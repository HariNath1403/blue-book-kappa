The burden of \nmultidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is increasing both globally and locally. WHO \nestimated about 480,000 people develop MDR-TB worldwide in 20131. The number of \npeople diagnosed with MDR -TB tripled between 2009 and 2013, and reached 13 6,000 \nworldwide. In Malaysia, there were 101 cases of MDR-TB reported in 2015 (refer to Fig. \n1)2.

Besides the toll on the health of in dividuals \nsuffering from MDR -TB, the cost  is also devastating economically .

Case finding for drug -resistant TB \nrefers to the process of:  \n• identifying individuals who may have drug -resistant TB;  \n• evaluating them appropriately;  \n• diagnosing drug -resistant TB;  \n• recording and reporting any drug -resistant TB diagnosed according to standardized criteria  \n \n5.1 Risk factors for DR -TB \n \nRisk factors for DR -TB are shown in Table 4.  \n \nTable 4 : Risk factor for DR -TB \n \nRisk factors for DR -TB Risk group  \nFailure of retreatment regimens \nwith first line anti -TB drugs \n(SHREZ), (previously known as \nchronic TB cases)  Patients who are still sputum smear -positive at the \nend of a retreatment regimen have perhaps the \nhighest MDR -TB rates in any group, often \napproaching 90%.  \nFailure of new TB regimens  \n(HREZ)  \n Patients who, while on treatment, are sputum smear -\npositive at month five or later during the course of \ntreatment. Not all patients in whom a regimen fails have drug- resistant TB, and the percentage may \ndepend on a number of factors, including whether rifampicin was used in the continuation phase and \nwhether  directly observed therapy was used \nthroughout treatment.  \nExposure to a known drug \nresistant  TB case  Most studies have shown that close contacts of MDR-\nTB patients have very high rates of MDR -TB. \nFailure of anti -TB treatment in \nthe private sector  \n Anti-TB regimens from the private sector can vary \ngreatly. A detailed history of drugs used is essential. If \nboth isoniazid and rifampicin were used, the chances \nof MDR -TB may be high. Sometimes second -line anti -\nTB drugs may have been used, and this is important \ninformation for designing the retreatment regimen."

LABORATORY ASPECTS  \n \nDefinitive diagnosis of drug- resistant TB (DR -TB) requires that Mycobacterium tuberculosis  \n(MTB) bacteria to be detected and determined its resistance to anti -TB drugs. This chapter \ndescribes standards for laboratory services needed to diagnose and treat drug- resistant TB in \nthe context of existing laboratory capacity.   \n \nLaboratory  detection of DR -TB consist of ; \n• identification of the isolate as belonging to the MTB complex.  \n• drug susceptibility testing (DST)  \n• WHO- endorsed molecular test to detect TB DNA and mutations associated with \nresistance  \n \n6.1 Essential laboratory services and i nfrastructure  \n  \nCulture isolation method is essential for monitoring DR-TB patients’ response to therapy. \nMinimum requirement in DR-TB programme also includes the capacity to reliably identify M. \ntuberculosis  and detect resistance to rifampicin and isoniazid.  \n \n The roles of laboratory in DR-TB are; \n• diagnostic and clinical services  \n• surveillance  of drug resistance patterns; for providing information on the degree and \ntrends in drug resistance, for developing appropriate treatment modalities, and for \nevaluating the impact of control program interventions.  \n Quality Management System (QMS) is neces sary for the laboratory to be implemented to \nensure that all aspects of laboratory diagnostic services are performed properly and allow for \nthe detection of any labor atory error s. QMS is  necessary to ensure accurate detection of drug \nresistance and also to avoid false diagnoses. In addition, documented first -line DST proficiency, \npreferably by the reference laboratory , is strongly recommended for drug -resistant TB control \nprogrammes.  \n \nQuality Management System  should include;  \n• standard operating procedures (SOPs)  \n• internal quality c ontrol  \n• external quality a ssessment  \n \nEstablishing and maintaining laboratory networks is challenging, difficult and costly. Adequate \nhuman and financial resource allocation is therefore crucial to ensure the availability of qualif ied \nand trained laboratory staff and for the functioning of the laboratory infrastructure with \nappropriate level of biosafety, well -maintained equipment and sufficient consumables.  \n 6.2 Organisation of the TB laboratory network   \n \nTB laboratory networks have a pyramidal structure with peripheral laboratories (health clinics/ \nsmear microscopy centre) accessible to all presumptive/known TB patients, intermediate \nlaboratories (culture centres/ID and DST centres) and a single/central la boratory (National TB \nReference Laboratory). Different levels of biosafety precautions are needed depending on the \ntype of test being performed and the risk of generation of infectious aerosol, with the most"

In many settings, this implies \ncentralization of laboratory services for DST.  \nWHO policy guidance on  DST 2014 (5)  is as follows :  \n• Laboratory capacity to reliably detect rifampicin resistance and/or MDR- TB through \nmolecular tests and/or quality -assured DST of isoniazid and rifampicin resistance is a \nminimum requirement for drug -resistant -TB programmes.  \n• Formal links with one of the laboratories of the SRL network is needed to ensure appropriate \ninfrastructure for the procedures being performed and proper diagnostic algorithms and \nquality assurance mechanisms in place.  \n• Strategies for laboratory services in  support of drug -resistant TB programmes should follow \na systems approach (refer to figure 5 ) and take into account the DST limitations outlined Management of DR- TB (First Edition)  \n \n17 \n Second -line \ninjectable \nagents \n Streptomycine Solid, \nliquid  4.0 2.0 2.0 1.0 \nKanamycin  Solid, \nliquid  30.0 5.0 6.0 2.5 \nAmikacin  Solid, \nliquid  30.0 4.0 - 1.0 \nCapreomycin Solid, \nliquid  40.0 4.0 - 2.5 \nOther core \nsecond -line \nagentsi Ethionamide  Solid, \nliquid   40.0 5.0 10.0 5.0 \nProthionamide Solid, \nliquid  40.0 - - 2.5 \nCycloserine  Solid  30.0 - - - \nLinezolid  Liquid - - - 1.0 \nClofazimine None - - - - \nAdd-on agents \n(not part of the \ncore MDR -TB \nregimen)  High dose \nisoniazid  Liquid - - - - \n Amoxicillin/ \nclavulanate None - - - - \n Para -\naminosalicylic \nacid Solid, \nliquid  1.0 \n 2.0 \n 8.0 \n 4.0 \na WHO Guidelines for the programmatic management of drug -resistant TB.  \nb Indirect proportion method recommended.

DST for ethambutol, streptomycin, pyrazinamide, Group A, C and D \ndrugs presents problems with accuracy and reproducibility in most set tings. DST to \npyrazinamide is not reliable and for this reason it is considered an acceptable practice to use \npyrazinamide in a regimen even when a laboratory result demonstrates resistance. More \nstudies need to be done to evaluate pyrazinamide DST in the future. Ethambutol is not routinely \nadded to conventional MDR regimen, however, it can be used if the criteria of it being a likely \neffective drug are met.  \n \nThe Xpert MTB/RIF  assay can be used as initial diagnostic tool for MDR -TB if available. \nMalaysia ad vocate that Xpert MTB/RIF  to be  used for diagnosis of rifampicin resistance in \nadults and children:  \na. Xpert MTB/RIF  should be used rather than conventional microscopy, culture and DST as \nthe initial diagnostic test in adults suspected of having MDR -TB or HIV -associated TB \n(strong recommendation, high -quality evidence).  \nb. Xpert MTB/RIF  should be used rather than conventional microscopy, culture and DST as \nthe initial diagnostic test in children suspected of having MDR -TB or HIV -associated TB \n(strong recommendati on, very low -quality evidence).  \n7.5 Designing and administrating an MDR regimen  \n This section describes the methods for designing and administrating an MDR regimen. It applies \nto standardised and individualised regimens.  \n \n7.5.1 General principles  \n The following are the basic principles involved in the treatment of MDR -TB; \na. usage of “likely effective” drugs.  \nAnti-TB drug is considered “likely to be effective” when;  \n• the drug has not been used in a regimen that failed to cure the individual patient;  \n• DST per formed on the patient’s strain indicates that it is susceptible to the drug  \n• No known resistance to drugs with high cross- resistance  \n• No known close contacts with resistance to the drug  \n• Drug resistance surveys demonstrate that resistance is rare to the drug  in patients with \nsimilar TB history.  \n• In the treatment of patients with MDR -TB, ethionamide (or prothionamide) should be \nused provided no contraindication such as a severe adverse effects.  \n• More than five drugs can be used depending on the effectiveness of  the drugs for \nexample in XDR -TB.  \n \nb. dosage and frequency of the drugs  \n• The drug dosage is usually determined by age and weight.  \n• All anti- TB drugs can be started at full dose. However, if tolerance is an issue, \ncycloserine, ethionamide and PAS dosing can be  increased gradually over a two -week \nperiod.  \n• Pyrazinamide, ethambutol and fluoroquinolones should be given once a day.  \n• Ethionamide/prothionamide, cycloserine and PAS have traditionally been given in split doses during the day to reduce adverse effects.  Management of DR- TB (First Edition)  \n \n26 \n • Injectable drugs can be given once daily, five to seven days a week.

DST for ethambutol, streptomycin, pyrazinamide, Group A, C and D \ndrugs presents problems with accuracy and reproducibility in most set tings. DST to \npyrazinamide is not reliable and for this reason it is considered an acceptable practice to use \npyrazinamide in a regimen even when a laboratory result demonstrates resistance. More \nstudies need to be done to evaluate pyrazinamide DST in the future. Ethambutol is not routinely \nadded to conventional MDR regimen, however, it can be used if the criteria of it being a likely \neffective drug are met.  \n \nThe Xpert MTB/RIF  assay can be used as initial diagnostic tool for MDR -TB if available. \nMalaysia ad vocate that Xpert MTB/RIF  to be  used for diagnosis of rifampicin resistance in \nadults and children:  \na. Xpert MTB/RIF  should be used rather than conventional microscopy, culture and DST as \nthe initial diagnostic test in adults suspected of having MDR -TB or HIV -associated TB \n(strong recommendation, high -quality evidence).  \nb. Xpert MTB/RIF  should be used rather than conventional microscopy, culture and DST as \nthe initial diagnostic test in children suspected of having MDR -TB or HIV -associated TB \n(strong recommendati on, very low -quality evidence).  \n7.5 Designing and administrating an MDR regimen  \n This section describes the methods for designing and administrating an MDR regimen. It applies \nto standardised and individualised regimens.  \n \n7.5.1 General principles  \n The following are the basic principles involved in the treatment of MDR -TB; \na. usage of “likely effective” drugs.  \nAnti-TB drug is considered “likely to be effective” when;  \n• the drug has not been used in a regimen that failed to cure the individual patient;  \n• DST per formed on the patient’s strain indicates that it is susceptible to the drug  \n• No known resistance to drugs with high cross- resistance  \n• No known close contacts with resistance to the drug  \n• Drug resistance surveys demonstrate that resistance is rare to the drug  in patients with \nsimilar TB history.  \n• In the treatment of patients with MDR -TB, ethionamide (or prothionamide) should be \nused provided no contraindication such as a severe adverse effects.  \n• More than five drugs can be used depending on the effectiveness of  the drugs for \nexample in XDR -TB.  \n \nb. dosage and frequency of the drugs  \n• The drug dosage is usually determined by age and weight.  \n• All anti- TB drugs can be started at full dose. However, if tolerance is an issue, \ncycloserine, ethionamide and PAS dosing can be  increased gradually over a two -week \nperiod.  \n• Pyrazinamide, ethambutol and fluoroquinolones should be given once a day.  \n• Ethionamide/prothionamide, cycloserine and PAS have traditionally been given in split doses during the day to reduce adverse effects.  Management of DR- TB (First Edition)  \n \n26 \n • Injectable drugs can be given once daily, five to seven days a week. If adverse effects \noccur, injectable agent may be given three times a week, preferably only after culture \nconversion.  \n• Oral drugs are to be given seven days a week under DOT.  \n• Pyrazinamide can be used for the entire treatment since many drug -resistant TB \npatients have chronically inflammed lungs as Pyrazinamide is more effective in the \nacidic environment. In Rifampicin Resistant patients, high -dose isoniazid may be \nincluded in the MDR regimen until DST to isoniazid is available.  \n \nc. addressing the Adverse effect  \n• To avoid the drugs that is known to have a strong contraindication of usage due to \ndrug– drug interactions, overlying toxicities, co- morbidities, history of severe allergy or \nother advers e reactions and pregnancy.  \n• Any adverse effects of drugs that occurs should be managed immediately and \nadequately to relief suffering, minimize the risk of treatment interruptions, and prevent \nmorbidity and mortality due to serious adverse effects.  \n \nd. TB-HIV co-morbidity  \nAntiretroviral therapy (ART) is recommended for all patients with HIV and drug- resistant TB, \nirrespective of CD4 cell -count, as early as possible following initiation of the anti -TB \ntreatment.  \n \n7.5.2 Suggestion for conventional DR- TB regimen  \n \nTable 9 shows suggestion for conventional DR -TB regimen.  \n \nTable  9: Suggestion  for conventional DR -TB regimen \n \n Drug Group  Name of Drugs  Remark \nStep 1  Choose one \nfrom Group A \n Levofloxacin \nMoxifloxacin  \nGatifloxacin  \n Use a later generation \nfluoroquinolone.

The most important evidence of \nimprovement is conversion of the sputum culture to negative. Sputum smear is still use ful due to \nits shorter turnaround time. Delayed detection of failure can increase transmission and increase \nthe probability of acquisition resistance to the patient’s strain, making it harder to cure the \npatient after failure.  \nRecommendation 16  \n• The use of sputum smear microscopy and culture rather than sputum smear microscopy \nalone is recommended for the monitoring of patients with multidrug - resistant TB (MDR -\nTB) during treatment.  \n  \nCulture conversion should not be taken as equivalent to cure. Monthly sputum  smear and TB \nculture should continue to b e performed  during maintanence phase . This is because Initial \nculture conversion is not always maintained.

Checks sputum culture six monthly for two \nyears after  completion date to evaluate for possible recurrence.  Management of DR- TB (First Edition)  \n \n47 \n Monthl y monitoring of sputum smears and cultures throughout treatment enables the \nprogramme to timely identify conversion or failure to convert. The most important evidence of \nimprovement is conversion of the sputum culture to negative. Sputum smear is still use ful due to \nits shorter turnaround time. Delayed detection of failure can increase transmission and increase \nthe probability of acquisition resistance to the patient’s strain, making it harder to cure the patient after failure.  \nRecommendation 16  \n• The use of sputum smear microscopy and culture rather than sputum smear microscopy \nalone is recommended for the monitoring of patients with multidrug - resistant TB (MDR -\nTB) during treatment.  \n  \nCulture conversion should not be taken as equivalent to cure. Monthly sputum  smear and TB \nculture should continue to b e performed  during maintanence phase . This is because Initial \nculture conversion is not always maintained. Some patients can have culture reversion in a later \ndate.   \n \nMolecular tests such as Xpert MTB/RIF  and line probe assays should not be used to monitor \nresponse to treatment.  \n \nDST can be repeated for patients who remain smear and culture positive or who are suspects \nfor treatment failure. In such cases, it is usually not necessary to repeat DST within less than \ntwo to three months of the previous DST.  \n \nA key component of monitoring  the progress of treatment is patient -centred DOT . All treatment \nshould be given under daily  DOT  and DOT providers sho uld be trained on the symptoms of \nadverse effects and t reatment failure.  \n \nTable  18 summarizes the activities for monitoring treatment re sponse.  \n \nTable 18: Activities for monitoring treatment response  \n \nMonitoring evaluation  Recommended frequency  \nEvaluation by clinician  During the intensive phase :  \n• Every day during the first week if hospitalized and at \nleast every week if treated as an outpatient,until the \ntreatment is well tolerated.  \n• Once stable the patient is seen at least once a month.  \nDuring the maintanence  phase:  \n• Monthly assessment unless there is a medical \nnecessity to see the patient more often.  \n• The DOT supporter sees the patient daily between \nconsultations and signals any concerns to the clinician.  \nTreatment adherence and tolerance Daily at every DOT encounter by the DOT provider.  \nSputum smears and culture  Monthly thoughout the treatment period."

Oxygen may be used to alleviate shortness of breath in some \ncases but there is no signif icant evidence to generalize its practice. Morphine provides \nsignificant relief from respiratory insufficiency and should be offered according to \nestablished clinical protocols available in the medical literature.  \n• Relief from pain and other symptoms.  Paracetamol, or codeine with paracetamol, \ngives relief from moderate pain. If possible, stronger analgesics, including morphine, \nshould be used when appropriate to keep the patient adequately comfortable.  The WHO \nhas developed analgesic guides, pain scales and a three step “ladder” for pain relief . \n• Infection control measures.  The patient who is taken off anti -TB treatment because of \nfailure often remains infectious. Infection control measures should be continued with \nreinforcement of environmental and pers onal measures, including N -95 mask use for \ncaregivers.  \n• Nutritional support.  Small and frequent meals are often best for a person at the end of \nlife. It should be accepted that the intake will reduce as the patient’s condition deteriorates \nand during end- of-life care. Nausea and vomiting or any other conditions that interfere \nwith nutritional support should be treated.  \n• Regular medical visits.  When MDR -TB treatment stops, regular visits by health -care \nproviders and the support team should be continued to addr ess medical needs and \nensure that infection control practices are being followed.  \n• Continuation of ancillary medicines.  All necessary ancillary medications should be \ncontinued as needed. Codeine helps control cough, as well as pain. Other cough \nsuppressants can be added.

Oxygen may be used to alleviate shortness of breath in some \ncases but there is no signif icant evidence to generalize its practice. Morphine provides \nsignificant relief from respiratory insufficiency and should be offered according to \nestablished clinical protocols available in the medical literature.  \n• Relief from pain and other symptoms.  Paracetamol, or codeine with paracetamol, \ngives relief from moderate pain. If possible, stronger analgesics, including morphine, \nshould be used when appropriate to keep the patient adequately comfortable.

However, a chest x -\nray and sputum culture and DST should be done if suspected  of extrapulmonary TB since the \ncontact may have a concomitant Pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB. \n 15.1.2 Contact screening for symptomatic paediatric contacts  \n \nMDR/XDR -TB close contact among children is at higher risk of infection and  developing an \nactive  TB. Furthermore, diagnosis of active TB among children is more difficult and challenging \nbecause they may have nonspecific symptoms such as  failure to thrive and recurrent  fever.  \nThey must be followed -up for at least two years and treated promptly with recommended \nregimen if active disease develops (MOH, 2012) .\n  \n• Clinical evaluation by history and physical examination  \n• Chest x- ray \n• TST \n• Sputum smear microscopy  \n• Sputum MTB culture & DST  \n• Rapid test such as Xpert MTB/RIF  (if available ) \n \nYoung children often produ ced insufficient and poor quality of sputum samples. Gastric \naspiration and sputum induction are widely used as they are more safe and effective. If any of \nthe recommended tests are not available or the results are not conclusive, clinical judgement \ncan st ill be used to make a diagnosis of MDR/XDR -TB among children. The presence of three \nor more symptoms and signs of the following should strongly suggest an active TB: \n• Chronic symptoms suggestive of TB \\Physical signs highly suggestive of TB  \n• A positive TST  \n• Chest x- ray suggestive if active TB  \n \nThe subsequent follow -up and schedule for contacts among children is similar to an adult . \n \n15.1.3 Contact screening for asymptomatic contacts  \n All asymptomatic contact should be screened with : \n• Chest x- ray \n• TST \nSubsequent  visit for asymptomatic contact with no evidence of active TB in the first screening  \nwill include repeat  physical examination and chest x -ray at  3, 6, 12 months intervals.  \n  Management of DR- TB (First Edition)  \n \n58 \n 15.2 Empirical treatment  of MDR/XDR -TB contacts  \n \nContacts who develop active TB should undergo rapid test such as Xpert MTB/RIF .

However, most of the \nclose contact is infected with the same MDR/XDR strain.  \n• Rapid molecular test  should be performed to all bacteriologically confirmed contacts.  \n• In the absence of rapid molecular test, confirmation of drug resistance with conventional \nmethod may take weeks or months.  \n• These contacts should be treated empirically with same anti -TB regimen as the index case \nwhile pending DST. \n• MDR/XDR -TB empirical treatment may include Isoniazide and Rifampicin base on clinical \njudgement b y physician because it is easier to switch to first line anti -TB regimen if DST \nresult showed  pan-susceptible.  \n• However, ineffective regimen at long period may result in amplification of resistance or \ndeath.  \n \n15.2.2 Extrapulmonary TB contacts  \n \n• Certain Extrapulmonary TB is often culture  negative. Therefore, contacts with \nextrapulmonary TB should be started empirically with MDR/XDR -TB regimen as the index \ncase after collecting samples from suspected organs for histopathology examination, culture \nand DST.  \n• MDR/XDR -TB empirical treatment may include Isoniazide and Rifampicin base on clinical \njudgement by physician because it is easier to switch to first line antiTB regimen if DST \nresult showed pan -susceptible.  \n• This is particularly important for HIV p atients w here most of the times  are smear  and culture  \nnegative. They are also at risk of developing severe forms of extrapulmonary TB that are \nhighly fatal.  \n \n15.2.3 Culture negative TB contacts  \n \n• For MDR/XDR -TB contacts under 5 years, most  are likely to be infected by same resistant \nmycobacterium strain of the index case.  \n• This is particularly important for contacts among children who often, had poor quality  sputum \nsamples.  \n• If the children fulfil the criteria for active TB, they should be considered for second -line \ntreatment of MDR/XDR -TB based on the clinical judgement.  \n \n15.3 Chemoprophylaxis of contacts  of MDR -TB index case  \n \nWHO does not recommend the universal use of second -line anti-TB drugs for chemoprophylaxis \nof MDR/XDR -TB contact s."

        "text": "Management of DR-TB (First Edition)69Management of DR- TB (First Edition)  \n \n69 \n Checklist of information and education issues to provide to patient and family \ncaregivers before starting MDR -TB treatment  \n• Inform the patient about the length of treatment according to the regimen selected – \noften at least 20 months, but it may be shorter or longer.  \n• Discuss where treatment will start. If at a ho spital, estimate the approximate length of \ntime. If at home,  ask about the home living situation and whether or not the patient feels \nhome treatment will be possible.  \n• Teach the patient about the drugs in general terms: i.e. there are at least five differen t \nanti-TB drugs, which the patient will take, of which one is an injectable agent. Try to \nteach the names of the drugs and show what the pills look like.  \n• Teach the patient about possible side effects and the actions to take once detected, \nincluding reporti ng to the DOT provider, especially those with serious consequences \nlike any hearing loss, ringing in the ears or suicidal ideation.  \n• Teach the patient about monitoring requirements for smear, culture and laboratory tests \nfor early detection of side effects.  \n• Make sure that patients and caregivers know how to make an appointment if they need \nto be seen before the next routine visit.  \n• Make sure they know that the DOT provider can contact a doctor urgently at any time of \nthe day.  \n• Instruct them what to do in case of an emergency (like severe shortness of breath, \nseizure, etc.)  \n• Always provide a copy of the TB Patient Charter , informing t he patients about their \nrights and responsibilities related with the treatment and prevention and control of TB;  \n• Inform patient and family caregivers on social support and social protection options the \npatient is eligible for according to the existing law  in the country, including palliative and \nend-of-life care as needed.  \n \n19.2.3 Emotional support  \nHaving MDR -TB can be an emotionally devastating experience for patients and their social \nnetworks. Considerable stigma is attached to the disease, and this may  interfere with adherence \nto therapy, and may badly affect the quality of life of patients in view of the discrimination that \nfollows stigma.  \nThe provision of emotional support services to patients may increase the likelihood of therapy \nadherence, and the  acquisition of skills to deal with stigma and discrimination. This support may \nbe organized in the form of support groups or in one -to one counselling by trained providers.  \nInformal support can also be p rovided by physicians, nurses , DOT providers, drug -resistant TB \nsupporters and family members. The establishment of support groups may allow patients with \ndrug- resistant TB to meet and socialize with other patients and provide e motional support to \neach other.  \nPsychological support to MDR -TB patients through peer -to-peer and group support  \n• A counsellor, social worker or someone trained in facilitating support groups should \nfacilitate the meeting.  A trained drug -resistant TB community nurse or health worker \nmay co -facilitate the group  \n• Clear eligibility criteria should be created for participation in each support group:     \n• Participation should be generally reserved for patients who are sputum negative and are \nno longer infectious, especially if the meeting cannot take place in an open s pace.    Management of DR- TB (First Edition)  \n \n70 \n • Cured patients may also be invited to support groups, as they provide hope to patients \nwho are still on treatment.  \n• Some groups may be reserved for patients with serious psychosocial issues and may \nrequire a facilitator with psychiatric training.  \n• Other groups may be largely self -organized and appropriate only for patients without \npsychiatric issues.  \n• Support groups may need help in inviting participants, finding a safe meeting place and \nother organizational issues.  \n• At the end of each support group me eting, the facilitator and co -facilitator should stay \nbehind to discuss and analyse the lessons learned in the process and plan the next \nsession.   \n \n19.2.4 Material support  \nPoverty, depression, stigmatization, discrimination and perceived isolation are common among \ndrug- resistant TB patients. Socioeconomic problems – not only hunger, homelessness and \nunemployment, but also family responsibilities – should be addressed to enab le patients and \ntheir families to adhere to MDR -TB treatment and reduce the impact that the disease and \ntreatment have on their quality of life. Needy patient can be referred to relevant agencies for \nfinancial support and assistance.  \n19.2.5 Companionship s upport  \nOn-site social support for patients and their support networks through peer counselling can help \nto contribute to the effectiveness of TB programmes. These “community champions/expert \npatients” would follow each patient from diagnosis through to cu re, and they would act as both \n“friend” and educator. From the patient’s perspective, having this companion available greatly reduces the psychological burden of the long duration of treatment and provides them with skills \nto cope wit h TB stigma and discri mination.  \n19.3 Planning and managing social support for MDR -TB patients  \nIn order to support people with drug -resistant TB during their treatment, health policy and \npractice must appreciate that TB affects all aspects of patients’ lives. A focus on caring for each \npatient as an individual should underlie all aspects of treatment and care.  Overall, the following \nprinciples can be followed for good care and support:  \ni. Develop a treatment partnership with your patient.  \nii. Focus on your patient’s concerns and priori ties. \niii. Use the 5 A’s: Assess, Advise, Agree, Assist and Arrange (see Box) (9)  \niv. Link the patient with a “DOT provider” for MDR -TB regimens supporter.  \nv. Support patient self -management, as it relates to personal care and needs.  \nvi. Organize proactive follow -up care.  \nvii. Involve “expert patients,” peer educators and support staff in your health facility.  \nviii. Link the patient to community -based resources and support.  \nix. Use written information –  registers, treatment plans, treatment cards and written \nInformation for patients – for documenting, monitoring and reminding.  \nx. Work as a team.  \nxi. Assure continuity of care."

Most commonly, this system will involve \nthe drug -resistant TB clinic or community nurse, doctor or supervisor assisting the drug -resistant \nTB DOT supporter by visiting the patient’s home the same day  to find out why the patient has \ndefaulted and ensure that treatment is resumed promptly and effectively. The situation should \nbe addressed in a sympathetic, friendly and non -judgmental manner. Every effort should be \nmade to listen to the patient’s reasons  for missing a dose(s) and to work with the patient and the \nfamily to en sure continuation of treatment.  \nThe following steps should be taken for patients showing any signs of possible poor adherence:  \n• Home visit by the health -care provider involved in the drug -resistant TB programme: The \ndrug- resistant TB clinic or community nurse, doctor or supervisor should visit the home of \nthe patient together with, or in addition to, the drug -resistant TB DOT suppo rter, as during \nthe home visit it may be possible to identify more clinical problems than during the monthly \nclinic evaluation.  \n• Manage side effects: This is one of the most common reasons for the MDR -TB patient to be \nlost to follow -up.  \n• Counselling: The patient may no longer want to continue treatment because he/she feels better, and therefore, feels treatment is no longer necessary. Additionally, the patient’s \nperspective about his/her care should be assessed. The patient may have greater \nconfidence in al ternative or folk medicine. If this is the case, the drug -resistant TB DOT \nsupporter, along with a nurse, doctor or community supervisor, should explore ways in \nwhich to meet the patient’s needs, all the while putting them back on treatment.  \n• Address economic problems: Many patients are unable to work when they are ill, and may \nbe the primary wage earners for their family. An assessment related to basic housing, food and clothing needs should be explored and ways to assist with these issues add ressed.  \n• Address addiction or other social problems: Alcohol consumption and drug abuse are known issues, which affect treatment adherence. Patients should be encouraged to stop or decrease consumption.  \n• Involve the family: Family is the most important sour ce of psychosocial support for the \npatient. When a patient has no family, have the patient identify a person who can act as a caregiver.  \n• Involve community leaders: Community and religious leaders can be helpful if there are \ncommunity -wide issues, such as stigma towards drug -resistant TB patients.

The first date is determined by type of risk category. This date may correspond to when TB is \ndiagn osed if universal DST is practised, or when a \nlaboratory result indicates treatment failure or persistent \nsputum smear positivity during the course of TB \ntreatment, or when HIV -associated TB is detected.
