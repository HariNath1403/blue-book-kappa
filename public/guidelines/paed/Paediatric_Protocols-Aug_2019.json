        "text": "iiiFOREWORD BY THE DIRECTOR-GENERAL OF HEALTH, MALAYSIA\n1.  First and foremost, I would like to thank the Editorial Board and it is my \npleasure to write the foreword for the Paediatric Protocols for Malaysia \nHospital 4th Edition. \n2.  Since independence, the Malaysian health system has achieved remark -\nable outcomes in improving the health status of the population. \nLife expectancy at birth has increased by more than 10 years, driven by rapid \ndeclines in infant, child, and maternal mortality. However, over the past 15 \nyears, the declines in maternal and child mortality rates have plateaued, \nwith no further notable improvement.\n3.  Over the years, we have seen the introduction of new technologies in \nhealth system. Healthcare workers must keep up with current therapeutics \ndevelopments and ensure that they provide safe, appropriate and effective \ntreatment to their patients. Clearly, then, the development and maintenance \nof effective therapeutic skills is essential especially to those working in acute \nsettings. \n4.  This pocket book is mainly aimed at doctors, clinical officers, nurses and \nother healthcare workers who are responsible for the care of sick newborns \nand young children. These protocols are meant to serve as a guide for clinical \npractice, based on the best available evidence at the time of development. \nEvery healthcare worker is responsible for the management of their patient \nbased on the clinical features presented by the patient and the management \noptions available locally. We hope this handy pocket sized booklet will also be \nuseful to students in medical schools and other training institutions.\nDatuk  Dr Noor Hisham bin Abdullah\nDirector-General of Health, Malaysia"

        "text": "ivFOREWORD TO THE FOURTH EDITION, 2ND PRINT\n It has been 13 years since we produced the first edition of a \nnational protocol book for Paediatrics. This effort was of course inspired by \nthe Sarawak Paediatric Protocols initiated by Dr Tan Poh Tin. The 3rd edition \nin 2012 has proven to be very popular and is now the standard reference for \nHouse officers and Medical Officers in Paediatrics. \n In producing a fourth edition we have retained the layout of the \ncurrent version, updating the contents and colour scheme. Again it is targeted \nat young doctors in the service many of whom seem to have had a subopti -\nmal exposure to paediatrics in their undergraduate years. It is hoped that the \nprotocol book will help them fill in the gaps as they prepare to serve in district \nhospitals and health clinics. The use of the book has extended way beyond its \ninitial targeted audience. \n We want to thank the Ministry of Health of Malaysia which has \nonce again agreed to support the printing of the book for distribution to MOH \nfacilities. We will continue to make the full PDF version available for download \non the Malaysian Paediatric Association website.  We hope that in time the \nprotocol will be available as an iOS and android app.\n As previously this new edition is only possible because of the will-\ningness of busy clinicians to chip in and update the content for purely altruistic \nreasons and we hope this spirit will persist in our fraternity. We want to thank \nall the contributors and reviewers for this edition. Professor Frank Shann has \ngraciously agreed for the latest edition of his drug dosages handbook to be \nincorporated into the 4th edition (only available in MOH prints). The Frank \nShann-Drug Doses Book (17th edition) can also be purchased through orders@\ndrugdoses.com, the Apple App Store (iOS) or Google PlayStore (Android). See also \nwww.drugdoses.com. The Director General of Health has also kindly provided a \nforeword to this edition. \n In the 2nd Print of the 4th Edition, we took the opportunity to make \ncorrections for errors that were discovered after the document had been in \ncirculation for some time.  Minor corrections were made in a few documents.  \n Substantial changes were made to three Chapters. In the Chapter \n109 Common Poisons, an important correction was made to the N-Acetyl -\ncysteine dosage regimen for treatment of paracetamol poisoning and the Toxi -\ndromes table was expanded, amongst other corrections. Additional material \nand updates were also added to Chapter 32 Asthma and Chapter 36 Empyema \nThoracis, at the request of the Paediatric Respiratory Physicians.\n We wish to thank all who have made this new edition possible and \nhope this combined effort will help in improving the wellbeing of the children \nentrusted to our care. \nHussain Imam B. Hj Muhammad Ismail \nHishamshah b. Mohd Ibrahim \nNg Hoong Phak \nTerrence Thomas"

Precise calculations (e.g. 4.5%) are not necessary. \n    The rate of rehydration should be adjusted with ongoing clinical assessment.\n • Use an isotonic solution for replacement of the deficit, e.g. 0.9% saline.\n • Reassess clinical status and weight at 4-6hours, and if satisfactory continue. \n     If child is losing weight, increase the fluid and if weight gain is excessive \n     decrease the fluid rate. \n • Replacement may be rapid in most cases of gastroenteritis (best achieved \n     by oral or nasogastric fluids), but should be slower in diabetic ketoacidosis \n     and meningitis, and much slower in hypernatremic states (aim to rehydrate \n     over 48-72 hours, the serum Na should not fall by >0.5mmol/l/hr).\nOngoing losses (e.g. from drains, ileostomy, profuse diarrhoea)\n • These are best measured and replaced.

The drawings of bright \nchildren more than 10 years old or those who have had drawing lessons will \nresult in an invalid evaluation of the child’s intellectual potential.  \nSCORING\nCLASS A  Preliminary Stage in which the drawing cannot be recognized as a \nhuman figure:\n1. Aimless uncontrolled scribbling – score 0.  \n2. Lines somewhat controlled – approaches crude geometrical form – score 1.\nCLASS B  All drawings that can be recognized as attempts to represent the \nhuman figure.  Each point is scored plus or minus.  One credit for each point \nscored plus and no half credits given.  \nGROSS DETAIL\n1. Head present\n2. Legs present.\n3. Arms present\n4. Trunk present\n5. Length of trunk greater than breadth.\n6. Shoulders are indicated (abrupt broadening of trunk below neck)\nATTACHMENTS \n1. Both arms and legs attached to trunk.\n2.

Difficulties learning as  indicated by the presence of at least 1 of the \nfollowing  for at least 6 months, despite provision of adequate intervention:\n1. Inaccurate or slow and effortful word reading.\n2. Difficulty understanding the meaning of what is read. \n3. Difficulties with spelling.\n4. Difficulties with written expression. \n5. Difficulties mastering number sense, number facts, or calculation. \n6. Difficulties with mathematical  reasoning. \nB. The affected academic skills are below expected for the individual’s \nchronological age and cause significant interference with academic \nperformance  or ADL as confirmed by standardized achievement measures \nand comprehensive clinical assessment. \nC. May begin during school-age years but may not become fully manifest \nuntil later, when the academic requirements exceed the child’s  limited \ncapacities.\nD. Not better accounted for by intellectual disability, sensory impairments, \nmental or neurological disorders, psychosocial adversity or inadequate \neducational exposure.\nIn Specific Learning Disorder more than one domain may be affected:\n• Impairment in reading which affects word reading accuracy, reading rate or \nfluency and reading comprehension.

If bowels are exposed, heat and fluid loss are compounded \nby evaporation. The effects of hypothermia are acidosis and subsequent \nPPHN, impaired immune function and delayed wound healing. \nHypoglycemia\nThe neonate lacks glycogen stores in liver and fat deposits.\nMode of transport \n• Careful consideration must be made as to the mode of transport. \n• The best mode of transfer is “in utero”, e.g. a mother in premature \nlabour should be managed in a centre with NICU facilities or for an \nantenatally detected surgical, the mother should be advised to deliver at a \ncentre with paediatric surgical facilities. \n• The advantages and disadvantages of road, air (helicopter / commercial \nairlines) and riverine transport must be considered in each child\n• Transport incubators with monitors, ventilators, oxygen and suction \nequipment are ideal.

        "text": "75Air Transport\nPatients  can be transported by either commercial airlines with pressurised \ncabins or by helicopters flying without pressurised cabins at lower altitudes. \nThere are special problems associated with air transport:\n• Changes in altitude  – Reduced atmospheric pressure causes decreased \noxygen concentration and expansion of gases. This may be important in \ninfants with pneumothorax, pneumoperitoneum, volvulus and intestinal \nobstruction. These must be drained before setting off as the gases will \nexpand and cause respiratory distress. Infants requiring oxygen may have \nincreased requirements and become more tachypnoeic at the higher \naltitude in non-pressurised cabins. \n• Poor lighting - Can make assessment of child difficult .\n• Noise and Vibration  – May stress the infant and transport team; \nMay also cause interference with the monitors, e.g. pulse oximeters. \nUse ear muffs if available. It is also impossible to perform any procedures \nduring transport.\n• Limited cabin space  – Limits access to the infant especially in helicopters. \nCommercial aircraft and helicopters are unable to accommodate transport \nincubators. The infant is thus held in the arms of a team member.\n• Weather conditions and availability of aircraft  – Speed of transfer may be \ncompromised by unavailability of aircraft/flight or weather conditions. \nStress and safety to the infant and team during poor weather conditions \nneeds to be considered. \n• Take off and landing areas  – special areas are required and there will be \nmultiple transfers: hospital – ambulance – helicopter – ambulance - hospital.\n• Finances  – Air transport is costly but essential where time is of essence.\nPre-transport Stabilisation \nTransport is a significant stress and the infant may easily deteriorate during the \njourney. Hypothermia, hypotension and metabolic acidosis has a significant \nnegative impact on the eventual outcome. Procedures are difficult to do during \nthe actual transport. Therefore, pre-transport stabilization is critical. \nThe principles of initial stabilisation of the neonate \n(see tables on following pages)\nAirway\nBreathing\nCirculation, Communication\nDrugs, Documentation\nEnvironment, Equipment\nFluids – electrolytes, glucose\nGastric decompressionNEONATOLOGY"

Pre-draw fluids, medication into syringes \n   if required during the journey. Tubings must not cross each other or \nunder tension to avoid dislodgement.\nFluid therapy\nResuscitation Fluid   \n• Give boluses of 10 - 20 mls/kg over up to 2 hours as per clinical status\n• Use Normal Saline or Hartmann’s solution.\n• If blood loss then use whole blood or pack red cells.\nThis fluid is also used to correct ongoing measured (e.g. orogastric) or \nthird space losses as required. The perfusion and heart rates are reliable \nindicators of the hydration.  \n• If ongoing or anticipated losses in surgical neonates, e.g. gastroschisis, \n   intestinal obstruction, , then use 0.45% Saline + 10% Dextrose\n• Watch out for hyponatraemia and hypoglycemia. Always check glucose \nlevel via a bedside glucometer before transport and regularly if indicated.\nGastric decompression\n• An orogastric tube is required in most surgical neonates, especially in \n   intestinal obstruction, congenital diaphragmatic hernia or abdominal \n   wall defects. \n• The oral route is preferred as a larger bore tube can be used without \n    compromising nasal passages (neonates are obligatory nasal breathers). \n• As an orogastric tube is easily dislodged, check the position regularly. \n• 4 hourly aspiration and free flow of gastric contents is recommended.NEONATALOGY"

Beyond this, state \nin completed days.\n• Weight  : Note birth weight and current weight.  An initial drop in weight \nis to be expected for newborn infants, term up to 10% BW in the first 3-5 \ndays and preterm up to 15% in first 1 week. Less weight loss is expected \nwith the use of humidified incubators. Abnormal weight gain or losses in \nthe first few days often implicate suboptimal fluid therapy\n• General condition  is to be noted - e.g. ill, unstable, handles poorly, \ndesaturates  on handling, stable, active, responsive to handling, improving, \nor good tone \n• Cardiopulmonary  system.  \n• Check for: \n   - Adequacy of the blood pressure – an estimate of normal BP for preterm \n     infant is that of the gestational age at birth . However, there is no \n     necessity to treat immediately  if the baby is stable, responsive and of \n     good tone. Review after one hour to check for improvement in the BP \n   - Signs of poor perfusion (with poor peripheral pulses, rapid pulse, poor \n     capillary refilling and cold peripheries) – but these signs have not \n     been found to be very reliable for hypotension. Hypothermia can also \n     be a cause of poor perfusion \n   - Examine for presence of  PDA in preterm infants\n• If BP is low and there has been a history of volume loss at birth or risk \n   of sepsis, infuse a fluid bolus of 10 ml/kg of Normal Saline. This may be  \n   repeated if there is no improvement.  After the 2nd dose of normal \n   saline, 5% albumin can be considered for volume expansion in severely \n   hypotensive infants. \n   Caution:  Risk of IVH in repeat doses especially in ELBW or ill preterm \n   infants – check first for  volume loss or reduced vascular volume due to \n   extravascular fluid losses such as in sepsis or intestinal obstruction. \n   Albumin is required only in severe sepsis such as in NEC. \n• Inotropic agents like adrenaline, dobutamine or dopamine may be needed. \n   Consider hydrocortisone in ill preterm infant at birth if no response to \n   volume or inotropes. Check that there is no iatrogenic hyperventilation \n   as a cause of hypotension.\n• Fluids and Electrolytes .\n• Is the volume and type of fluid given to the child appropriate?\n            Empiric fluid therapy for newborns:\n            0-24 hours  :  60 ml/kg/day\n            24-48 hours : 90ml/kg/day\n            48-72 hours : 120ml/kg/day\n            > 72 hours   : 150 ml/kg/day\n• Lower rate of increment for preterm infants of 20 mls/kg/day. \n   More increment may be needed if evidence of dehydration – excessive \n   weight loss and hypernatraemia >145 mmol/L.NEONATALOGY"

Numerous studies show \ngreater mortality and morbidity in late preterm infants compared with term \ninfants.\nManagement\n• All infants at birth must have a carefully documented assessment of \ngestational age.\n• Carefully observe for successful adaptation to extra-uterine life. \nInitial evaluation should include temperature, respiration and heart rate. \n• Admit/ refer  to a special care nursery/ neonatal intensive care unit if \nthere is cardiorespiratory instability and infant unable to feed.\n• Explain the differences of the term baby and the late preterm baby to \nparents. Reassure and support them.\nFeeding\n• Compared with term neonates, late preterm newborns are at increased \nrisk for feeding difficulty and dehydration.  Feeding should be supervised \nand established before discharged home.\n• Early feeding should be attempted.\n• Encourage breastfeeding on demand.\n• Educate and assist the mother to hand express and give EBM after all \nbreastfeeding or feeding attempts in the first few days. \n• Check concerns of mother regarding with lactation and refer to lactation \nnurse.\nThermal control\n• Since the late preterm is usually nursed in a cot, monitor the \ntemperature regularly as temperature instability is common.\n• Double wrap or use radiant warmer especially soon after birth if\n temperature is below 36.5oC.\n• Ensure that the baby is draped or wrapped well to prevent heat loss \nwhile doing skin to skin or breastfeeding.\nHypoglycaemia\n• Monitor for clinical signs of hypoglycaemia.\nApnoea \n• The incidence of apnea in late-preterm infants is reported to be \nbetween 4% and 7%, compared with less than 1% to 2% at term.\n• Consider continuous monitoring of the respiration and heart rate \nwhen there has been a recent or recurrent apneic episodes. \nJaundice\n• Ongoing observation of the baby for clinical signs of jaundice. Late pre\nterm babies are at increased risk of higher elevations of bilirubin at day 5 \nto 7 of life compared to term babies\n• Check transcutaneous bilirubin or serum bilirubin if there is a concern.

Although there is no direct evidence comparing fresh versus frozen \nmothers’ milk, this make sense because of the depletion of commensals, \nimmune cells, immune factors and enzyme activity that occurs during freezing.  \n• However, expressed breast milk (EBM) alone is not adequate for the \nnutritional needs of the very preterm infant as it has:\n• insufficient calories and protein to for optimal early growth at 20 kcal/30mls.\n• insufficient sodium to compensate for high renal sodium losses.\n• insufficient calcium or phosphate - predisposes to osteopenia of prematurity.\n• insufficient vitamins and iron relative to the needs of a preterm infant.\nHuman Milk Fortifier (HMF)\n• It is recommended to add HMF to EBM in babies < 32 wks or < 1500 grams.\n• HMF will give extra calories, vitamins, calcium and phosphate.\n• HMF should be added to EBM when the baby is feeding at 100 mls/kg/day.\n• Start HMF at concentration of 1 sachet: 50 mls EBM and if this is tolerated                                                \nfor 48 hours, increase to 1:25.

There are 2 \ntypes of infant formula: Preterm formula and Normal Term Formula. \n • Preterm formula : for babies born < 32 weeks or < 1500 grams. \n • Normal infant formula : for babies born ≥ 32 weeks or > 1500 grams.

Thus the orogastric route is \npreferable.\nContinuous vs. intermittent bolus feeding\n• Bolus fed babies tolerate feeds better and gained weight faster. Babies \non continuous feeding have been shown to take longer to reach full \nfeeding but there is no difference in days to discharge, somatic growth and \nincidence of necrotising enterocolitis (NEC).\nCup feeding\n• If the baby is able to suckle and mother is not with the baby, cup feeding \nis preferable to bottle feeding to prevent nipple confusion. \nWhen to start milk?\n• As soon as possible for the well term babies\n• However, in very preterm infants there may be an increased risk for NEC if  \nfeeding is advanced too rapidly, although early feeds with EBM is to be \nencouraged. Studies suggest that rapid increments in feeds has a higher \nrisk for NEC than the time at which feeding was started.\n• Start trophic feeding preferably within 24 hours if EBM available.\nCaution in ELBW babies or growth- restricted infants. If by 24-48 hours, \nand no EBM is available, consider a premature formula milk\n• Minimal enteral feeding (MEF)  is recommended in very preterm infants. \nThe principle is to commence very low volume enteral feeds on day 1 - 3 \nof life (i.e. 5 - 25 mls/kg/day) for both EBM and formula milk. \nMEF enhances gut DNA synthesis hence promotes gastrointestinal growth. \nThis approach allows earlier establishment of full enteral feeds and \nshorter hospital stays, without any concomitant increase in NEC. \nHow much to increase?\n• Generally the rate of increment is about 20 to 30 mls/kg/day.\n• Well term babies should be given breastfeeding on demand.\n• Milk requirements for babies on full enteral feed from birth:\n                 Day 1      60 mls/kg/day\n                 Day 2 – 3      90 mls/kg/day\n                 Day 4 – 6    120 mls/kg/day\n                 Day 7 onwards   150 mls/kg/day\n                 Add 15% if the baby is under phototherapy \n• In babies requiring IV fluids at birth: The rate of increment need to be \nindividualized to that baby. \n• Babies should be observed for feeding intolerance (vomit or large \naspirate) and observe for any abdominal distention before increasing the \nfeed."

        "text": "97What is the maximum volume?\n• Target weight gain should be around 15g/kg/day (range 10-25g/kg/day). \nLess weight gain than this suggests a need to increase calories especially \nprotein calories.. More weight gain than 30g/kg/day should raise the \npossibility of fluid overload particularly in babies with chronic lung disease.\n• Preterm infants\n• Increase feed accordingly to 180 to 200 mls/kg/day. (This should only be \nachieved by Day 10 to Day 14 respectively if baby had tolerated feeds \nwell from Day 1)\nIf on EBM, when volume reaches 75 mls/kg/day: add HMF.\n• Term infants: allow feeding on demand.\nWhen to stop HMF or Preterm Formula?\n• Consider changing preterm to standard formula and stop adding HMF \nto EBM when babies are breastfeeding on demand or have reached their \nexpected growth curve.\n• Preterm with poor weight gain can be given specially formulated post  \ndischarge formula for preterm infants. Preterm formula meant for \nnewborn preterm infants should not be given to infants > 2 months \npost conceptual age in view of potential Vitamin A and D toxicity.\nVitamin and mineral supplementation \n• Vitamins : a premature infant’s daily breast milk/ breast milk substitute \nintake will not supply the daily vitamin requirement. Multivitamin drop \nproviding Vitamin D 400 IU per day can be given after day 14 of life when \non feeding of 150 mls/kg/day. The supplement is continued for 3-4 months \npost discharge.\n• Iron:  Premature infants have reduced intra uterine iron accumulation \nand can become rapidly depleted of iron when active erythropoiesis \nresumes. Therefore babies of birth weight < 2000g should receive iron \nsupplements. Iron is given at a dose of 3 mg/kg elemental iron per day. \n• Ferric Ammonium Citrate (400mg/5mls) contains 86 mg/5 mls of \n   elemental iron.\n• Start on day 28, continue until 3-4 months post discharge or until review\n• Babies who have received multiple blood transfusions may not require \n   as much iron supplementation.\nSpecial Cases\n• IUGR babies with reversed end-diastolic flow on antenatal Doppler: \nStudies have show that these babies are at risk of NEC.

This is \nbecause thresholds for specific brain responses to hypoglycaemia occur over \na range of glucose levels, and these thresholds can be affected by alternative \nfuels such as ketone bodies, and by recent antecedent hypoglycaemia. \n• Neonatal glucose concentrations decrease after birth, to as low as \n30 mg/dL (1.7 mmol/dL) during the first 1 to 2 hours after birth, and then \nincrease to higher and relatively more stable concentrations, generally above \n45 mg/dL (2.5 mmol/L) by 12 hours after birth. \nTarget  Plasma Glucose Level\nClinical hypoglycemia is defined as a plasma glucose concentration low enough \nto cause symptoms and/or signs of impaired brain function. \n• Target plasma glucose for neonates remains controversial but is commonly \naccepted as plasma glucose level > 2.6mmol/L in a term or preterm infant.\n• In term infants < 4 hours old, plasma glucose > 1.5mmol/L is acceptable if \nthe infant is well, asymptomatic and tolerating feeds and repeat\nglucose is > 2.6 mmol/L.\n• For infants > 48 hours old, it is recommended to keep plasma glucose level \n> 3.3mmol/L to be above the threshold for neuroglycopaenic symptoms\n• For infants with suspected congenital hypoglycaemia disorder or \nsymptomatic infants, to keep plasma glucose  > 3.9mmol/L. \nA higher target level is chosen because of lack of alternative fuels and the \nrisks of undertreatment outweigh the risks of overtreatment.\nWhen Neonatal Hypoglycaemia is suspected, the plasma or blood glucose \nconcentration must be determined immediately. Plasma glucose values \n(RBS) tend to be 10% - 18% higher than whole blood values (Glucometer/\nDextrostix) because of the higher water content of plasma.\nScreening\nBlood glucose concentration should only be measured in term babies with \nclinical manifestations, or who are known to be at risk of hypoglycaemia\nInfants who are at increased risk of hypoglycemia and require glucose screening:\n• Symptoms of hypoglycemia\n• Large for gestational age (even without maternal diabetes)\n• Perinatal stress\n• Birth asphyxia/ischemia; caesarean delivery for fetal distress\n• Maternal preeclampsia/eclampsia or hypertension\n• Intrauterine growth restriction (small for gestational age)\n• Meconium aspiration syndrome, erythroblastosis fetalis, polycythemia, \n   hypothermia\n• Premature ( including late preterm infants) or postmature delivery\n• Family history of a genetic form of hypoglycemia\n• Congenital syndromes (eg, Beckwith-Wiedemann), abnormal physical \nfeatures (eg, midline facial malformations, microphallus)NEONATALOGY"

A white or “blanched” appearing extremity is an indication for \n    IMMEDIATE removal of the catheter.\n• Other risk factors contributing to thrombosis includes dehydration, sepsis, \n    and polycythaemia.

Oxygen saturation in the lower limb is 5-10% \nlower than right upper limb.\n• Labile hypoxaemia with marked change in oxygen saturation with \nminimal or no change in settings of ventilator due to changes in the \nvolume of R to L shunt. \nClassification\n• Underdevelopment : hypoplastic vasculature  e.g. congenital diaphragmatic \nhernia, pulmonary hypoplasia in oligohydramnios secondary to renal \ndisease or chronic leakage of amniotic fluid. \n• Maldevelopment : normal lung with remodeled pulmonary vasculature \nas in idiopathic PPHN, chronic fetal hypoxia\n• Maladaptation : parenchymal lung diseases e.g. Meconium Aspiration \nSyndrome (MAS), Pneumonia/sepsis, Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS), \nasphyxia\n• Intrinsic Obstruction : polycythaemia with intravascular obstruction and \nincrease PVR.\nDiagnosis\n• PPHN is clinically suspected in near term or term infants who have \nvariable oxygen saturation. \n• Physical Examination -  some of the infants may have signs of respiratory \ndistress. Single loud second heart sound.  \n• Differential pre and post ductal oxygen saturation (between 5-10%). \nLack of differential does not preclude PPHN. \n• ABG – Hypoxaemia disproportional to degree of lung disease. \n• 2D Echocardiography with colour flow doppler confirm diagnosis with \nright to left shunting at PFO and PDA.\n• Hyperoxia test if no 2D Echo available: PaO 2>150 mmhg in 100% FiO 2 \nfor 5-10 min excludes most CHD. A PaO 2 < 150 mmhg doesn’t exclude CHD \nor PPHN.\n• Chest x-ray – evidence of underlying parenchymal disease eg MAS, RDS, \npneumonia. Oligaemic lung fields in idiopathic PPHN.\n• FBC with differential to evaluate for high hematocrit level (polycythaemia) \nand risk of underlying infection.NEONATALOGY"

        "text": "165NEONATOLOGY Differential Diagnosis\n• Differentiating PPHN from cyanotic heart disease soon after admission is \nimportant. \n• Preductal and postductal oxygen saturations of more than 5-10% or PaO 2 \ndifferences of 10-20 mmHg between right upper limb and lower limbs \nhelps to differentiate PPHN from structural heart disease. \n• The diagnosis is confirmed with 2D Echocardiography which may not be \navailable in all hospitals. \nManagement\nPPHN management involves restoration of the cardiopulmonary adaptation \nand to minimise ventilator- and oxygen-induced pulmonary injury. \nThis includes treatment of the underlying disease, maintenance of normal \nsystemic BP , decrease pulmonary vascular resistance and ensure adequate \ntissue oxygenation.\n• Supportive care – \n• Maintain normothermia, correct metabolic and hematologic abnormali -\nties e.g. hypoglycemia, hypocalcaemia, polycythaemia and acidosis\n• Minimal stimulation\n• Sedation may be necessary to avoid agitation and asynchrony with \n   ventilator support; morphine infusion 10-20 mcg/kg/hr. \n• In systemic hypotension, a fluid bolus of 10ml/kg of normal saline \n   followed by dopamine 5-20 mcg/kg/min or noradrenaline of \n   0.05 – 1 mcg/kg/min. Noradrenaline may improve lung function in \n   PPHN through a decrease in pulmonary/systemic pressure ratio and  \n   improved cardiac performance.\n• Mechanical ventilation\n• Conventional “ gentle” ventilation strategies with optimal PEEP and \n   relatively low PIP or tidal volume (tv) for adequate lung expansion and \n   limit volutrauma or barotrauma. \n• Switch to HFOV If high PIP and high TV are required to maintain \n   PaCO 2 < 60 mmHg. \n• Target PaO 2 55-80 mmHg, PaCO 2 40-60 mmHg and pH 7.30-7.45.\n• Surfactant therapy improves oxygenation in PPHN secondary to \nparenchymal lung disease - RDS, MAS and pneumonia\n• Inhaled Nitric Oxide\n• Potent vasodilator and selectively dilates the pulmonary circulation \n   without decreasing systemic BP . \n• Initiation of iNO for severe PPHN with oxygenation index (OI) > 15-25 \n   at 20 ppm. \n• Wean iNO gradually to prevent rebound pulmonary vasoconstriction.\n• Wean FiO 2 first to below 60% and if PaO 2 can be maintained then wean \n   iNO by 5 ppm every 4 hours. Once iNO is 5 ppm, wean by 1 ppm every\n   4 hours."

Mortality can be as high as 20% since these infants have \nnot acquired maternal protecting antibodies. Cause of death is due to \nsevere pulmonary disease or widespread necrotic lesions of viscera.\n• When maternal varicella occurs 7-21 days before delivery, lesions typically \nappear in the first 4 days of life and prognosis is good with no associated \nmortality.  The mild course is probably due to the production and transpla -\ncental passage of maternal antibodies that modify the course of illness in \nnewborns. \n• Infants born to mothers who develop varicella between 7 days before \ndelivery or 7 days after delivery should receive as prophylaxis\n• Varicella Zoster immunoglobulin (VZIG) 125 IU i/m  as soon as possible \n   after delivery or within 96 hours of initial exposure (to reduce the \n   occurrence of complications and fatal outcomes). Attenuation of disease \n   might still be achieved with administration of VariZIGTM up to 10 days \n   after exposure.  \n• For infants born to mothers who develop varicella between 5 days  \n   before and 2 days post delivery,  add IV acyclovir 15 mg/kg/dose over \n   1 hour every 8hrly (total 45 mg/kg/day)  for 5 days. \n• If Zoster immunoglobulin is not available give \n   IV Immunoglobulin 400 mg/kg ( this is less effective)  AND \n   IV Acyclovir 15 mg/kg/dose over 1 hour every 8hrly (total 45 mg /kg/day)  \n   for 5 days. \n• On sending home, warn parents to look out for new vesicles or baby \n   being unwell, for 28 days after exposure. If so, parents to bring the  \n   infant to the nearest hospital as soon as possible (62% of healthy such \n   neonates given VZIG after birth) \n• If vesicles develop, give Acyclovir 15 mg/kg/dose over 1 hour every \n8hrly (total 30-45 mg /kg/day)  for 7-10 days. \n• Women with varicella at time of delivery should be isolated from their \nnewborns, breast-feeding is contraindicated.  The newborn baby can \nreceive expressed breast milk in the meantime and breast-feeding \ncommenced when all the mother’s lesions have crusted. \n• Neonates with varicella lesions should be isolated from other infants but \nnot from their mothers. \n• It has been generally accepted that passive immunization of the neonate \ncan modify the clinical course of neonatal varicella but it does not prevent \nthe disease and, although decreased, the risk of death is not completely \neliminated \n• Infants whose mothers develop Zoster before or after delivery have \nmaternal antibodies and they will not need VZIG.\n• Recommend immunisation of family members who are not immune.NEONATOLOGY"

Influenza, Klebsiella pneumonia and E. coli .  \n • Give IV antibiotics  until child shows signs of improvement.\n • Total antibiotics course duration of 3 to 4 weeks.\n • Most  pneumatocoeles  disappear,  with radiological evidence resolving  \n    within the first two months but may take as long as 6 months.\nSupportive treatment\n • Fluids  \n    • Withhold oral intake when a child is in severe respiratory distress. \n    • In severe pneumonia, secretion of anti-diuretic hormone is increased and\n       as such dehydration is uncommon. Avoid overhydrating the child.\n • Oxygen  \n    • Oxygen reduces mortality associated with severe pneumonia. \n    • It should be given especially to children who are restless, and tachypnoeic \n       with severe chest indrawing, cyanosis, or is not tolerating feeds. \n    • Maintain the SpO₂ > 95%.\n • Cough medication\n    • Not recommended as it causes suppression of cough and may interfere \n       with airway clearance. Adverse effects and overdosage have been reported.\n • Temperature control\n    • Reduces discomfort from symptoms, as paracetamol will not abolish fever.\n • Chest physiotherapy\n    • This assists in the removal of tracheobronchial secretions: removes airway \n        obstruction, increase gas exchange and reduce the work of breathing. \n    • No evidence that chest physiotherapy should be routinely done. \nOUTPATIENT MANAGEMENT\n • In children with mild pneumonia, their breathing is fast but there is no chest \n    indrawing.\n • Oral antibiotics can be prescribed.  \n • Educate parents/caregivers about management of fever, preventing \n    dehydration and identifying signs of deterioration.\n • The child should return in two days for reassessment, or earlier if the condition \n     is getting worse."

Simple \n                clear exudative fluid \nStage 2: FIBROPURULENT (7-10 days): Complicated pleural effusion or \n                pus fluid. Deposition of fibrin clots or fibrin membr ane. \n                May have septation or loculation.\nStage 3: ORGANIZING (2-4 weeks): Fibroblast grows on parietal and \n                pleural surface. Intra-pleural fibrin membrane transform to web \n                of thick and non-elastic pleural peel. \nManagement of Empyema Thoracis \nThe principle of management involves appropriate and adequate anti-microbial \ntherapy, pleural fluid drainage and supportive care which include oxygen \ntherapy, fluid and nutritional management.\n• The anti-microbial of choice is Penicillin or Cephalosporins like Cefuroxime \nand Ceftriaxone. In young children, Cloxacillin may be considered for \nStaphylococus infection. Carbapenem may be considered in cases not \nresponding to Penicillin or Cephalosporins. Parenteral administration of \nanti-microbial is essential during initial phase of anti- microbial therapy. \nHowever, the total duration of therapy including oral therapy varies from \n3-6 weeks determined by the severity of each case.\n• Pleural drainage with Intra-pleural fibrinolytic agent therapy\nPleural drainage with Intrapleural fibrinolytic agent therapy (Urokinase or \nStreptokinase)\n• Used in late Stage 1 or early Stage 2: facilitates drainage of fluid, reduces \nlength of hospital stay and avoids surgical intervention in some children. \n• Not beneficial in advanced stage like Stage 3. \n• Complications of intrapleural fibrinolytic therapy are uncommon: \n• fever, haemorrhage, pain and allergic reaction\n• generally safe when used cautiously\n• Contraindicated in haemothorax, pneumothorax and hypersensitive to \nintra-pleural fibrinolytic agents.

Choose most appropriate drug based on \nepilepsy syndrome, seizure type (if epilepsy syndrome not identified yet) \nand associated comorbidities. \n• Increase dose gradually until seizures controlled or maximum dose \nreached or side effects occur.\n• Add on the second drug if first drug failed. Optimise second drug, then \ntry to withdraw first drug. (Alternative monotherapy).\n• Rational combination therapy (usually 2 or maximum 3 drugs) \ni.e. combines drugs with different mechanism of action and consider their \nspectrum of efficacy, drug interactions and adverse effects.\n• Beware of AED-induced seizure aggravation in certain epilepsy syndromes.\n• Trial of vitamins and co-factors such as vitamin B6, pyridoxal phosphate, \nbiotin and folinic acid should be considered in infantile epilepsies not \nresponding to AED. \n• In children not responding to treatment with 2 AEDs, complete \nre-evaluation is required for epilepsy surgery / trial of ketogenic diet.\n• Risk of carbamazepine-induced hypersensitivity reactions, including \nSteven-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis, is increased in \npatients with the HLA-B*1502 allele – consider testing if test easily available. \n• Avoid starting female of childbearing potential with sodium valproate \nbecause of risk of teratogenicity and neurodevelopmental impairment to the \nunborn child, unless other treatments are ineffective or not tolerated.\n• Drug level monitoring is not routinely done (except phenytoin), unless \nnon- compliance, toxicity or drug interaction is suspected.\n• Vitamin D supplementation should be considered for children with risk\nfactors for Vitamin D deficiency, i.e. those on long term AED therapy, on \nmore than 1 AED and poor sunlight exposure.\n• When withdrawal of medication is planned (generally after being seizure-\nfree for 2 years) , consideration should be given to epilepsy syndrome, likely \nprognosis and individual circumstances before attempting slow withdrawal \nof medication over 3-6 months (maybe longer if using clonazepam or \nphenobarbitone). \nIf seizures recur, the last dose reduction is reversed and medical advice \nsought."

A person certified to be brain dead is dead. \nIt is a clinical diagnosis based on the absence of neurologic function with a \nknown irreversible cause of coma.\nDiagnosis of brain death (All to be fulfilled)\nPreconditions:\n• Patient is in deep coma, apnoeic and on ventilator.\n• Cause of coma fully established and sufficient to explain the status of patient.\n• There is irremediable / irreversible brain damage.\n• Normotensive for age without volume depletion (systolic BP and MAP in         \nacceptable range for not less than 2 SDs below age appropriate norm).\n• Core body temperature >35oC. \n• Corrected / treated metabolic disturbances.\n• Discontinuation and adequate clearance / elimination of medications \nthat can interfere with the neurologic examination and apnoea test.\nExclusions:\n• Preterm neonates < 37 weeks of gestational age.\n• Coma due to metabolic or endocrine disturbance, drug intoxication.\nDiagnostic Criteria  (All to be fulfilled)  \n• Deep coma, unresponsive and unreceptive, Glasgow scale 3/15.\n• Apnoeic, confirmed by apnoea test.\n• Absent brain stem reflexes confirmed by the following tests:-\n    1. Pupillary light reflex.\n    2. Oculocephalic reflex.  \n    3. Motor response in cranial nerve distribution\n    4. Corneal reflex\n    5. Vestibulo-ocular reflex (caloric test)\n    6. Oro-pharygeal reflex\n    7. Tracheo-bronchial reflex\nTest\n(All conditions and exclusions fulfilled before proceeding to examine and test \nfor brain death)\n 1. Pupillary light reflex .\n• Mid-position or dilated.\n• No response to bright light in both eyes.\n 2. Oculocephalic reflex . (Doll’s eye response) \n• Testing is done only when no fracture or instability of the cervical spine \nis apparent.\n• The oculocephalic response is elicited by fast, vigorous turning of the \nhead from middle position to 90o on both sides.NEUROLOGY"

Ideally, venous TSH levels should be \nbetween 0.5-2.0 mIU/L after the first month of life.\n• Venous fT4 levels usually normalise within 1-2 weeks, and TSH usually \nbecome normal after 1 month of treatment.\n• Some infants continue to have high venous TSH concentration (10-20 mIU/L) \ndespite normal venous fT4 values due to resetting of the pituitary-thyroid \nfeedback threshold. However, compliance to medication has to be \nreassessed and emphasised.\nCongenital malformations and syndromes should be systematically sought for \nin infants with congenital hypothyroidism. A thorough physical examination \nshould be carried out in all neonates with high TSH concentrations for the \ndetection of congenital malformations, particularly those affecting the heart, \nand in children for the identification of any underlying dysmorphic syndrome \nor neuro-developmental disorders. \nFollow-up\n• Monitor growth parameters and developmental assessment (special \nemphasis on hearing and speech). Ideally, repeated hearing tests should \nbe carried out before school age and as required (even though newborn \nhearing screening  tests has been done).\n• Patient (and serum fT4 and TSH) needs to be monitored according to the \nfollowing schedule: -\n• Age 1 month: Follow up 1-2 weekly until TSH levels normalised \n• Age 1-6 months: Follow up 1-2 monthly\n• Age 6 months - 3 years: Follow up 3-4 monthly\n• Age >3 years: Follow up 6-12 monthly \n• Should be more frequent if compliance is questionable or abnormal TFT \nvalues, and 4-6 weeks after any change in L-thyroxine dose/formulation. \n• Ongoing counselling of parents is important because of the serious \nconsequences of poor compliance.\nRe-evaluation of patients likely having transient hypothyroidism\n• This is best done at age 3 years when thyroid dependent brain growth is \ncompleted at this age. \n• Stop L-thyroxine for 4 weeks then repeat thyroid function test: fT4, TSH.\n• If the fT4 is low and the TSH value is elevated, permanent primary \nhypothyroidism is confirmed and imaging studies (thyroid scan, Ultrasound \nof the thyroid) should be considered to determine the specific aetiology. \nThus lifelong treatment is needed.\n*Re-evaluation may be considered earlier than 3 years old if the patient is on \n  very low dose of L-thyroxine (e.g. 12.5 mcg OD) while thyroid function tests \n  suggests over-treatment (i.e. TSH suppressed) and eutopic thyroid gland. \n  Re-evaluation may be waived in those with frequently raised TSH (>10 mIU/L)  \n  after the first year of life or already known absent or ectopic thyroid gland.ENDOCRINOLOGY"

Subsequent rehydrating fluids should contain \n0.45 – 0.9% NaCl according to serum sodium levels (with appropriate \ndextrose concentration in maintenance fluid). \n• Administer IV hydrocortisone 100 mg/m2 stat followed by 25 mg/m2 \nsix hourly during the acute condition.\n• If hypoglycaemia is present, correct with 2 ml/kg of dextrose 10% .\n• Continuous cardiac monitoring for hyperkalemic changes, and if necessary \nsevere symptomatic hyperkalemia needs to be corrected urgently (such as \nresonium, nebulized salbutamol or even glucose and insulin).\n• Monitor fluid input and output, vital signs, glucose level, serial serum \nelectrolytes and daily weight.\nTreatment of CAH\n• The aims of steroid therapy is to replace the adrenal cortisol production \nand also to suppress abnormal product (adrenal androgens) formation. \n• Oral hydrocortisone should be given in 3 divided doses, in the range of \n11-15 mg/m2/day or more to suppress excess adrenal androgen production. \nDuring infancy, a higher dose of hydrocortisone up to 25 mg/m² /day may be \nneeded due to markedly elevated adrenal androgens. Divided or crushed \ntablets of hydrocortisone should be used instead of syrup. \n• Excessive steroid doses may cause growth suppression and Cushingoid \nfeatures and therefore should be avoided. \n• Hydrocortisone is the preferred choice of glucocorticoid  replacement, \nespecially in infants and growing children.

If none, then the child \nprobably has idiopathic nephrotic syndrome.\nGeneral management \n• A normal protein diet with adequate calories is recommended. \n• No added salt to the diet when child has oedema.\n• Penicillin V 125 mg BD (1-5 years age), 250 mg BD (6-12 years), 500 mg BD \n(> 12 years) is recommended at diagnosis and during relapses, \nparticularly in the presence of gross oedema.\n• Careful assessment of the haemodynamic status. \n• Check for signs and symptoms which may indicate\n   - Hypovolaemia:  Abdominal pain, cold peripheries, poor capillary refill, \n       poor pulse volume with or without low blood pressure; OR\n   - Hypervolaemia:  Basal lung crepitations, rhonchi, hepatomegaly, \n       hypertension.\n• Fluid restriction - not recommended except in chronic oedematous states.\n• Diuretics (e.g. frusemide) are not necessary in steroid responsive nephrotic \nsyndrome but use with caution if required, as may precipitate hypovolaemia.\n•  Human albumin (20-25%) at 0.5 - 1.0 g/kg can be used in symptomatic \n grossly oedematous states together with IV frusemide at 1-2 mg/kg to \n produce a diuresis. \nCaution: fluid overload and pulmonary oedema can occur with albumin \ninfusion especially in those with impaired renal function. Urine output and \nblood pressure should be closely monitored.\nGeneral advice\n• Counsel patient and parents about the disease particularly with regards \nto the high probability (85-95%) of relapse.\n• Home urine albumin monitoring: once daily dipstix testing of the first \nmorning urine specimen. The patient is advised to consult the doctor if \nalbuminuria ≥ 2+ for 3 consecutive days, or 3 out of 7 days.\n• The child is also advised to consult the doctor should he/she become \noedematous regardless of the urine dipstix result.\n• Children on systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents \nshould be advised and cautioned about contact with chickenpox and \nmeasles, and if exposed should be treated like any immunocompromised \nchild who has come into contact with these diseases.\n• Immunisation:\n•  While the child is on corticosteroid treatment and within 6 weeks after its \n   cessation, only killed vaccines may safely be administered to the child. \n• Give live vaccines 6 weeks after cessation of corticosteroid therapy.\n• Pneumococcal vaccine should be administered to all children with \n  nephrotic syndrome.

Common presenting symptoms \nare pallor, lethargy, failure to thrive and hepatosplenomegaly. \n• Most of the population are unaware of their carrier status. \n• Carrier rates of thalassaemia gene in Malaysia: \n• β-thalassaemia   : 3 - 5%\n• α-thalassaemia   : 1.8 - 7.5%      \n• Haemoglobin E (HbE)  : 5 - 46%\n• HbE carriers are mainly in the northern peninsular states. \n• Interaction between a β-thal carrier with an HbE carrier may result in \nthe birth of a patient with HbE/β-thalassaemia or thalassaemia intermedia \nwith variable clinical severity. The moderate to severe forms behave like \nβ-thalassaemia major patients while the milder forms are asymptomatic.\nBaseline investigations to be done for ALL new patients: -\n• Full blood count (In typical cases, the Hb is usually below  7g/dl)\n• Peripheral blood film \n• Mandatory:  Haemoglobin analysis by electrophoresis or \n                      HPLC (High-performance liquid chromatography)\nTypical findings for β-thalassaemia major: \nHbA decreased or absent, HbF increased, HbA2 variable\nOther pointers\n• Red cell phenotyping (required) before first transfusion. This test is not  \nuseful if the patient has been transfused in the last 3 months\n• DNA analysis \n• Mandatory in prenatal diagnosis\n• Available upon request at tertiary centre labs in IMR, HKL, HUKM, UMMC \nand USM\n• β gene analysis done in IMR and α gene analysis in HKL- these tests \nrequire a special form and consent \n• Infection screen: HIV, Hepatitis B & C, VDRL screen (before first \ntransfusion).\n• All nuclear family members must be investigated by Hb Analysis for \ngenetic counselling.\n• 1st degree and 2nd degree relatives is encouraged to be screened and \ncounselled (cascade screening).HAEMATO-ONCOLOGY"

Avoid overeating\n• Lifestyle changes. \n• Dietary t reatment \n   - Use of a thickened formula (or commercial anti regurgitation formulae)  \n     may decrease visible regurgitation but does not reduce in the frequency \n     of oesophageal reflux episodes.\n  - There may be association between cow’s milk protein allergy and GERD.   \n  - Therefore infants with GERD that are refractory to conventional anti \n    reflux therapy may benefit  from a 2- to 4-week trial of elimination of \n    cow’s milk in diet with an extensively hydrolyzed protein formula that \n    has been evaluated in controlled trials. Locally available formulas are \n    Alimentum, Pepti and Pregestimil. Usually there will be strong family \n    history of atopy in these patients.     \n - No evidence to support the routine elimination of any specific food in \n   older children with GERD.\n• Position during sleep\n - Prone positioning decreases the amount of acid oesophageal exposure \n   measured by pH probe compared with that measured in the supine \n   position. However, prone and lateral positions are associated with an \n   increased incidence of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). \n   Therefore, in most infants from birth to 12months of age, supine \n   positioning during sleep is recommended.\n - Prone or left-side sleeping position and/or elevation of the head of the \n   bed for adolescents with GERD may be of benefit in select cases.\n• Buffering agents (some efficacy in moderate GERD, relatively safe). \nAntacids only in older children.\n• Buffering agents e.g. alginate and sucralfate are useful on demand for \n   occasional heartburn. \n• Chronic use of buffering agents is not recommended for GERD because \n   some have absorbable components that may have adverse effects with \n   long-term use.\n• Prokinetics . \n• Treat pathophysiologic mechanism of GERD.\n• There i s insufficient evidence of clinical efficacy to justify the routine \n   use of metoclopramide, erythromycin, or domperidone for GERD."

It is important to understand that vital signs are \ndynamic and prone to be confounding.

Symptoms include fever, cough, \nweight loss, night sweats, respiratory distress.\n• Extrapulmonary disease may manifest as prolonged fever, apathy, weight \nloss, enlarged lymph nodes (cervical, supraclavicular, axillary), headache, \nvomiting, increasing drowsiness, infants may stop vocalising. Swellings and \nloss of function may suggest bone, joint or spinal TB.\n• Phlyctenular conjuctivitis, erythema nodosum and pleural effusions are \nconsidered hypersensitivity reactions of TB disease.  \nDiagnosis of TB disease\nDiagnosis in children is usually difficult. Features suggestive of tuberculosis are:\n• Recent contact with a person (usually adult) with active tuberculosis. \nThis constitutes one of the strongest evidence of TB in a child who has \nsymptoms and x ray abnormalities suggestive of TB.\n• Symptoms and signs suggestive of TB  are as listed above. Infants are \nmore likely to have non specific symptoms like low-grade fever, cough, \nweight loss, failure to thrive, and signs like wheezing, reduced breath \nsounds, tachypnoea and occasionally frank respiratory distress.\n• Positive Mantoux test (>10 mm induration at 72 hours; tuberculin \nstrength of 10  IU PPD).\n• Suggestive chest X-ray:\n• Enlarged hilar Iymph nodes +/-  localised obstructive emphysema\n• Persistent segmental collapse consolidation not responding to \n   conventional antibiotics.\n• Pleural effusion.\n• Calcification in Iymph nodes - usually develops > 6 mths after infection.\n• Laboratory tests\n• Presence of AFB on smears of clinical specimens and positive \n   histopathology or cytopathology on tissue specimens are highly \n   suggestive of TB.  Isolation of M. tuberculosis  by culture from \n   appropriate specimens is confirmatory.\nDiagnostic Work-up\n• Efforts should be made to collect clinical specimens for AFB smear, \ncytopathology or histopathology, special stains and AFB culture to \nassure confirmation of diagnosis and drug susceptibility.\n• If the source case is known, it is important to utilize information from the\nsource such as culture and susceptibility results to help guide therapy.\n• The diagnostic work-up for TB disease is tailored to the organ system \nmost likely affected."

        "text": "555Chapter 98:  Appendicitis\nAppendicitis is the most common surgical condition of the abdomen in \nchildren over the age of 4 years and yet can be a challenge to diagnose and \nmanage. Although diagnosis and treatment have improved over the years, it \ncontinues to cause considerable morbidity and even mortality in Malaysia. \nThe deaths appear to be due to delay and difficulty in diagnosis, inadequate \nperioperative fluid replacement and sepsis.\nClinical Features\n• Abdominal pain – Lower abdominal pain is an early and almost invariable \nfeature. Usually the pain starts in the epigastrium or periumbilical region \nbefore localising to the lower abdomen or the right iliac fossa. However \nthe younger child may not be able to localise the pain. If there is free pus, \nthe pain is generalised.\n• Nausea and vomiting  occurs in about 90% of children and is an early symptom. \nMost children have a loss of appetite. A hungry child rarely has appendicitis. \n• Diarrhoea  is more common in the younger age group causing confusion \nwith gastroenteritis. It can also be due to pelvic appendicitis or collection \nof pus within the pelvis. \n• Dysuria and frequency  are also commonly present in the child with pelvic \nappendicitis or perforated appendicitis.\nPhysical Findings\n• General  – the child is usually quiet  and may be dehydrated.\n• Dehydration  must be actively sought for especially in the obese child and \nthe child with perforated appendicitis. A history of vomiting and diarrhoea, \ntachycardia, poor urine output and poor perfusion of the peripheries are \nindicators of dehydration.\n• Tenderness  on palpation or percussion is essential for the diagnosis. \nIt may be localised to the right iliac fossa or be generalised. The tender -\nness may  also be mild initially and difficult to elicit in the obese child or \nif the appendix is retrocaecal. Eliciting rebound tenderness is usually not \nrequired to make the diagnosis and can cause unnecessary discomfort.\n• Guarding  signifies peritonitis but may be subtle especially if the child is \ntoxic, obese and very dehydrated. \n• Rectal examination is only required if other diagnosis are suspected e.g. \novarian or adnexal pathology.\nInvestigations\n• Full blood count – The total white blood cell count may be elevated but a \nnormal count does not exclude appendicitis.\n• Blood Urea and Serum Electrolytes – The sodium level may be apparently \nnormal if the child is dehydrated.\n• Serum Amylase  – If pancreatitis cannot be ruled out as the cause of the \nabdominal pain.\n• Ultrasound  increases accuracy of diagnosis and can rule out other causes \nof pain but is dependent on the operator, patient habitus and cooperation.\n• CT scan with IV contrast - high degree of diagnostic accuracy but is \nassociated with high radiation risks and costs.PAEDIATRIC SURGERY"

        "text": "556• Therefore in our setting, the recommendation is that the child is assessed \nby a surgeon or a paediatrician preoperatively before further imaging.\n•  If the diagnosis cannot be made with certainty or the child is very ill and \nthere are no facilities or personnel for intensive care, the child must be \nreferred to the nearest paediatric surgical unit.\nComplications\n• Perforation  can occur within 36 hours of the onset of symptoms. \nPerforation rate increases with the duration of symptoms and delayed \npresentation is an important factor in determining perforation rate.\n                  Perforation rate: Adolescent age group - 30-40% \n                                                 Younger child - up to about 70%. \nIf unsure of the diagnosis, active observation with adequate fluid \nresuscitation can be done. Antibiotics are to be started once the diagnosis \nis made. This has not been shown to increase the morbidity or mortality.\nDelaying surgery till daytime, while resuscitating and giving antibiotics also \ndoes not significantly affect the perforation rate, complications or operating \ntime. \n• Appendicular abscess , mass and perforation may be treated with IV antibiotics \nto settle the inflammatory and infectious process. If the child settles, this can \nthen be followed by an  interval appendicectomy, done within 6 weeks of the \noriginal disease, as the rate of recurrent appendicitis is between 10-46%.\nManagement\n• Children with appendicitis (suspected or confirmed) should be reviewed \nby a specialist. \n• Dehydration should be actively looked for. The heart rate, blood \npressure, perfusion and the urine output should be closely monitored. \nThe blood pressure is usually maintained in the children until they have \ndecompensated.\n• Rehydration must be aggressive, using 20 mls/kg aliquots of normal \nsaline or Hartmann’s solution (Ringer’s lactate) given fast over ½ - 2 hours. \nThe child should be reviewed after each bolus and the rehydration contin -\nued until the child’s heart rate, perfusion and urine output and electrolytes \nare within normal limits. Maintenance fluid – ½ saline + 5% D/W + KCl.\n• Antibiotics should be started soon after the diagnosis is made. While the \npreliminary literature for non-operative management of UNCOMPLICATED \nappendicitis is increasing, patient selection criteria are still unclear \nespecially if the diagnosis cannot be made with certainty on ultrasound. \n• However, operation is recommended in the child with perforated appendicitis. \n• Inotropes may need to be started early if the child is in severe sepsis.\n• Operation - There is no rush to take the child to the operating theatre. \nIt is recommended that appendicectomies not be performed after 11 pm, \nespecially in the sick child. However, the time should be utilised to continue \nthe resuscitation and antibiotics with close monitoring of the child.\n• At surgery, if there is free pus in the peritoneal cavity, a thorough peritoneal \nwashout with copious amount of normal saline is done after the appendicectomy. \nNo drains are required and the skin can be closed with a subcuticular suture.

Damage occurs in the first 6-12 months of \nlife.  90% of patients with orchidopexy before 2 years have satisfactory \nspermatogenesis. If done after >15 years old, fertility is 15%. Fertility is \nalso affected by ductal anomalies.\n• Testicular tumour: Risk is 22 times higher than the normal population \n(Intra-abdominal 6 times more than inguinal).  Surgery makes the testis \nmore accessible to palpation and thus an earlier diagnosis. \n• Associated hernias (up to 65%), urinary tract anomaly (3%, e.g. duplex, \nhorseshoe), anomalies of epididymis or vas deferens and intersex problems.\n• Psychological problems.\nManagement\n• Ask mother whether she has ever felt the testis in the scrotum, more \neasily felt during a warm bath and when squatting.\nExamine patient (older children can be asked to squat).  A normal sized \nscrotum may suggest a retractile testis. A retractile testis, once brought \ndown to the scrotum, can stay in the scrotum transiently. Surgery is usually \nnot required for the retractile testis.\n• The scrotum tends to be hypoplastic in true cryptorchidism.\n• If bilateral need to rule out dysmorphic syndromes, hypopituitarism, and \nchromosomal abnormalities (e.g. Klinefelter). Exclude intersex disorders.\n• Observe the child for the 1st year of life.  If the testis remains \nundescended after 1 year of life surgery is indicated.  Surgery should be \ndone between 6-18 months of age.  Results of hormonal therapy (HCG, \nLH-RH) have not been good. However, the use of gonadotropin releasing \nhormone as an adjuvant to orchidopexy appears to possibly improve germ \ncell maturation in child with bilateral non palpable testes.\n• A non-palpable testis may represent an inguinal testis that is difficult to \npalpate, an intra-abdominal testis, a vanishing testis or true tesiticular agenesis.\n• For bilateral impalpable testis: Management of choice is Laparoscopy \n± open surgery. Ultrasound, CT scan or MRI to locate the testes have not \nbeen shown to be useful.  Check chromosomes and 17 OH progesterone \nlevels if genitalia are ambiguous.     PAEDIATRIC SURGERY"

It has a membranous covering (Amnion, Wharton’s jelly, \nperitoneum) and the umbilical cord is usually attached to the apex of the \ndefect. The content of the large defect is usually liver and bowel but in the \nsmall defect the content may just be bowel loops.\nProblems\n• Fluid loss: Significant in gastroschisis due to the exposed loops of bowel.\n• Hypothermia: Due to the larger exposed surface area.\n• High incidence of associated syndromes and anomalies especially in \nexomphalos.\n• Hypoglycemia can occur in 50% of babies with Beckwith-Wiedermann’s \nSyndrome (exomphalos, macroglossia, gigantism).\nManagement \n• Evaluation: for hydration and associated syndromes and anomalies.\n• Fluids: IV fluids are essential as losses are tremendous especially from \nthe exposed bowel. Boluses (10-20 mls/kg) of normal saline, Sterofundin \nor colloids must be given frequently to keep up with the ongoing losses. \nA maintenance drip of ½ Saline + 10% D/W at 60 – 90 mls/kg (Day 1 of life) \nshould also be given. \n• Orogastric tube: Gastric decompression is essential here and a Size 8 Fr tube \nis inserted, aspirated 4 hourly and placed on free drainage.\n• Warmth: Pay particular attention to the temperature control. \nThe increased exposed surface area and the fluid exudation will cause \nthe baby to be wet and cold.  Wrapping the baby’s limbs with cotton and \nplastic will help.\n• Care of the exposed membranes: The bowel/membranes should be \nwrapped with a clean plastic film without compressing, twisting and kink -\ning the bowel. Please do NOT use “warm, saline soaked gauze” directly on \nthe bowel as the gauze will get cold and stick to the bowel/membranes. \n• Disposable diapers or cloth nappies changed frequently will help to \nkeep the child dry. \n• Monitoring: Heart rate, Capillary refill time, Urine output (the baby may \nneed to be catheterised to monitor urine output or have the nappies \nweighed).\n• Position: The baby should be placed in a lateral position to prevent \ntension and kinking of the bowel.\n• Referral to the surgeon as soon as possible.PAEDIATRIC SURGERY"

Need to balance the requirement versus side effects carefully aiming \nfor lowest possible dose to maintain disease control with the least side effects.\n• Can be given orally (Prednisolone) or intravenously (Methyl Prednisolone). \n• Initial does varies depending on severity of disease and extent of organs \ninvolved, Prednisolone: 0.5-2 mg/kg/day in at least 2 divided doses or IV \nMethylprednisolone 10-30mg/kg/day for 3-5 days, may be repeated up to \nweekly (max 1 gram, but generally not more than 500 mg/day as patients \nprone to infection/ sepsis)\n• Tapering of steroid dose should occur once disease is controlled aiming \nfor lowest possible dose. The rapidity of steroid taper depends on clinical \nresponse (resolution of symptoms and physical abnormalities), control of \ndisease activity and towards normalization of laboratory findings (e.g. no \ncytopenias, improving or near normal complement levels, reducing \nproteinuria, improving urinalysis, lowering of antidsDNA levels)\n• Generally, the higher the dose, the faster the taper. During active phase, \nwill require divided doses. Once daily dose usually not recommended till \n10 mg/day or less. Alternate day dosing may be inadequate to control ac -\ntive SLE despite lower risk of side effects.\nImmunosuppressive agents\n• Immunosuppressive agents are now started early soon after diagnosis \nfor rapid control of disease with improved long-term outcome and as a \nsteroid-sparing agent.\n• The choice of immunosuppressive agents is largely dictated by the organ \nsystem/s involved and the severity of involvement.\n• Azathioprine (1-2.5 mg/kg/day) is the most commonly used \nimmunosuppressive agent, especially for haematological, dermatological, \nserositis, vasculitis and sometimes as maintenance therapy for lupus \nnephritis. Generally well tolerated, side effects include nausea, \nGI symptoms, hair loss, bone marrow suppression.\n• Major organ involvement like renal, cerebral, cardiac and pulmonary or \nother life-threatening manifestations usually will warrant pulses of \nIV Cyclophosphamide together with generally a single pulse of \nIV Methylprednisolone at monthly intervals for minimum 6 months.\n• Cyclophosphamide (500-1000mg/m2/dose, max dose 1.2 g) is effective but \nassociated with significant risks of infection (immunosuppression), haemor -\nrhagic cystitis (prevented by Mesna), infertility and long term risk of cancer.\n• Mycophenolate mofetil (600-1200mg/m2/day): used for induction phase of \nlupus nephritis, but the cost precludes its use as first line. It is also used for \nvarious other significant manifestations including haematological, dermato -\nlogical and myositis.

        "text": "606Chapter 108:  Snake Bite\nIntroduction\n• Different geographical region and countries will have different snake \nspecies of medical importance. \n• Snakes of medical importance in Malaysia are either equipped with \nspecialised front fangs or without front fangs. The front-fanged snakes are \neither in the family Elapidae (cobras, kraits, coral snakes and sea snakes) or \nCrotalinae (Pit vipers). Pythons and some non-front fanged colubroids may \nalso pose danger to humans.\n• All front-fanged and a few rear-fanged snakes are equipped with venom.\n• Snake venoms are made of complex and diverse group of proteins, many \nwith enzymatic activity. Envenoming syndromes are treated with timely \nadministration of the appropriate antivenom in adequate amount\n• It is important to note that a medically important snake found in one \nstate in Malaysia may not be indigenous in another. Therefore, the \nrequirement for antivenom may differ from hospitals to hospitals in the \ncountry.\n• Early access to experts in the field (Clinical Toxinologist) will assist \nhealthcare providers in snake species identification and optimal \nmanagement, saving lives and limbs.\nNote: Assistance/query/consultation for identification and clinical \nmanagement of snakebite can be obtained from the National Poison Centre \nMalaysia and the Remote Envenomation Consultation Services (RECS) \nMalaysia (http://mstoxinology.blogspot.com/p/recs.html).\nClinical features of common snakebite envenoming\n• Local envenoming syndrome by cobra ( Naja ) species include immediate \npain, progressively worsening swelling, blistering and necrosis. Systemic \nenvenoming manifest as acute neurological and cardiac dysfunction \nincluding ptosis [an early sign], ophthalmoplegia, dysphagia [drooling of \nsaliva], aphasia, dyspnea, muscle paralysis and arrhythmias. \n• Krait ( Bungarus ) species bites may cause minimal local effects and may \ngo unnoticed. Systemic envenoming may be delayed and manifest as sud -\nden onset of rapidly progressive myalgia and muscle paralysis. \n• Sea snake bites cause minimal local effects. Systemic envenoming may \npresent as generalised myalgia, stiffness, paresis, paralysis and myoglo -\nbinuria (dark coloured urine). Rhabdomyolysis may lead to acute renal \nfailure. \n• Pit viper bite envenoming may cause progressively worsening pain and \nswelling, haemorrhagic blisters, necrosis, hypovolaemic shock from third \nspace fluid loss and bleeding due to coagulopathy. \nNote: These clinical features are the manifestations of various toxins in the \nvenom. Toxic venom components can vary even within the same snake \nspecies. The age, geographical distribution and prey specificity factors may \ninfluence the compositions of venom toxins.

Indications for PBI include 1) the snake is identified as \nkrait, coral snake or sea snake; 2) if the snake is unidentified, the transport \ntime to the hospital is prolonged (more than an hour).\n• If venom enters the eye (venom ophthalmia), immediately irrigate with \ncopious amounts of clean water. \n• Transfer all patients to the nearest healthcare facility with emergency care. \nNote: Document all symptoms and signs that may manifest prior to arrival to \nthe hospital. Do not interfere with the bitten area by applying tourniquet, \ndoing incisions, sucking, rubbing, vigorous cleaning, applying herbs/chemi -\ncals, massage or electrical shocks. Avoid wasting time to search or kill the \nsnake. Take several good quality pictures of the snake at a safe distance e.g. \nusing mobile phone camera. If the snake was killed, bring the it along in a \nsecure container. \nEmergency and Hospital \n• Triage to resuscitation zone and Perform rapid clinical assessment \n(Primary survey). \n• Monitor vital signs and cardiac rhythm, and resuscitate as indicated.\n• Obtain detailed history of presenting complaint: \n1) time of incident\n2) location of incident\n3) how exactly did the patient get bitten\n4) what happened to the snake\n5) part of body bitten\n6) what was done after bitten\n7) pain score progression (PSP) since incident\n8) current complaints \n9) allergy history (to horse or pa paya) and other co-morbidities\n• Perform close serial examination at fixed time intervals (every hour) for \nany changes over the bitten area (bite marks and surrounding skin), \nthe rate of proximal progression of the oedema (RPP), PSP , palpable ten -\nder lymph nodes draining the area, and distal neurovascular status of the \naffected limb.

Look for gentle chest rise \n(tidal volume) and bagged at 10 to 12 breaths per minute in a cardiac arrest \nchild with ongoing chest compressions (ratio of 2 ventilation to 15 chest \ncompression). In a seriously ill child with inadequate respiratory effort, \nventilate at a rate of 15 to 30 breaths per minute (faster rate in younger child).\n3. CHEST COMPRESSION\nStart IMMEDIATE chest compressions if\n• There are no signs of life.\n• There is no pulse.\n• There is a slow pulse (less than 60 beats per minute with poor perfusion).  \nThe cycles of 2 ventilations to 15 chest compression should be performed at \na rate of 5 to 6 cycles per minute for a total of two minutes whilst waiting for \nhelp to arrive.  \nThe chest should be compressed to one third the anterior-posterior diameter \nof the chest, about 4 cm for infant and 5 cm for a child.  \nThe cardiac arrest child receiving uninterrupted BLS should be connected to the \nECG monitor as soon as possible to ascertain whether it is an non-shockable \n(asystole or pulseless electrical activity) or shockable rhythm (ventricular fibrilla -\ntion or pulseless ventricular tachycardia).  Adrenaline should be given immediately \nto non-shockable rhythm and defibrillation performed on shockable rhythm.  \n4. BLOOD SAMPLING & VASCULAR ACCESS\n4.1.

Catheterise the umbilical artery to the\n desired position.  \n     The formula for UAC is: \n     • (Birth weight in kg x 3) + 9 + ‘stump length’ in cm  (read length from the upper \n    end of the stump) (high position: tip above diaphragm between T6-9 )\n     • Birth weight in kg + 7 cm ( low position is no longer recommended n)\n  3.

However, this pulsation may not be seen in very\n   preterm babies and babies in shock, using the closed system.\n• In accidental cannulation of the umbilical vein, the catheter tip can be in\nthe left atrium (via the foramen ovale from the right atrium into left \natrium) or in the left ventricle giving a backflow of oxygenated blood.\n• Stick the label of the catheter onto patient’s folder for future reference \n(brand and material of catheter) in the event of limb ischaemia or\nthrombosis of femoral artery occurring later.PROCEDURES"
