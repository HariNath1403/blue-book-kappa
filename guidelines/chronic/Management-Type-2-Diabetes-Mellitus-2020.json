This is even more important in the management of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). An optimum result can only be achieved with a holistic approach and active patient participation with the support of appropriate diabetes education and lifestyle modification. In addition to its negative impact on the quality of life and health care costs, diabetes also increases the economic burden of individuals, families and communities and, affects national productivity.\nI note that there has been a recent explosion of advances made in the \nmanagement of diabetic complications. The use of new technology and findings from landmark trials have changed clinical pathways and recommendations in the way T2DM is managed. This has been reflected in the latest Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) for the Management of T2DM (6\nth Edition). These guidelines \nalso focus on preventing and reducing diabetes-related complications, thereby improving clinical outcomes. This CPG will form a valuable resource for healthcare professionals from primary to tertiary care levels, to deliver the best possible care for their patients, from disease prevention to treatment of complications.\n In this networked age, we should no longer be working in silos and I would \nlike to reaffirm the importance and recognition of a multidisciplinary approach in managing T2DM. I have been a champion for embracing technology and innovation – and note that there is emphasis on the potential to use mobile apps and other forms of technological advances / telemedicine to improve diabetes self-management. The importance of this is even greater now in the context of the new norm forced on everyone by the Covid-19 pandemic.\nThe breadth and depth of material covered reflects the commitment and \nthe dedication of the CPG committee, despite the difficulties encountered during the Covid-19 pandemic. I would like to congratulate the chairs and the members for their hard work and it is my sincere wish that this document will further elevate the standard of diabetes care and reduce the burden of T2DM in our country.\nTan Sri Dato' Seri Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah"

        "text": "4\nFOREWORD\nby Chairpersons of T2DM Clinical Practice Guidelines, \n6th edition taskforce\nThese are exciting times for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) \nand a time for concern. The past 5 years have seen amazing breakthroughs that give hope for people with T2DM. Several Cardiovascular Outcome trials (CVOTs) from 2 new classes of glucose-lowering agents have shown cardiovascular (CV) protection, beyond glucose.\nOn the other hand, prevalence of diabetes in Malaysia continues to rise unabated. \nThe 2019 National Health and Morbidity Survey (NHMS) shows a prevalence of 18.3% (for adults >18 years of age), a 4% increase from 2015; 48.6% were undiagnosed. In addition, ~5.0% of our young Malaysians between 18-29 years are also diabetic. It is worrying to see this trend. The frequent co-existence with other well-known comorbidities, e.g. hypertension, dyslipidaemia, overweight/obesity further complicates the situation. \nThe 5\nth edition of our Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) for the Management of \nT2DM 2015, was detailed and comprehensive. Our aspiration was to build on \nthe previous CPG. Since then, there have been major advances; in therapeutics, nutrition, technology as well as, digital health. \nThe landmark CVOTs have consistently demonstrated positive beneficial CV \noutcomes in those with either established or at high risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Another exciting advance has been the discovery of a 2\nnd \ntherapeutic class of agent, apart from the renin-angiotensin system blockers, to directly reduce progression of diabetic kidney disease (DKD). DKD remains the largest contributor of new patients requiring dialysis in Malaysia and, recent renal outcome trials definitively show positive outcomes for prevention of progression to end-stage renal failure and reduction of albuminuria. More exciting data may be forthcoming with ongoing dedicated trials investigating effects of these glucose-lowering agents, on heart failure and prevention of kidney disease not only in people with diabetes but also, in nondiabetic individuals.\nThese results have led to paradigm shifts, changing practices as we move \nforward. The objective of these guidelines is to reflect the uptake of this new data in clinical decision making and therefore, provide evidence-based recommendations to assist healthcare providers in identifying, diagnosing and managing our patients with T2DM. Some of the other notable updates, include additional sections on current hot topics; e.g. non-alcoholic fatty liver disease"

The landmark CVOTs have been consolidated \nand summarised in Appendix 8.\nT2DM is not a stand-alone disease instead reaching across a spectrum of other \nnon-communicable diseases. Hence, in this updated guideline, we expanded our taskforce to include colleagues from other specialities; including nephrology, neurology, gastroenterology-hepatology, cardiology, ophthalmology, psychiatry and dental surgery. The committee hopes that this combination of expertise has enhanced the recommendations in this CPG to further improve clinical decision making. \nThe development of these guidelines extended into an extraordinary situation \ncaused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Through it, the hardworking committee members of the taskforce, including our reviewers, persevered with continuous and timely discussions to reach consensus where required through use of technology/remote communication, enabling its completion. To this, we extend our appreciation and gratitude, and commend their unwavering commitment to deliver the best evidence-based standard of care to our patients with T2DM.

Prediabetes is an important risk factor for future diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD). It is a potentially reversible condition with lifestyle modification.\n•\n T2DM is the most c\nommon form of diabetes mellitus, accounting for >90% of \nall cases of adult-onset diabetes mellitus in Malaysia. Both prediabetes and diabetes commonly coexist with other non-communicable diseases namely hypertension, dyslipidaemia and obesity.\n•\n With a high and increasing global, and local prevalence, T2DM represents a huge \nsocio-economic burden due to increased morbidity from accelerated \nvascular complications and premature death.\n•\n T2DM is charact\nerised by progressive decline in beta-cell function associated \nwith insulin resistance in muscle and adipose tissue.\n›\n The insulin resistant stat\ne results in increased hepatic glucose output and \nreduced utilisation of glucose by various organs contributing to fasting \nhyperglycaemia and between meal hyperglycaemia.\n›\n Impaired int\nestinal incretin secretion causes compromised meal-related \ninsulin secretion and glucagon suppression contributing to postprandial hyperglycaemia.\n›\n E\nxcessive renal tubular reabsorption of glucose further contributes to \nhyperglycaemia.\n•\n T2DM is an important \nrisk factor for CVD and microvascular complications \nsuch as nephropathy, retinopathy and neuropathy.

Provide brief advice on quit smoking at every visit to all smokers.\n3. Assess level of nicotine addiction using Modified Fagerström Test for Cigarette Dependence Questionnaire (COMPULSORY) and verify smoking status using carbon monoxide (CO) breath analyser (IF AVAILABLE).\n4. Offer pharmacotherapy to all smokers who are attempting to quit, unless contraindicated.\n5. If selected, use nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) for at least eight to twelve weeks, whereas varenicline should be used for at least twelve weeks.\n6. Combination therapy (e.g. two NRTs, a non-NRT, e.g. bupropion with an NRT) is better than monotherapy in smoking cessation treatment and may be most useful for those smokers at highest risk of relapse.\n7. Use smoking cessation medications with caution in special populations (e.g. children and adolescents, pregnant, breastfeeding women, psychiatric and substance abuse disorder patients).\n8. Arrange a minimum of six to eight face to face follow-up sessions for smoking cessation interventions in six months through counselling support team (health education officer, pharmacists or any officer trained for quit smoking services)."
