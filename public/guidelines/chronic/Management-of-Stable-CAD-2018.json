        "text": "2\nStable Coronary Artery Disease 2018\n(2nd Edition)\nMESSAGE FROM THE DIRECTOR GENERAL OF HEALTH\nThe previous clinical practice guidelines for the management \nof stable angina were issued in 2010. Since then, there have \nbeen advances in both diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in the \nmanagement of this progressive disease. Therefore, it is timely \nfor the publication of this CPG, with a title that is now evolved \nfrom stable angina to that of stable coronary artery disease (SCAD).\nAtherosclerosis is a systemic vascular disease, but it is in the \ncoronary arteries where this progressive disease exerts its \nmost serious effects which can significantly affect morbidity \nand mortality.\nClinical manifestation of SCAD, by means of stable angina, has long been the point \nwhereby an individual begins to seek medical attention. However, the combination of earlier screening by an increasingly greater number of the general population at risk of \ncoronary artery disease has seen more patients being diagnosed with the subclinical \nSCAD. The high prevalence of risk factors of cardiovascular disease in Malaysia, \nincluding diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidaemia and smoking, and the emergence of \nbetter diagnostic equipment have both contributed to this effect.\nIn both subclinical and clinically evident SCAD, there are now new drugs and non-drug \ninterventions available, which are now more readily available compared to when this \nlast CPG was published. In addition, new clinical evidence have emerged on these \nnew therapies. In this respect, the publication of this CPG, which reviews published research on these new therapies and strategies, is timely.\nThe management of SCAD has to be tailored carefully to an individual, as the right \ntherapeutic strategies often improves symptoms. This CPG reviews most available \ntreatment options in Malaysia and makes recommendations on strategies that can \nimprove both the patients’ clinical outcomes and quality of life.\nFinally, I would like to thank Dr Jeyamalar Rajadurai and the multidisciplinary team on \nthe expert panel who have worked hard to put this CPG together, as well as the \nexternal reviewers of this CPG. I believe this CPG will be a relevant document for \nevery practicing healthcare professional who manages patients with SCAD. \nDatuk Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah\nDirector General of Health Malaysia\n MEMBERS OF THE EXPERT PANEL  3\nCONTENTS 5\nABBREVIATION 7RATIONALE AND PROCESS OF GUIDELINE DEVELOPMENT  10\nGRADES OF RECOMMENDATION AND LEVEL OF EVIDENCE  15\nSUMMARY 161.

MONITORING AND QUALITY ASSURANCE 97\nREFERENCES 98ACKNOWLEDGMENTS 123DISCLOSURE STATEMENT 123SOURCES OF FUNDING 123\n \n6Rationale: \nCoronary Artery Disease (CAD) covers a wide spectrum from asymptomatic                   individuals to patients with stable CAD, Acute Coronary Syndromes (ACS) and \nSudden Cardiac Death (SCD). This Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) on Stable \nCAD is directed at individuals:\n • with stable chest pain or other symptoms (e.g. dyspnea) which are known or  \n  suspected to be due to CAD.  • who had a previous episode of ACS but who are now stable and need regular  \n  follow up and monitoring. \n • post revascularization by Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery (CABG) or \n  Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) who are at present asymptomatic or  \n  have stable symptoms due to CAD.\n • who are asymptomatic but are suspected or known to have CAD on non-invasive  \n  testing. This may occur in the absence or presence of ischemia and/or left  \n  ventricular (LV) dysfunction. \nThis CPG on Stable CAD has been drawn up by a committee appointed by the \nNational Heart Association of Malaysia, Ministry of Health (MOH) and the Academy \nof Medicine. It comprises cardiologists, endocrinologists, general and family \nphysicians and consultant internal medicine physicians and pharmacists from the \nPublic Health Division, government and private hospitals and the universities. This is the 2nd edition of the CPG, the first being published in 2010.\nObjectives:\nThe objectives of this CPG are to provide guidance on:\n  the diagnosis of CAD in individuals presenting with stable chest symptoms.\n  the risk stratification of individuals who are diagnosed with CAD. This helps  \n  determine the need for revascularization guided by the patient’s preferences.\n  optimal medical therapy (OMT) in all individuals with CAD.\n  revascularization strategies.\nProcess:\nA review of current medical literature on Stable CAD for the last 10 years was \nperformed. Literature search was carried out using the following electronic databases \n- PubMed and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews.The search was conducted \nfor the period January 2006 till 31st August 2016. The following MeSH terms or free \ntext terms were used either singly or in combination: \n1“angina”, “stable angina”, “stable coronary artery disease”, “stable ischemic heart \ndisease”, “refractory angina”, “epidemiology of CAD”, “pathophysiology of CAD”, \n“diagnostic testing of CAD”, “exercise stress ECG”, “stress echocardiogram”, \n“magnetic perfusion imaging”, “cardiac magnetic resonance imaging”, “coronary \ncalcium score”, “CT coronary angiogram”, “Invasive coronary angiogram”, “fractional \nflow reserve”, “iFR”, “coronary revascularization”, “optimal medical therapy”,              “percutaneous coronary intervention in stable CAD”, “coronary artery bypass \ngrafting in Stable CAD”. \nThe search was filtered to clinical trials and reviews, involving humans and \npublished in the English language. The relevant articles were carefully selected from this huge list. In addition, the reference lists of all relevant articles retrieved were \nsearched to identify further studies. Local CPGs were also studied. Experts in the \nfield were also contacted to obtain further information. International guidelines \nmainly that from the American Heart Association/ American College of Cardiology \n(AHA/ACC) and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) were used as main references.\n \nAll literature retrieved were appraised by members of the Expert Panel and all \nstatements and recommendations made were collectively agreed by the group. The \ngrading of evidence and the level of recommendation used in this CPG was adapted from the AHA/ACC and the ESC (pg 15).\nAfter much discussion, the draft was then drawn up and submitted to the Technical \nAdvisory Committee for Clinical Practice Guidelines, MOH Malaysia and key health \npersonnel in the major hospitals of the MOH and the private sector for review and feedback.\nClinical Questions Addressed:\nThere were several topics and subtopics that were formulated using the patient, \nintervention, comparison, outcome (PICO) method, addressing diagnosis, prognosis and management of Stable CAD.\nThe topics and subtopics were as follows:\nP: Population- Persons: \n   who are asymptomatic with no previous history of CAD \n   with chest pain suspected to be due to CAD\n   with known CAD\n   with diabetes\n   with chronic kidney disease\n   who are elderly\n   womenI: Intervention:\n  For diagnosis and Prognosis:   \n   Resting electrocardiogram (ECG)\n   Chest X-Ray\n   2D echocardiogram\n   Exercise stress ECG\n   Stress echocardiogram\n   Myocardial perfusion imaging(MPI)\n   Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) Imaging \n   Coronary Calcium (CAC) Score\n   CT coronary angiogram\n   Invasive coronary angiogram\n   Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR) and iFR\n For management:\n   Optimal medical therapy - including diet, exercise\n   Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)\n   Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG)\nC: Comparison:\n   Different diagnostic modalities\n   Optimal medical therapy vs PCI vs CABG in Stable CAD\nO: Outcome:   Accuracy of the test in making a diagnosis of CAD - i.e. its validity, reliability\n   Reduction in Cardiovascular (CV) Disease- CV Events, vascular mortality\n   Reduction in All cause mortality\nType of Question- Involves:   Diagnosis - Diagnosis of CAD \n   Therapy - optimal medical therapy, PCI, CABG\n   Harm - Increase in CV Event Rate, mortality\n   Prognosis - Reduction in CV events and mortality\n   Prevention of CV Disease \nType of Study:\n   Systematic review and meta analysis\n   Randomised Controlled Studies\n   Cohort studiesThus, there were numerous clinical questions formulated.E.g. of some of these Clinical Questions:\n  What is the validity (sensitivity, specificity and predictive value) of an Exercise  \n  ECG in an asymptomatic individual with no previous medical illness, in the  \n  diagnosis of CAD?  What is the validity (sensitivity, specificity and predictive value) of an Exercise  \n  ECG in diagnosing CAD in an individual with chest pain suspected to be due  \n  to CAD?\n  What is the validity (sensitivity, specificity and predictive value) of an Exercise  \n  ECG when compared to a stress echocardiogram in diagnosing CAD in an  \n  individual with chest pain suspected to be due to CAD?\n  What is the prognostic value of an abnormal Exercise ECG in an individual   \n  with chest pain suspected to be due to CAD?\n  In an individual with known stable CAD, does optimal medical therapy as  \n  compared to PCI, lead to a reduction in CV events and all cause mortality?  \nTarget Group:\nThese guidelines are directed at all healthcare providers - all medical practitioners, \nand allied health personnel.\nTarget Population:\nThese guidelines are directed at individuals with stable CAD.\nPeriod of Validity of the Guidelines:\nThese guidelines need to be revised at least every 5 years to keep abreast with new developments and knowledge.\nImplementation of the Guidelines:\nThe implementation of the recommendations of a CPG is part of good clinical \ngovernance. To ensure successful implementation of this CPG we suggest:  Continuous medical education and training of healthcare providers on diagnosis  \n  and management of Stable CAD. This can be done by road shows, electronic  \n  media, and in-house training sessions.\n  Performance measures that include:\n    Percentage of patients with Stable CAD on optimal medical therapy with  \n   aspirin (or clopidogrel or ticlid if aspirin intolerance) and statin therapy?\nApplicability of the Guidelines and Resource Implications:\nThis guideline was developed taking into consideration our local health resources. \nAlmost all the investigations and most of the medications recommended are             \navailable in public hospitals or at the cardiac centres in Malaysia.This guideline aims to educate health care professionals on strategies to optimize \nexisting resources in the diagnosis and management of stable CAD.\nFacilitators and Barriers:\nThe main barrier for the successful implementation of this CPG is the lack of            knowledge of the public and healthcare providers on the: \n  role/limitations of the available non-invasive investigations in the diagnosis and  \n  risk stratification of individuals with CAD.\n  benefits of optimal medical therapy in the management of persons with stable  \n  CAD.  \n  role/limitations of PCI in the management of individuals with stable CAD-the  \n  fallacies of the “oculostenotic reflex”.   “commercialization” of the medical industry in promoting expensive and   \n  sometimes unnecessary investigations and PCIs."

It comprises cardiologists, endocrinologists, general and family \nphysicians and consultant internal medicine physicians and pharmacists from the \nPublic Health Division, government and private hospitals and the universities. This is the 2nd edition of the CPG, the first being published in 2010.\nObjectives:\nThe objectives of this CPG are to provide guidance on:\n  the diagnosis of CAD in individuals presenting with stable chest symptoms.\n  the risk stratification of individuals who are diagnosed with CAD. This helps  \n  determine the need for revascularization guided by the patient’s preferences.\n  optimal medical therapy (OMT) in all individuals with CAD.\n  revascularization strategies.\nProcess:\nA review of current medical literature on Stable CAD for the last 10 years was \nperformed. Literature search was carried out using the following electronic databases \n- PubMed and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews.The search was conducted \nfor the period January 2006 till 31st August 2016. The following MeSH terms or free \ntext terms were used either singly or in combination: \n1“angina”, “stable angina”, “stable coronary artery disease”, “stable ischemic heart \ndisease”, “refractory angina”, “epidemiology of CAD”, “pathophysiology of CAD”, \n“diagnostic testing of CAD”, “exercise stress ECG”, “stress echocardiogram”, \n“magnetic perfusion imaging”, “cardiac magnetic resonance imaging”, “coronary \ncalcium score”, “CT coronary angiogram”, “Invasive coronary angiogram”, “fractional \nflow reserve”, “iFR”, “coronary revascularization”, “optimal medical therapy”,              “percutaneous coronary intervention in stable CAD”, “coronary artery bypass \ngrafting in Stable CAD”. \nThe search was filtered to clinical trials and reviews, involving humans and \npublished in the English language. The relevant articles were carefully selected from this huge list. In addition, the reference lists of all relevant articles retrieved were \nsearched to identify further studies. Local CPGs were also studied. Experts in the \nfield were also contacted to obtain further information. International guidelines \nmainly that from the American Heart Association/ American College of Cardiology \n(AHA/ACC) and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) were used as main references.\n \nAll literature retrieved were appraised by members of the Expert Panel and all \nstatements and recommendations made were collectively agreed by the group. The \ngrading of evidence and the level of recommendation used in this CPG was adapted from the AHA/ACC and the ESC (pg 15).\nAfter much discussion, the draft was then drawn up and submitted to the Technical \nAdvisory Committee for Clinical Practice Guidelines, MOH Malaysia and key health \npersonnel in the major hospitals of the MOH and the private sector for review and feedback.\nClinical Questions Addressed:\nThere were several topics and subtopics that were formulated using the patient, \nintervention, comparison, outcome (PICO) method, addressing diagnosis, prognosis and management of Stable CAD.\nThe topics and subtopics were as follows:\nP: Population- Persons: \n   who are asymptomatic with no previous history of CAD \n   with chest pain suspected to be due to CAD\n   with known CAD\n   with diabetes\n   with chronic kidney disease\n   who are elderly\n   womenI: Intervention:\n  For diagnosis and Prognosis:   \n   Resting electrocardiogram (ECG)\n   Chest X-Ray\n   2D echocardiogram\n   Exercise stress ECG\n   Stress echocardiogram\n   Myocardial perfusion imaging(MPI)\n   Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) Imaging \n   Coronary Calcium (CAC) Score\n   CT coronary angiogram\n   Invasive coronary angiogram\n   Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR) and iFR\n For management:\n   Optimal medical therapy - including diet, exercise\n   Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)\n   Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG)\nC: Comparison:\n   Different diagnostic modalities\n   Optimal medical therapy vs PCI vs CABG in Stable CAD\nO: Outcome:   Accuracy of the test in making a diagnosis of CAD - i.e. its validity, reliability\n   Reduction in Cardiovascular (CV) Disease- CV Events, vascular mortality\n   Reduction in All cause mortality\nType of Question- Involves:   Diagnosis - Diagnosis of CAD \n   Therapy - optimal medical therapy, PCI, CABG\n   Harm - Increase in CV Event Rate, mortality\n   Prognosis - Reduction in CV events and mortality\n   Prevention of CV Disease \nType of Study:\n   Systematic review and meta analysis\n   Randomised Controlled Studies\n   Cohort studiesThus, there were numerous clinical questions formulated.E.g. of some of these Clinical Questions:\n  What is the validity (sensitivity, specificity and predictive value) of an Exercise  \n  ECG in an asymptomatic individual with no previous medical illness, in the  \n  diagnosis of CAD?  What is the validity (sensitivity, specificity and predictive value) of an Exercise  \n  ECG in diagnosing CAD in an individual with chest pain suspected to be due  \n  to CAD?\n  What is the validity (sensitivity, specificity and predictive value) of an Exercise  \n  ECG when compared to a stress echocardiogram in diagnosing CAD in an  \n  individual with chest pain suspected to be due to CAD?\n  What is the prognostic value of an abnormal Exercise ECG in an individual   \n  with chest pain suspected to be due to CAD?\n  In an individual with known stable CAD, does optimal medical therapy as  \n  compared to PCI, lead to a reduction in CV events and all cause mortality?  \nTarget Group:\nThese guidelines are directed at all healthcare providers - all medical practitioners, \nand allied health personnel.\nTarget Population:\nThese guidelines are directed at individuals with stable CAD.\nPeriod of Validity of the Guidelines:\nThese guidelines need to be revised at least every 5 years to keep abreast with new developments and knowledge.\nImplementation of the Guidelines:\nThe implementation of the recommendations of a CPG is part of good clinical \ngovernance. To ensure successful implementation of this CPG we suggest:  Continuous medical education and training of healthcare providers on diagnosis  \n  and management of Stable CAD. This can be done by road shows, electronic  \n  media, and in-house training sessions.\n  Performance measures that include:\n    Percentage of patients with Stable CAD on optimal medical therapy with  \n   aspirin (or clopidogrel or ticlid if aspirin intolerance) and statin therapy?\nApplicability of the Guidelines and Resource Implications:\nThis guideline was developed taking into consideration our local health resources. \nAlmost all the investigations and most of the medications recommended are             \navailable in public hospitals or at the cardiac centres in Malaysia.This guideline aims to educate health care professionals on strategies to optimize \nexisting resources in the diagnosis and management of stable CAD.\nFacilitators and Barriers:\nThe main barrier for the successful implementation of this CPG is the lack of            knowledge of the public and healthcare providers on the: \n  role/limitations of the available non-invasive investigations in the diagnosis and  \n  risk stratification of individuals with CAD.\n  benefits of optimal medical therapy in the management of persons with stable  \n  CAD.  \n  role/limitations of PCI in the management of individuals with stable CAD-the  \n  fallacies of the “oculostenotic reflex”.   “commercialization” of the medical industry in promoting expensive and   \n  sometimes unnecessary investigations and PCIs."

This Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) on Stable \nCAD is directed at individuals:\n • with stable chest pain or other symptoms (e.g. dyspnea) which are known or  \n  suspected to be due to CAD.  • who had a previous episode of ACS but who are now stable and need regular  \n  follow up and monitoring. \n • post revascularization by Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery (CABG) or \n  Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) who are at present asymptomatic or  \n  have stable symptoms due to CAD.\n • who are asymptomatic but are suspected or known to have CAD on non-invasive  \n  testing. This may occur in the absence or presence of ischemia and/or left  \n  ventricular (LV) dysfunction. \nThis CPG on Stable CAD has been drawn up by a committee appointed by the \nNational Heart Association of Malaysia, Ministry of Health (MOH) and the Academy \nof Medicine.

It is important in risk stratification and in determining the optimal  \n mode of revascularization.\nThe RISK STRATIFICATION of patients with CAD who have stable symptoms of at \nleast 2 months duration involves:\n Clinical evaluation \n Resting ECG \n Assessment of LV function by echocardiography\n Non-invasive assessment for myocardial ischemia - (Table 2, pg 24) Where indicated, evaluation of coronary anatomy and physiological assessment  \n of the significance of the coronary lesion by Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR).\nRisk may be defined as:\n high risk - annual mortality of >3% intermediate risk - annual mortality of 1-3% low risk - annual mortality of <1%\nIn general, individuals with no ischemia demonstrated by non-invasive testing and/or \nhave no or minimal plaque in the coronary arteries by CTA have an excellent prognosis with a rate of cardiovascular (CV) death/non-fatal Myocardial Infarction(MI) of <0.5% and an annual mortality of <1%.\n Low risk individuals can be managed with risk factor reduction and/or anti  \n anginal medications as necessary. Revascularization has not been shown to  \n improve their long-term CV outcomes. Thus, no further intervention is required.  \n This includes individuals who are:\n  asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic.\n  have no demonstrable or minimal ischemia on non-invasive testing. (Table 2,  \n  pg 24)\n Intermediate risk individuals may be managed with risk reduction strategies +/-  \n anti anginal therapy or considered for invasive coronary angiogram and \n revascularization depending on the clinical condition, ischemic burden and patient  \n preferences.\n High risk individuals, in addition to risk reduction strategies, should be considered  \n for invasive coronary angiography with view to revascularization. This includes  \n individuals who:  continue to have troubling angina/angina equivalents despite OMT.\n  Have significant ischemia on non-invasive testing. (Table 2, pg 24)\nAll individuals with CAD who are at Intermediate and High Risk should be referred \nto tertiary cardiology centers for further evaluation and revascularization as indicated. Individuals at low risk can be managed both at the hospital and also in general outpatient clinics with Family Medicine Specialists. \nFollowing stabilization and revascularization, intermediate and high risk individuals \ncan be transferred back to the general outpatient clinics with Family Medicine Specialists after a period of 1 - 2 years or at the discretion of the attending doctor.\nManagement (Fig 2, pg 25) should be multifaceted and involves OMT which \nincludes both behavioural modification therapy and pharmacological therapy.\n Behavioral modification therapy (BMT) - patient education and lifestyle modification.\n Pharmacological therapy - This aims at:\n  Prevention of CV events.\n     All patients should receive aspirin and a statin (+/- non-statin therapy) with  \n   the aim of achieving a LDL-C <1.8 mmol/l - the lower the better.    All CV risk factors should be treated to target.\n    Patients with depressed LV function (LVEF <40%) should receive ACEi/ARB,  \n   β-blockers and mineralocorticoid antagonists as tolerated. Angiotensin-  \n   receptor-neprilysin inhibitors may also be considered. \n  Relieving symptoms \n    β-blockers and/or calcium channel blockers (CCBs) should be prescribed  \n   as first-line treatment to reduce angina because they are widely available.\n    Ivabradine, trimetazidine, long-acting nitrates and ranolazine are recommended  \n   as add-on therapy in patients who remain symptomatic. \n Myocardial revascularization - OMT should be instituted prior to revascularization  \n procedures. The decision to revascularize will depend on:  symptoms - presence of angina affecting quality of life. \n  extent of ischemia as determined by non-invasive testing \n  extent of coronary disease and where applicable physiological functional  \n  testing using FFR. Individuals with:    FFR <0.75 - benefit from revascularization as compared to OMT.\n    FFR between >0.75 but <0.8 - have intermediate benefit with revascularization  \n   and management should be based on clinical judgement. \n    FFR >0.8 - do not benefit from revascularization.\n Wherever possible, a discussion with the patient and Heart Team should be   \n encouraged prior to revascularization to determine the best strategy - PCI or CABG."

        "text": "Stable Coronary Artery Disease 2018\n(2nd Edition)\n1.  INTRODUCTION\nCoronary Artery Disease (CAD) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in \nMalaysia.10-12 It has been the main cause of death in both gender for over a decade \nalthough in recent years, the mortality trend has shown a small decrease.10-12 In most \nWestern countries however, mortality due to CAD has been on a significant \ndownward trend due to appropriate primary prevention strategies, improved               \ndiagnosis and early treatment.13-15\nCAD covers a wide spectrum - from persons who are asymptomatic to those presenting with ACS and sudden cardiac death (SCD). \nThis CPG on Stable CAD is directed at individuals:\n  with stable chest pain or other symptoms (e.g. dyspnoea) which are known or  \n  suspected to be due to CAD. \n  who had a previous episode of ACS but who are now stable and need regular  \n  follow up and monitoring.   post revascularization (by CABG or PCI) who are at present asymptomatic or  \n  have stable symptoms due to CAD.\n  who are asymptomatic but are suspected or known to have CAD on non-invasive  \n  testing. This may occur in the absence or presence of ischemia and/or Left  \n  Ventricular (LV) dysfunction. \nIt provides guidance on:\n  diagnosis of CAD in individuals presenting with stable chest symptoms.\n  risk stratification of individuals who are diagnosed with CAD. This helps  \n  determine the need for revascularization guided by the patient’s preferences.  optimal medical therapy in all individuals with CAD.\n  revascularization strategies.\nIndividuals with CAD, even with minimal or absent symptoms, including those \npost-revascularization, are at high risk for recurrent cardiovascular (CV) events.\n16-18 \nIn a large multinational registry, the 4-year rate of CV death, MI or stroke in patients \nwith stable CAD but no previous ischemic events was 12.2% and in those with \nprevious ischemic events, it was 18.3%.19 Almost 20% of individuals continue to \nhave angina one year after their MI.20 \nIn a more recent registry of patients with stable CAD who were enrolled 1-year post \nACS and managed in the contemporary era with optimal medical therapy, the \nprognosis was much better.21\nThis CPG does not address individuals who do not have CAD but who are at risk for \nCAD. This is covered in the CPG Primary and Secondary Prevention of CVD, 2017.22\n26\n4.  NATURAL HISTORY AND PROGNOSIS OF STABLE CAD\n  The natural history of Stable CAD is marked by episodes of sudden deterioration \ndue to plaque fissuring, ulceration or erosion with superimposed thrombosis \nresulting in an acute decrease in myocardial oxygen supply and the clinical picture \nof ACS. The episodes of chest pain become more frequent, occurring at rest or with \nminimal exertion and with no obvious trigger. Accelerated chest pain may also occur due to an episode of increased myocardial oxygen demand as in periods of emotional \nor strenuous physical stress/exertion.\nEarlier studies reported that the annual rate of MI in persons with stable angina was \n3.0-3.5%.\n42,43 Generally, the annual mortality has been estimated to be in the range \nof 1.2-2.4% per annum, cardiac death 0.6-1.4% per annum and non-fatal MI \n0.6-2.7%.44 \nHowever, in a recent registry of patients with stable CAD managed in the contemporary \nera and who had their ischemic events and/or revascularization 4 to 5 years earlier, \nthe incidence of MI occurred linearly at a rate of 0.8% per year and about a third of \nthese were STEMI.21 About 20% of the MIs in this registry were due to very late stent \nthrombosis.21 \nPrognosis in any individual patient however, will depend on the nature and extent of \nthe underlying disease, the LV function, the age of the patient, the presence of CV \nrisk factors and other co-morbidities. In the registry study mentioned earlier, baseline \npredictors of MI were: 21\n  CV risk factors such as active smoking, poorly controlled diabetes and/or lipids,\n  persistent angina and\n  multivessel disease Previous CABG was inversely associated with the risk of MI.21 \nThe most important predictors of adverse CV outcomes are LV function and the \nextent of myocardial ischemia (total ischemic burden).45–51 This is not necessarily \nequivalent to the number of vessels diseased. \nThe association between angina and the combined CV end points of CV death, MI \nor stroke is weak.52–54 Individuals with angina are, however, at increased risk for \nheart failure, CV hospitalizations, coronary revascularization and death than              individuals without angina.\n52,55 \nIn a large registry of outpatients with stable CAD, about half of CV events (CV deaths \nand non-fatal MI) occurred in individuals without angina or ischemia.56 Unlike earlier \nstudies, in this large registry, patients with angina and myocardial ischemia fared \nworse than those who only had silent ischemia.47,48,56 \nThis highlights the importance of optimal medical therapy in all patients with CAD  \nirrespective of the presence of symptoms\n      \n5.  DIAGNOSIS OF CAD -BASIC ASSESSMENT\nIn the management of individuals with suspected or known CAD, the following need \nto be performed concurrently:\n  Establishing a diagnosis of stable CAD by clinical assessment and appropriate  \n  investigations.\n  Risk stratification and prognostication. \n  Initiating Optimal Medical Therapy (OMT).\n  Determining if the patient would benefit from revascularization.Clinical assessment and relevant investigations are necessary for:\n  diagnosis and\n  prognosis\n5.1 Clinical Assessment In making a diagnosis of stable angina, a detailed history and physical            \nexamination are of paramount importance. Clinical investigations are                 \nnecessary for confirmation of the diagnosis, detection of myocardial ischemia \nand for prognostication. \n History\n  Detailed history of angina i.e. character of the pain, location, radiation  \n  and severity (Table 3, pg 29)\n    Character - heaviness, pressure, tightness, constricting or burning.\n    Location - typically present in the retrosternal area but may also be felt  \n   in the epigastrium with radiation to neck/jaw, shoulders, back and arm.\n    Duration - not more than 20 min.\n    Precipitating factors - exertion, heavy meal, emotional stress.\n    Relieving factors - rapidly relieved by rest and/or GTN.\n    Severity of chest pain can be graded according to the Canadian \n   Cardiovascular Society (CCS) Classification.\n57 (Table 4, pg 34) \n  Presence of CV risk factors i.e. diabetes mellitus, hypertension,  \n  dyslipidaemia, smoking, family history of premature CAD, (father, male  \n  sibling or son <55 years of age or mother, female sibling or daughter  \n  <65 years of age). \n  Previous history of MI and coronary revascularization.\n  Women and the elderly can present with atypical symptoms.\nAngina of less than 2 months duration is classified as recent onset or \nunstable angina (UA).58 In the presence of a good effort tolerance, normal \ncardiac biomarkers and LV function and absence of ischemia at low to moderate workloads, these individuals (low risk UA) can be managed as \nstable CAD. All other individuals should be managed as in the Clinical \nPractice Guidelines (CPG) on UA/NSTEMI.\n26 \n Physical examination \nThis involves:\n  inspection of the general habitus of the patient, looking for signs of  \n  anaemia, polycythaemia and stigmata of hyperlipidaemia.   examination of the peripheral pulses.  measurement of the blood pressure.\n  auscultation of the precordium for additional heart sounds and murmurs and the  \n  carotid and renal arteries for bruit.  excluding non-coronary causes of angina such as severe aortic stenosis,  \n  hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, and hyperthyroidism. \nIf the history of chest pain is not suggestive of angina, then other causes should be \nconsidered. (Table 5, pg 35)\nTable 4: Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) Classification of Angina\n57\n 2.  CLINICAL SPECTRUM OF STABLE CAD \nStable CAD may present as:\n  chest pain\n  dyspnoea  palpitations, near syncope and syncope\n2.1 Chest pain\nStable CAD often manifests as chest pain. Occasionally the individual may be \nasymptomatic or may have atypical symptoms e.g. pain in the jaw, shoulder or \nepigastrium precipitated by stress - physical and/or emotional (angina equivalent). \nChest pain may be categorized into:\n  Stable angina (typical/definite angina) - This is a clinical syndrome of retrosternal  \n  chest discomfort with the following characteristics and fulfilling these 3  \n  criteria:\n23–25 (Table 3, pg 29) \n  1. predictable and with possible radiation to jaw, shoulders, arms and/or back.\n  2. provoked by physical exertion and/or emotional stress.\n  3. relieved by rest and/or with glyceryl trinitrate (GTN). \n  Atypical angina (probable) - chest pain or discomfort which meets 2 out of the   \n  above 3 criteria.  Non-anginal chest pain or discomfort - this meets one or none of the typical  \n  angina criteria.\nChest pain is more likely to be due to CAD in the older individual, in males, in those \nwith a family history of premature CAD and in the presence of CV risk factors or a previous cardiac event.\nChest pain may also occur at rest due to:\n  coronary vasospasm (de novo or superimposed on a fixed stenosis) of an  \n  epicardial vessel (variant/Printzmetal angina) and/or   microvascular dysfunction.These individuals are managed as stable CAD. \nChest pain with the following features may be due to an ACS: (Section 5.1, pg 33-34)\n  of recent onset (<2 months) and/or\n  occurring at rest and/or  associated with other features such as sweating and dyspnoea.\nManagement of these individuals are in the CPGs on ST Elevation Myocardial \nInfarction (STEMI) and Unstable Angina/Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction \n(UA/NSTEMI).\n26,27 \nThe prevalence of angina is dependent upon age and sex and is often under    \nestimated.24,28 The Health Survey for England (2006) reported that 3% of women and \n8% of men aged 55 to 64 years have or had angina.25 \nIn the United States, the prevalence of angina in adults ≥20 years was 3.4% and was \nhigher in the older age groups.29 Among individuals aged 55-64 years, the \nprevalence was about 7% in both gender.29 \nIn the Malaysian National Cardiovascular Disease Registry (NCVD) ACS 2014-15 report, 9.2% of patients admitted with ACS had a history of chronic angina.\n30 In this \nregistry, this was defined as onset of chest pain more than 2 weeks prior to                   \nadmission.30\n2.2 Dyspnoea / LV dysfunction\nIndividuals with stable CAD may also present with dyspnoea. This may be due to \neither:\n  myocardial ischemia (angina equivalent) and/or   LV dysfunction from a hibernating but viable myocardium or from previously     infarcted muscle (scar tissue).\n2.3 Palpitations/near syncope/syncope\nA less common presentation is palpitations due to arrhythmia. The presence of \nsyncope/near syncope may be due to:\n  tachyarrhythmia - atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia \n  bradyarrhythmia from drug therapy, conduction disturbances and/or co existing  \n  sick sinus syndrome and/or\n  hypotension from drug therapy particularly diuretic use.Table 3: Definition of Typical/Definite Angina\n3.  PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \nAngina is due to myocardial ischemia resulting from a transient and reversible \nimbalance (mismatch) between myocardial oxygen demand and supply. This may occur in the presence of a fixed stenosis or the result of a dynamic stenosis                 \n(vasospasm) of the coronary arteries.

        "text": "Stable Coronary Artery Disease 2018\n(2nd Edition)\nKey Messages:\n CAD covers a wide spectrum – from individuals who are asymptomatic to \n those presenting with ACS and SCD. \n Individuals with CAD, even with minimal or absent symptoms, including those \n post-revascularization, are at high risk for recurrent CV events.\n4.  NATURAL HISTORY AND PROGNOSIS OF STABLE CAD  The natural history of Stable CAD is marked by episodes of sudden deterioration \ndue to plaque fissuring, ulceration or erosion with superimposed thrombosis \nresulting in an acute decrease in myocardial oxygen supply and the clinical picture \nof ACS. The episodes of chest pain become more frequent, occurring at rest or with \nminimal exertion and with no obvious trigger. Accelerated chest pain may also occur due to an episode of increased myocardial oxygen demand as in periods of emotional \nor strenuous physical stress/exertion.\nEarlier studies reported that the annual rate of MI in persons with stable angina was \n3.0-3.5%.\n42,43 Generally, the annual mortality has been estimated to be in the range \nof 1.2-2.4% per annum, cardiac death 0.6-1.4% per annum and non-fatal MI \n0.6-2.7%.44 \nHowever, in a recent registry of patients with stable CAD managed in the contemporary \nera and who had their ischemic events and/or revascularization 4 to 5 years earlier, \nthe incidence of MI occurred linearly at a rate of 0.8% per year and about a third of \nthese were STEMI.21 About 20% of the MIs in this registry were due to very late stent \nthrombosis.21 \nPrognosis in any individual patient however, will depend on the nature and extent of \nthe underlying disease, the LV function, the age of the patient, the presence of CV \nrisk factors and other co-morbidities. In the registry study mentioned earlier, baseline \npredictors of MI were: 21\n  CV risk factors such as active smoking, poorly controlled diabetes and/or lipids,\n  persistent angina and\n  multivessel disease Previous CABG was inversely associated with the risk of MI.21 \nThe most important predictors of adverse CV outcomes are LV function and the \nextent of myocardial ischemia (total ischemic burden).45–51 This is not necessarily \nequivalent to the number of vessels diseased. \nThe association between angina and the combined CV end points of CV death, MI \nor stroke is weak.52–54 Individuals with angina are, however, at increased risk for \nheart failure, CV hospitalizations, coronary revascularization and death than              individuals without angina.\n52,55 \nIn a large registry of outpatients with stable CAD, about half of CV events (CV deaths \nand non-fatal MI) occurred in individuals without angina or ischemia.56 Unlike earlier \nstudies, in this large registry, patients with angina and myocardial ischemia fared \nworse than those who only had silent ischemia.47,48,56 \nThis highlights the importance of optimal medical therapy in all patients with CAD  \nirrespective of the presence of symptoms\n      \n5.  DIAGNOSIS OF CAD -BASIC ASSESSMENT\nIn the management of individuals with suspected or known CAD, the following need \nto be performed concurrently:\n  Establishing a diagnosis of stable CAD by clinical assessment and appropriate  \n  investigations.\n  Risk stratification and prognostication. \n  Initiating Optimal Medical Therapy (OMT).\n  Determining if the patient would benefit from revascularization.Clinical assessment and relevant investigations are necessary for:\n  diagnosis and\n  prognosis\n5.1 Clinical Assessment In making a diagnosis of stable angina, a detailed history and physical            \nexamination are of paramount importance. Clinical investigations are                 \nnecessary for confirmation of the diagnosis, detection of myocardial ischemia \nand for prognostication. \n History\n  Detailed history of angina i.e. character of the pain, location, radiation  \n  and severity (Table 3, pg 29)\n    Character - heaviness, pressure, tightness, constricting or burning.\n    Location - typically present in the retrosternal area but may also be felt  \n   in the epigastrium with radiation to neck/jaw, shoulders, back and arm.\n    Duration - not more than 20 min.\n    Precipitating factors - exertion, heavy meal, emotional stress.\n    Relieving factors - rapidly relieved by rest and/or GTN.\n    Severity of chest pain can be graded according to the Canadian \n   Cardiovascular Society (CCS) Classification.\n57 (Table 4, pg 34) \n  Presence of CV risk factors i.e. diabetes mellitus, hypertension,  \n  dyslipidaemia, smoking, family history of premature CAD, (father, male  \n  sibling or son <55 years of age or mother, female sibling or daughter  \n  <65 years of age). \n  Previous history of MI and coronary revascularization.\n  Women and the elderly can present with atypical symptoms.\nAngina of less than 2 months duration is classified as recent onset or \nunstable angina (UA).58 In the presence of a good effort tolerance, normal \ncardiac biomarkers and LV function and absence of ischemia at low to moderate workloads, these individuals (low risk UA) can be managed as \nstable CAD. All other individuals should be managed as in the Clinical \nPractice Guidelines (CPG) on UA/NSTEMI.\n26 \n Physical examination \nThis involves:\n  inspection of the general habitus of the patient, looking for signs of  \n  anaemia, polycythaemia and stigmata of hyperlipidaemia.   examination of the peripheral pulses.  measurement of the blood pressure.\n  auscultation of the precordium for additional heart sounds and murmurs and the  \n  carotid and renal arteries for bruit.  excluding non-coronary causes of angina such as severe aortic stenosis,  \n  hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, and hyperthyroidism. \nIf the history of chest pain is not suggestive of angina, then other causes should be \nconsidered. (Table 5, pg 35)\nTable 4: Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) Classification of Angina\n57\n 2.  CLINICAL SPECTRUM OF STABLE CAD \nStable CAD may present as:\n  chest pain\n  dyspnoea  palpitations, near syncope and syncope\n2.1 Chest pain\nStable CAD often manifests as chest pain. Occasionally the individual may be \nasymptomatic or may have atypical symptoms e.g. pain in the jaw, shoulder or epigastrium precipitated by stress - physical and/or emotional (angina equivalent). \nChest pain may be categorized into:\n  Stable angina (typical/definite angina) - This is a clinical syndrome of retrosternal  \n  chest discomfort with the following characteristics and fulfilling these 3    criteria:\n23–25 (Table 3, pg 29) \n  1. predictable and with possible radiation to jaw, shoulders, arms and/or back.\n  2. provoked by physical exertion and/or emotional stress.\n  3. relieved by rest and/or with glyceryl trinitrate (GTN). \n  Atypical angina (probable) - chest pain or discomfort which meets 2 out of the   \n  above 3 criteria.  Non-anginal chest pain or discomfort - this meets one or none of the typical  \n  angina criteria.\nChest pain is more likely to be due to CAD in the older individual, in males, in those \nwith a family history of premature CAD and in the presence of CV risk factors or a previous cardiac event.\nChest pain may also occur at rest due to:\n  coronary vasospasm (de novo or superimposed on a fixed stenosis) of an  \n  epicardial vessel (variant/Printzmetal angina) and/or   microvascular dysfunction.These individuals are managed as stable CAD. \nChest pain with the following features may be due to an ACS: (Section 5.1, pg 33-34)\n  of recent onset (<2 months) and/or\n  occurring at rest and/or  associated with other features such as sweating and dyspnoea.\nManagement of these individuals are in the CPGs on ST Elevation Myocardial \nInfarction (STEMI) and Unstable Angina/Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction \n(UA/NSTEMI).\n26,27 \nThe prevalence of angina is dependent upon age and sex and is often under    \nestimated.24,28 The Health Survey for England (2006) reported that 3% of women and \n8% of men aged 55 to 64 years have or had angina.25 \nIn the United States, the prevalence of angina in adults ≥20 years was 3.4% and was \nhigher in the older age groups.29 Among individuals aged 55-64 years, the \nprevalence was about 7% in both gender.29 \nIn the Malaysian National Cardiovascular Disease Registry (NCVD) ACS 2014-15 report, 9.2% of patients admitted with ACS had a history of chronic angina.\n30 In this \nregistry, this was defined as onset of chest pain more than 2 weeks prior to                   \nadmission.30\n2.2 Dyspnoea / LV dysfunction\nIndividuals with stable CAD may also present with dyspnoea. This may be due to \neither:\n  myocardial ischemia (angina equivalent) and/or   LV dysfunction from a hibernating but viable myocardium or from previously     infarcted muscle (scar tissue).\n2.3 Palpitations/near syncope/syncope\nA less common presentation is palpitations due to arrhythmia. The presence of \nsyncope/near syncope may be due to:\n  tachyarrhythmia - atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia \n  bradyarrhythmia from drug therapy, conduction disturbances and/or co existing  \n  sick sinus syndrome and/or\n  hypotension from drug therapy particularly diuretic use.Table 3: Definition of Typical/Definite Angina\n3.  PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \nAngina is due to myocardial ischemia resulting from a transient and reversible \nimbalance (mismatch) between myocardial oxygen demand and supply. This may occur in the presence of a fixed stenosis or the result of a dynamic stenosis                 \n(vasospasm) of the coronary arteries. In contrast, in an ACS, the thrombotic                  \ncomponent of the ruptured plaque dominates the overall pathophysiological process \nand clinical picture.\nMyocardial ischemia may also occur in the absence of chest pain or with atypical \nsymptoms (angina equivalent) such as dyspnoea, unexplained sweating, extreme \nfatigue, or pain at a site other than the chest.

NATURAL HISTORY AND PROGNOSIS OF STABLE CAD  The natural history of Stable CAD is marked by episodes of sudden deterioration \ndue to plaque fissuring, ulceration or erosion with superimposed thrombosis \nresulting in an acute decrease in myocardial oxygen supply and the clinical picture \nof ACS. The episodes of chest pain become more frequent, occurring at rest or with \nminimal exertion and with no obvious trigger. Accelerated chest pain may also occur due to an episode of increased myocardial oxygen demand as in periods of emotional \nor strenuous physical stress/exertion.\nEarlier studies reported that the annual rate of MI in persons with stable angina was \n3.0-3.5%.\n42,43 Generally, the annual mortality has been estimated to be in the range \nof 1.2-2.4% per annum, cardiac death 0.6-1.4% per annum and non-fatal MI \n0.6-2.7%.44 \nHowever, in a recent registry of patients with stable CAD managed in the contemporary \nera and who had their ischemic events and/or revascularization 4 to 5 years earlier, \nthe incidence of MI occurred linearly at a rate of 0.8% per year and about a third of \nthese were STEMI.21 About 20% of the MIs in this registry were due to very late stent \nthrombosis.21 \nPrognosis in any individual patient however, will depend on the nature and extent of \nthe underlying disease, the LV function, the age of the patient, the presence of CV \nrisk factors and other co-morbidities. In the registry study mentioned earlier, baseline \npredictors of MI were: 21\n  CV risk factors such as active smoking, poorly controlled diabetes and/or lipids,\n  persistent angina and\n  multivessel disease Previous CABG was inversely associated with the risk of MI.21 \nThe most important predictors of adverse CV outcomes are LV function and the \nextent of myocardial ischemia (total ischemic burden).45–51 This is not necessarily \nequivalent to the number of vessels diseased. \nThe association between angina and the combined CV end points of CV death, MI \nor stroke is weak.52–54 Individuals with angina are, however, at increased risk for \nheart failure, CV hospitalizations, coronary revascularization and death than              individuals without angina.\n52,55 \nIn a large registry of outpatients with stable CAD, about half of CV events (CV deaths \nand non-fatal MI) occurred in individuals without angina or ischemia.56 Unlike earlier \nstudies, in this large registry, patients with angina and myocardial ischemia fared \nworse than those who only had silent ischemia.47,48,56 \nThis highlights the importance of optimal medical therapy in all patients with CAD  \nirrespective of the presence of symptoms\n      \n5.  DIAGNOSIS OF CAD -BASIC ASSESSMENT\nIn the management of individuals with suspected or known CAD, the following need \nto be performed concurrently:\n  Establishing a diagnosis of stable CAD by clinical assessment and appropriate  \n  investigations.\n  Risk stratification and prognostication. \n  Initiating Optimal Medical Therapy (OMT).\n  Determining if the patient would benefit from revascularization.Clinical assessment and relevant investigations are necessary for:\n  diagnosis and\n  prognosis\n5.1 Clinical Assessment In making a diagnosis of stable angina, a detailed history and physical            \nexamination are of paramount importance. Clinical investigations are                 \nnecessary for confirmation of the diagnosis, detection of myocardial ischemia \nand for prognostication. \n History\n  Detailed history of angina i.e. character of the pain, location, radiation  \n  and severity (Table 3, pg 29)\n    Character - heaviness, pressure, tightness, constricting or burning.\n    Location - typically present in the retrosternal area but may also be felt  \n   in the epigastrium with radiation to neck/jaw, shoulders, back and arm.\n    Duration - not more than 20 min.\n    Precipitating factors - exertion, heavy meal, emotional stress.\n    Relieving factors - rapidly relieved by rest and/or GTN.\n    Severity of chest pain can be graded according to the Canadian \n   Cardiovascular Society (CCS) Classification.\n57 (Table 4, pg 34) \n  Presence of CV risk factors i.e. diabetes mellitus, hypertension,  \n  dyslipidaemia, smoking, family history of premature CAD, (father, male  \n  sibling or son <55 years of age or mother, female sibling or daughter  \n  <65 years of age). \n  Previous history of MI and coronary revascularization.\n  Women and the elderly can present with atypical symptoms.\nAngina of less than 2 months duration is classified as recent onset or \nunstable angina (UA).58 In the presence of a good effort tolerance, normal \ncardiac biomarkers and LV function and absence of ischemia at low to moderate workloads, these individuals (low risk UA) can be managed as \nstable CAD. All other individuals should be managed as in the Clinical \nPractice Guidelines (CPG) on UA/NSTEMI.\n26 \n Physical examination \nThis involves:\n  inspection of the general habitus of the patient, looking for signs of  \n  anaemia, polycythaemia and stigmata of hyperlipidaemia.   examination of the peripheral pulses.  measurement of the blood pressure.\n  auscultation of the precordium for additional heart sounds and murmurs and the  \n  carotid and renal arteries for bruit.  excluding non-coronary causes of angina such as severe aortic stenosis,  \n  hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, and hyperthyroidism. \nIf the history of chest pain is not suggestive of angina, then other causes should be \nconsidered. (Table 5, pg 35)\nTable 4: Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) Classification of Angina\n57\n 2.  CLINICAL SPECTRUM OF STABLE CAD \nStable CAD may present as:\n  chest pain\n  dyspnoea  palpitations, near syncope and syncope\n2.1 Chest pain\nStable CAD often manifests as chest pain. Occasionally the individual may be \nasymptomatic or may have atypical symptoms e.g. pain in the jaw, shoulder or \nepigastrium precipitated by stress - physical and/or emotional (angina equivalent). \nChest pain may be categorized into:\n  Stable angina (typical/definite angina) - This is a clinical syndrome of retrosternal  \n  chest discomfort with the following characteristics and fulfilling these 3  \n  criteria:\n23–25 (Table 3, pg 29) \n  1. predictable and with possible radiation to jaw, shoulders, arms and/or back.\n  2. provoked by physical exertion and/or emotional stress.\n  3. relieved by rest and/or with glyceryl trinitrate (GTN). \n  Atypical angina (probable) - chest pain or discomfort which meets 2 out of the   \n  above 3 criteria.  Non-anginal chest pain or discomfort - this meets one or none of the typical  \n  angina criteria.\nChest pain is more likely to be due to CAD in the older individual, in males, in those \nwith a family history of premature CAD and in the presence of CV risk factors or a previous cardiac event.\nChest pain may also occur at rest due to:\n  coronary vasospasm (de novo or superimposed on a fixed stenosis) of an  \n  epicardial vessel (variant/Printzmetal angina) and/or   microvascular dysfunction.These individuals are managed as stable CAD. \nChest pain with the following features may be due to an ACS: (Section 5.1, pg 33-34)\n  of recent onset (<2 months) and/or\n  occurring at rest and/or  associated with other features such as sweating and dyspnoea.\nManagement of these individuals are in the CPGs on ST Elevation Myocardial \nInfarction (STEMI) and Unstable Angina/Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction \n(UA/NSTEMI).\n26,27 \nThe prevalence of angina is dependent upon age and sex and is often under    \nestimated.24,28 The Health Survey for England (2006) reported that 3% of women and \n8% of men aged 55 to 64 years have or had angina.25 \nIn the United States, the prevalence of angina in adults ≥20 years was 3.4% and was \nhigher in the older age groups.29 Among individuals aged 55-64 years, the \nprevalence was about 7% in both gender.29 \nIn the Malaysian National Cardiovascular Disease Registry (NCVD) ACS 2014-15 report, 9.2% of patients admitted with ACS had a history of chronic angina.\n30 In this \nregistry, this was defined as onset of chest pain more than 2 weeks prior to                   \nadmission.30\n2.2 Dyspnoea / LV dysfunction\nIndividuals with stable CAD may also present with dyspnoea. This may be due to \neither:\n  myocardial ischemia (angina equivalent) and/or   LV dysfunction from a hibernating but viable myocardium or from previously     infarcted muscle (scar tissue).\n2.3 Palpitations/near syncope/syncope\nA less common presentation is palpitations due to arrhythmia. The presence of \nsyncope/near syncope may be due to:\n  tachyarrhythmia - atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia \n  bradyarrhythmia from drug therapy, conduction disturbances and/or co existing  \n  sick sinus syndrome and/or\n  hypotension from drug therapy particularly diuretic use.Table 3: Definition of Typical/Definite Angina\n3.  PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \nAngina is due to myocardial ischemia resulting from a transient and reversible \nimbalance (mismatch) between myocardial oxygen demand and supply. This may occur in the presence of a fixed stenosis or the result of a dynamic stenosis                 (vasospasm) of the coronary arteries. In contrast, in an ACS, the thrombotic                  \ncomponent of the ruptured plaque dominates the overall pathophysiological process \nand clinical picture.\nMyocardial ischemia may also occur in the absence of chest pain or with atypical \nsymptoms (angina equivalent) such as dyspnoea, unexplained sweating, extreme \nfatigue, or pain at a site other than the chest. This is more common in diabetics, the \nelderly and in women.Myocardial ischemia may occur in the presence of:31\n  Atherosclerotic obstructive CAD (coronary lesions >50% luminal narrowing)\n  Non-obstructive CAD (≥20% and <50% luminal narrowing). The prognosis of  \n  these patients is worse if myocardial ischemia is documented.\n  Normal coronary arteries (Cardiac Syndrome X) - (<20% luminal narrowing)\n  The commonest cause of myocardial ischemia is atherosclerotic plaque related  \n  obstructive CAD. Generally, in stable CAD, a stenosis of ≥50% in the left main  \n  coronary artery and ≥70% in one or several of the major epicardial coronary  \n  arteries is necessary to cause myocardial ischemia. In an ACS, lesser degrees  \n  of coronary stenosis may give rise to angina. \nThe pathophysiology of myocardial ischemia in patients with non-obstructive CAD \nand normal coronaries is not clear. Postulated mechanisms include: \n  coronary vasospasm\n  microvascular dysfunction. About 50% of women with chest pain have evidence \n  of microvascular dysfunction,32-34 but only about 20% to 25% showed signs of  \n  ischaemia33,35,36 There are no gender differences in the prevalence of coronary  \n  microvascular dysfunction.37\n  myocardial bridging - At autopsy, the incidence has been reported to be  \n  between 40-80% although functional myocardial bridging is less common  \n  (0.5% to 16.0% of cases).38,39 The left anterior descending coronary artery is  \n  most commonly involved. These patients are generally asymptomatic but may  \n  present with exertional angina, syncope, and even sudden death. Medical  \n  therapy with β -blockers and CCBs remain the mainstay of treatment.38,39 If  \n  medical therapy fails, surgery may be considered.39 Stent implantation may be  \n  complicated by stent fracture, perforation, thrombosis and restenosis.39 \n  enhanced pain perception.40,41 \nOther common causes of myocardial ischemia include:  hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy   aortic stenosis\n  coronary vasculitis from connective tissue disease\n  aortic aneurysms\n  anaemia - this may be a precipitating cause for the angina\nTable 5: Other causes of non-ischaemic chest pain\n5.2 Biochemistry\n \nRelevant laboratory investigations are performed to assess the general health status of the individual and to look for co-morbidities.

Clinical investigations are                 \nnecessary for confirmation of the diagnosis, detection of myocardial ischemia \nand for prognostication. \n History\n  Detailed history of angina i.e. character of the pain, location, radiation  \n  and severity (Table 3, pg 29)\n    Character - heaviness, pressure, tightness, constricting or burning.\n    Location - typically present in the retrosternal area but may also be felt  \n   in the epigastrium with radiation to neck/jaw, shoulders, back and arm.\n    Duration - not more than 20 min.\n    Precipitating factors - exertion, heavy meal, emotional stress.\n    Relieving factors - rapidly relieved by rest and/or GTN.\n    Severity of chest pain can be graded according to the Canadian \n   Cardiovascular Society (CCS) Classification.\n57 (Table 4, pg 34) \n  Presence of CV risk factors i.e. diabetes mellitus, hypertension,  \n  dyslipidaemia, smoking, family history of premature CAD, (father, male  \n  sibling or son <55 years of age or mother, female sibling or daughter  \n  <65 years of age). \n  Previous history of MI and coronary revascularization.\n  Women and the elderly can present with atypical symptoms.\nAngina of less than 2 months duration is classified as recent onset or \nunstable angina (UA).58 In the presence of a good effort tolerance, normal \ncardiac biomarkers and LV function and absence of ischemia at low to moderate workloads, these individuals (low risk UA) can be managed as \nstable CAD.

(Table 5, pg 35)\nTable 4: Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) Classification of Angina\n57\n 2.  CLINICAL SPECTRUM OF STABLE CAD \nStable CAD may present as:\n  chest pain\n  dyspnoea  palpitations, near syncope and syncope\n2.1 Chest pain\nStable CAD often manifests as chest pain. Occasionally the individual may be \nasymptomatic or may have atypical symptoms e.g. pain in the jaw, shoulder or \nepigastrium precipitated by stress - physical and/or emotional (angina equivalent). \nChest pain may be categorized into:\n  Stable angina (typical/definite angina) - This is a clinical syndrome of retrosternal  \n  chest discomfort with the following characteristics and fulfilling these 3  \n  criteria:\n23–25 (Table 3, pg 29) \n  1. predictable and with possible radiation to jaw, shoulders, arms and/or back.\n  2. provoked by physical exertion and/or emotional stress.\n  3. relieved by rest and/or with glyceryl trinitrate (GTN). \n  Atypical angina (probable) - chest pain or discomfort which meets 2 out of the   \n  above 3 criteria.  Non-anginal chest pain or discomfort - this meets one or none of the typical  \n  angina criteria.\nChest pain is more likely to be due to CAD in the older individual, in males, in those \nwith a family history of premature CAD and in the presence of CV risk factors or a previous cardiac event.\nChest pain may also occur at rest due to:\n  coronary vasospasm (de novo or superimposed on a fixed stenosis) of an  \n  epicardial vessel (variant/Printzmetal angina) and/or   microvascular dysfunction.These individuals are managed as stable CAD. \nChest pain with the following features may be due to an ACS: (Section 5.1, pg 33-34)\n  of recent onset (<2 months) and/or\n  occurring at rest and/or  associated with other features such as sweating and dyspnoea.\nManagement of these individuals are in the CPGs on ST Elevation Myocardial \nInfarction (STEMI) and Unstable Angina/Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction \n(UA/NSTEMI).\n26,27 \nThe prevalence of angina is dependent upon age and sex and is often under    \nestimated.24,28 The Health Survey for England (2006) reported that 3% of women and \n8% of men aged 55 to 64 years have or had angina.25 \nIn the United States, the prevalence of angina in adults ≥20 years was 3.4% and was \nhigher in the older age groups.29 Among individuals aged 55-64 years, the \nprevalence was about 7% in both gender.29 \nIn the Malaysian National Cardiovascular Disease Registry (NCVD) ACS 2014-15 report, 9.2% of patients admitted with ACS had a history of chronic angina.\n30 In this \nregistry, this was defined as onset of chest pain more than 2 weeks prior to                   \nadmission.30\n2.2 Dyspnoea / LV dysfunction\nIndividuals with stable CAD may also present with dyspnoea. This may be due to \neither:\n  myocardial ischemia (angina equivalent) and/or   LV dysfunction from a hibernating but viable myocardium or from previously     infarcted muscle (scar tissue).\n2.3 Palpitations/near syncope/syncope\nA less common presentation is palpitations due to arrhythmia. The presence of \nsyncope/near syncope may be due to:\n  tachyarrhythmia - atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia \n  bradyarrhythmia from drug therapy, conduction disturbances and/or co existing  \n  sick sinus syndrome and/or\n  hypotension from drug therapy particularly diuretic use.Table 3: Definition of Typical/Definite Angina\n3.  PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \nAngina is due to myocardial ischemia resulting from a transient and reversible \nimbalance (mismatch) between myocardial oxygen demand and supply. This may \noccur in the presence of a fixed stenosis or the result of a dynamic stenosis                 \n(vasospasm) of the coronary arteries. In contrast, in an ACS, the thrombotic                  \ncomponent of the ruptured plaque dominates the overall pathophysiological process \nand clinical picture.\nMyocardial ischemia may also occur in the absence of chest pain or with atypical \nsymptoms (angina equivalent) such as dyspnoea, unexplained sweating, extreme \nfatigue, or pain at a site other than the chest. This is more common in diabetics, the \nelderly and in women.Myocardial ischemia may occur in the presence of:\n31\n  Atherosclerotic obstructive CAD (coronary lesions >50% luminal narrowing)\n  Non-obstructive CAD (≥20% and <50% luminal narrowing). The prognosis of  \n  these patients is worse if myocardial ischemia is documented.\n  Normal coronary arteries (Cardiac Syndrome X) - (<20% luminal narrowing)\n  The commonest cause of myocardial ischemia is atherosclerotic plaque related  \n  obstructive CAD. Generally, in stable CAD, a stenosis of ≥50% in the left main  \n  coronary artery and ≥70% in one or several of the major epicardial coronary  \n  arteries is necessary to cause myocardial ischemia. In an ACS, lesser degrees  \n  of coronary stenosis may give rise to angina. \nThe pathophysiology of myocardial ischemia in patients with non-obstructive CAD \nand normal coronaries is not clear. Postulated mechanisms include: \n  coronary vasospasm\n  microvascular dysfunction. About 50% of women with chest pain have evidence \n  of microvascular dysfunction,32-34 but only about 20% to 25% showed signs of  \n  ischaemia33,35,36 There are no gender differences in the prevalence of coronary  \n  microvascular dysfunction.37\n  myocardial bridging - At autopsy, the incidence has been reported to be  \n  between 40-80% although functional myocardial bridging is less common  \n  (0.5% to 16.0% of cases).38,39 The left anterior descending coronary artery is  \n  most commonly involved. These patients are generally asymptomatic but may  \n  present with exertional angina, syncope, and even sudden death. Medical  \n  therapy with β -blockers and CCBs remain the mainstay of treatment.38,39 If  \n  medical therapy fails, surgery may be considered.39 Stent implantation may be  \n  complicated by stent fracture, perforation, thrombosis and restenosis.39 \n  enhanced pain perception.40,41 \nOther common causes of myocardial ischemia include:  hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy   aortic stenosis\n  coronary vasculitis from connective tissue disease\n  aortic aneurysms\n  anaemia - this may be a precipitating cause for the angina\nTable 5: Other causes of non-ischaemic chest pain\n5.2 Biochemistry\n \nRelevant laboratory investigations are performed to assess the general health status of the individual and to look for co-morbidities. These include:\n  Full Blood Count\n  Fasting glucose and/or A1c\n  Lipid profile - fasting or non-fasting\n  Renal profile - electrolyte, serum creatinine and/or glomerular filtration  \n  rate (eGFR)\n  Liver enzymes\n5.3 Resting ECG \nAll patients with chest pain/ angina equivalent should have a baseline resting \n12-lead ECG performed. \nPreferably, the ECG should be done during an episode of chest pain. \nThe resting 12 lead ECG:\n  is usually normal - A normal resting ECG does not rule out CAD or  \n  myocardial ischemia.\n  may show evidence of CAD such as pathological Q waves, left bundle  \n  branch block (LBBB), ST-T abnormalities.  may help to identify other causes of chest discomfort such as pericardial  \n  disease, dynamic ST-T changes of coronary vasospasm, hypertrophic    obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM).\n5.4 Echocardiography (at rest)\nEchocardiography is not a routine investigation in individuals suspected            \nof having CAD.

DIAGNOSIS OF CAD -BASIC ASSESSMENT\nIn the management of individuals with suspected or known CAD, the following need \nto be performed concurrently:\n  Establishing a diagnosis of stable CAD by clinical assessment and appropriate  \n  investigations.\n  Risk stratification and prognostication. \n  Initiating Optimal Medical Therapy (OMT).\n  Determining if the patient would benefit from revascularization.Clinical assessment and relevant investigations are necessary for:\n  diagnosis and\n  prognosis\n5.1 Clinical Assessment \nIn making a diagnosis of stable angina, a detailed history and physical            \nexamination are of paramount importance. Clinical investigations are                 \nnecessary for confirmation of the diagnosis, detection of myocardial ischemia \nand for prognostication. \n History\n  Detailed history of angina i.e. character of the pain, location, radiation  \n  and severity (Table 3, pg 29)    Character - heaviness, pressure, tightness, constricting or burning.\n    Location - typically present in the retrosternal area but may also be felt  \n   in the epigastrium with radiation to neck/jaw, shoulders, back and arm.\n    Duration - not more than 20 min.\n    Precipitating factors - exertion, heavy meal, emotional stress.\n    Relieving factors - rapidly relieved by rest and/or GTN.\n    Severity of chest pain can be graded according to the Canadian \n   Cardiovascular Society (CCS) Classification.\n57 (Table 4, pg 34) \n  Presence of CV risk factors i.e. diabetes mellitus, hypertension,  \n  dyslipidaemia, smoking, family history of premature CAD, (father, male  \n  sibling or son <55 years of age or mother, female sibling or daughter  \n  <65 years of age). \n  Previous history of MI and coronary revascularization.\n  Women and the elderly can present with atypical symptoms.\nAngina of less than 2 months duration is classified as recent onset or \nunstable angina (UA).58 In the presence of a good effort tolerance, normal \ncardiac biomarkers and LV function and absence of ischemia at low to moderate workloads, these individuals (low risk UA) can be managed as \nstable CAD. All other individuals should be managed as in the Clinical \nPractice Guidelines (CPG) on UA/NSTEMI.\n26 \n Physical examination \nThis involves:\n  inspection of the general habitus of the patient, looking for signs of  \n  anaemia, polycythaemia and stigmata of hyperlipidaemia.   examination of the peripheral pulses.  measurement of the blood pressure.\n  auscultation of the precordium for additional heart sounds and murmurs and the  \n  carotid and renal arteries for bruit.\n  excluding non-coronary causes of angina such as severe aortic stenosis,  \n  hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, and hyperthyroidism. \nIf the history of chest pain is not suggestive of angina, then other causes should be \nconsidered. (Table 5, pg 35)\nTable 4: Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) Classification of Angina57\n 2.  CLINICAL SPECTRUM OF STABLE CAD \nStable CAD may present as:\n  chest pain\n  dyspnoea  palpitations, near syncope and syncope\n2.1 Chest pain\nStable CAD often manifests as chest pain. Occasionally the individual may be \nasymptomatic or may have atypical symptoms e.g. pain in the jaw, shoulder or \nepigastrium precipitated by stress - physical and/or emotional (angina equivalent). \nChest pain may be categorized into:\n  Stable angina (typical/definite angina) - This is a clinical syndrome of retrosternal  \n  chest discomfort with the following characteristics and fulfilling these 3  \n  criteria:\n23–25 (Table 3, pg 29) \n  1. predictable and with possible radiation to jaw, shoulders, arms and/or back.\n  2. provoked by physical exertion and/or emotional stress.\n  3. relieved by rest and/or with glyceryl trinitrate (GTN). \n  Atypical angina (probable) - chest pain or discomfort which meets 2 out of the   \n  above 3 criteria.  Non-anginal chest pain or discomfort - this meets one or none of the typical  \n  angina criteria.\nChest pain is more likely to be due to CAD in the older individual, in males, in those \nwith a family history of premature CAD and in the presence of CV risk factors or a previous cardiac event.\nChest pain may also occur at rest due to:\n  coronary vasospasm (de novo or superimposed on a fixed stenosis) of an  \n  epicardial vessel (variant/Printzmetal angina) and/or   microvascular dysfunction.These individuals are managed as stable CAD. \nChest pain with the following features may be due to an ACS: (Section 5.1, pg 33-34)\n  of recent onset (<2 months) and/or\n  occurring at rest and/or  associated with other features such as sweating and dyspnoea.\nManagement of these individuals are in the CPGs on ST Elevation Myocardial \nInfarction (STEMI) and Unstable Angina/Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction \n(UA/NSTEMI).\n26,27 \nThe prevalence of angina is dependent upon age and sex and is often under    \nestimated.24,28 The Health Survey for England (2006) reported that 3% of women and \n8% of men aged 55 to 64 years have or had angina.25 \nIn the United States, the prevalence of angina in adults ≥20 years was 3.4% and was \nhigher in the older age groups.29 Among individuals aged 55-64 years, the \nprevalence was about 7% in both gender.29 \nIn the Malaysian National Cardiovascular Disease Registry (NCVD) ACS 2014-15 report, 9.2% of patients admitted with ACS had a history of chronic angina.\n30 In this \nregistry, this was defined as onset of chest pain more than 2 weeks prior to                   \nadmission.30\n2.2 Dyspnoea / LV dysfunction\nIndividuals with stable CAD may also present with dyspnoea. This may be due to \neither:\n  myocardial ischemia (angina equivalent) and/or   LV dysfunction from a hibernating but viable myocardium or from previously     infarcted muscle (scar tissue).\n2.3 Palpitations/near syncope/syncope\nA less common presentation is palpitations due to arrhythmia. The presence of \nsyncope/near syncope may be due to:\n  tachyarrhythmia - atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia \n  bradyarrhythmia from drug therapy, conduction disturbances and/or co existing  \n  sick sinus syndrome and/or\n  hypotension from drug therapy particularly diuretic use.Table 3: Definition of Typical/Definite Angina\n3.  PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \nAngina is due to myocardial ischemia resulting from a transient and reversible \nimbalance (mismatch) between myocardial oxygen demand and supply. This may \noccur in the presence of a fixed stenosis or the result of a dynamic stenosis                 \n(vasospasm) of the coronary arteries. In contrast, in an ACS, the thrombotic                  \ncomponent of the ruptured plaque dominates the overall pathophysiological process \nand clinical picture.\nMyocardial ischemia may also occur in the absence of chest pain or with atypical \nsymptoms (angina equivalent) such as dyspnoea, unexplained sweating, extreme \nfatigue, or pain at a site other than the chest. This is more common in diabetics, the \nelderly and in women.Myocardial ischemia may occur in the presence of:\n31\n  Atherosclerotic obstructive CAD (coronary lesions >50% luminal narrowing)\n  Non-obstructive CAD (≥20% and <50% luminal narrowing). The prognosis of  \n  these patients is worse if myocardial ischemia is documented.\n  Normal coronary arteries (Cardiac Syndrome X) - (<20% luminal narrowing)\n  The commonest cause of myocardial ischemia is atherosclerotic plaque related  \n  obstructive CAD. Generally, in stable CAD, a stenosis of ≥50% in the left main  \n  coronary artery and ≥70% in one or several of the major epicardial coronary  \n  arteries is necessary to cause myocardial ischemia. In an ACS, lesser degrees  \n  of coronary stenosis may give rise to angina. \nThe pathophysiology of myocardial ischemia in patients with non-obstructive CAD \nand normal coronaries is not clear. Postulated mechanisms include: \n  coronary vasospasm\n  microvascular dysfunction. About 50% of women with chest pain have evidence \n  of microvascular dysfunction,32-34 but only about 20% to 25% showed signs of  \n  ischaemia33,35,36 There are no gender differences in the prevalence of coronary  \n  microvascular dysfunction.37\n  myocardial bridging - At autopsy, the incidence has been reported to be  \n  between 40-80% although functional myocardial bridging is less common  \n  (0.5% to 16.0% of cases).38,39 The left anterior descending coronary artery is  \n  most commonly involved. These patients are generally asymptomatic but may  \n  present with exertional angina, syncope, and even sudden death. Medical  \n  therapy with β -blockers and CCBs remain the mainstay of treatment.38,39 If  \n  medical therapy fails, surgery may be considered.39 Stent implantation may be  \n  complicated by stent fracture, perforation, thrombosis and restenosis.39 \n  enhanced pain perception.40,41 \nOther common causes of myocardial ischemia include:  hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy   aortic stenosis\n  coronary vasculitis from connective tissue disease\n  aortic aneurysms\n  anaemia - this may be a precipitating cause for the angina\nTable 5: Other causes of non-ischaemic chest pain\n5.2 Biochemistry\n \nRelevant laboratory investigations are performed to assess the general health status of the individual and to look for co-morbidities. These include:\n  Full Blood Count\n  Fasting glucose and/or A1c\n  Lipid profile - fasting or non-fasting\n  Renal profile - electrolyte, serum creatinine and/or glomerular filtration  \n  rate (eGFR)\n  Liver enzymes\n5.3 Resting ECG \nAll patients with chest pain/ angina equivalent should have a baseline resting \n12-lead ECG performed. \nPreferably, the ECG should be done during an episode of chest pain. \nThe resting 12 lead ECG:\n  is usually normal - A normal resting ECG does not rule out CAD or  \n  myocardial ischemia.\n  may show evidence of CAD such as pathological Q waves, left bundle  \n  branch block (LBBB), ST-T abnormalities.  may help to identify other causes of chest discomfort such as pericardial  \n  disease, dynamic ST-T changes of coronary vasospasm, hypertrophic    obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM).\n5.4 Echocardiography (at rest)\nEchocardiography is not a routine investigation in individuals suspected            \nof having CAD. In most of these individuals, the study is normal. The                    echocardiogram, however, provides valuable information on LV function \nwhich is important in risk stratification. \nIt is indicated in the:\n  Presence of abnormal auscultatory findings and/or \n  Presence of abnormal resting ECG and/or \n  Assessment of LV function/regional wall motion abnormalities in patients  \n  with shortness of breath and/or known CAD.  \nIt is a useful test to assess LV function in individuals with:\n  hypertension and/or diabetes.\n  chest pain suspected to be due to CAD5.5 Chest radiography\nThe diagnostic yield of a chest radiograph in individuals with stable CAD is \nlow. \nWhere indicated, it may be helpful in assessing cardiac size, pulmonary \nvasculature and excluding certain non-cardiac causes of chest pain.\nIt is not a routine investigation in individuals with suspected or known stable \nCAD."

In the registry study mentioned earlier, baseline \npredictors of MI were: 21\n  CV risk factors such as active smoking, poorly controlled diabetes and/or lipids,\n  persistent angina and\n  multivessel disease Previous CABG was inversely associated with the risk of MI.21 \nThe most important predictors of adverse CV outcomes are LV function and the \nextent of myocardial ischemia (total ischemic burden).45–51 This is not necessarily \nequivalent to the number of vessels diseased. \nThe association between angina and the combined CV end points of CV death, MI \nor stroke is weak.52–54 Individuals with angina are, however, at increased risk for \nheart failure, CV hospitalizations, coronary revascularization and death than              individuals without angina.\n52,55 \nIn a large registry of outpatients with stable CAD, about half of CV events (CV deaths \nand non-fatal MI) occurred in individuals without angina or ischemia.56 Unlike earlier \nstudies, in this large registry, patients with angina and myocardial ischemia fared \nworse than those who only had silent ischemia.47,48,56 \nThis highlights the importance of optimal medical therapy in all patients with CAD  \nirrespective of the presence of symptoms\n      \n5.  DIAGNOSIS OF CAD -BASIC ASSESSMENT\nIn the management of individuals with suspected or known CAD, the following need \nto be performed concurrently:\n  Establishing a diagnosis of stable CAD by clinical assessment and appropriate  \n  investigations.\n  Risk stratification and prognostication. \n  Initiating Optimal Medical Therapy (OMT).\n  Determining if the patient would benefit from revascularization.Clinical assessment and relevant investigations are necessary for:\n  diagnosis and\n  prognosis\n5.1 Clinical Assessment In making a diagnosis of stable angina, a detailed history and physical            \nexamination are of paramount importance. Clinical investigations are                 \nnecessary for confirmation of the diagnosis, detection of myocardial ischemia \nand for prognostication. \n History\n  Detailed history of angina i.e. character of the pain, location, radiation  \n  and severity (Table 3, pg 29)\n    Character - heaviness, pressure, tightness, constricting or burning.\n    Location - typically present in the retrosternal area but may also be felt  \n   in the epigastrium with radiation to neck/jaw, shoulders, back and arm.\n    Duration - not more than 20 min.\n    Precipitating factors - exertion, heavy meal, emotional stress.\n    Relieving factors - rapidly relieved by rest and/or GTN.\n    Severity of chest pain can be graded according to the Canadian \n   Cardiovascular Society (CCS) Classification.\n57 (Table 4, pg 34) \n  Presence of CV risk factors i.e. diabetes mellitus, hypertension,  \n  dyslipidaemia, smoking, family history of premature CAD, (father, male  \n  sibling or son <55 years of age or mother, female sibling or daughter  \n  <65 years of age). \n  Previous history of MI and coronary revascularization.\n  Women and the elderly can present with atypical symptoms.\nAngina of less than 2 months duration is classified as recent onset or \nunstable angina (UA).58 In the presence of a good effort tolerance, normal \ncardiac biomarkers and LV function and absence of ischemia at low to moderate workloads, these individuals (low risk UA) can be managed as \nstable CAD. All other individuals should be managed as in the Clinical \nPractice Guidelines (CPG) on UA/NSTEMI.\n26 \n Physical examination \nThis involves:\n  inspection of the general habitus of the patient, looking for signs of  \n  anaemia, polycythaemia and stigmata of hyperlipidaemia.   examination of the peripheral pulses.  measurement of the blood pressure.\n  auscultation of the precordium for additional heart sounds and murmurs and the  \n  carotid and renal arteries for bruit.  excluding non-coronary causes of angina such as severe aortic stenosis,  \n  hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, and hyperthyroidism. \nIf the history of chest pain is not suggestive of angina, then other causes should be \nconsidered. (Table 5, pg 35)\nTable 4: Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) Classification of Angina\n57\n 2.  CLINICAL SPECTRUM OF STABLE CAD \nStable CAD may present as:\n  chest pain\n  dyspnoea  palpitations, near syncope and syncope\n2.1 Chest pain\nStable CAD often manifests as chest pain. Occasionally the individual may be \nasymptomatic or may have atypical symptoms e.g. pain in the jaw, shoulder or \nepigastrium precipitated by stress - physical and/or emotional (angina equivalent). \nChest pain may be categorized into:\n  Stable angina (typical/definite angina) - This is a clinical syndrome of retrosternal  \n  chest discomfort with the following characteristics and fulfilling these 3  \n  criteria:\n23–25 (Table 3, pg 29) \n  1. predictable and with possible radiation to jaw, shoulders, arms and/or back.\n  2. provoked by physical exertion and/or emotional stress.\n  3. relieved by rest and/or with glyceryl trinitrate (GTN). \n  Atypical angina (probable) - chest pain or discomfort which meets 2 out of the   \n  above 3 criteria.  Non-anginal chest pain or discomfort - this meets one or none of the typical  \n  angina criteria.\nChest pain is more likely to be due to CAD in the older individual, in males, in those \nwith a family history of premature CAD and in the presence of CV risk factors or a previous cardiac event.\nChest pain may also occur at rest due to:\n  coronary vasospasm (de novo or superimposed on a fixed stenosis) of an  \n  epicardial vessel (variant/Printzmetal angina) and/or   microvascular dysfunction.These individuals are managed as stable CAD. \nChest pain with the following features may be due to an ACS: (Section 5.1, pg 33-34)\n  of recent onset (<2 months) and/or\n  occurring at rest and/or  associated with other features such as sweating and dyspnoea.\nManagement of these individuals are in the CPGs on ST Elevation Myocardial \nInfarction (STEMI) and Unstable Angina/Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction \n(UA/NSTEMI).\n26,27 \nThe prevalence of angina is dependent upon age and sex and is often under    \nestimated.24,28 The Health Survey for England (2006) reported that 3% of women and \n8% of men aged 55 to 64 years have or had angina.25 \nIn the United States, the prevalence of angina in adults ≥20 years was 3.4% and was \nhigher in the older age groups.29 Among individuals aged 55-64 years, the \nprevalence was about 7% in both gender.29 \nIn the Malaysian National Cardiovascular Disease Registry (NCVD) ACS 2014-15 report, 9.2% of patients admitted with ACS had a history of chronic angina.\n30 In this \nregistry, this was defined as onset of chest pain more than 2 weeks prior to                   \nadmission.30\n2.2 Dyspnoea / LV dysfunction\nIndividuals with stable CAD may also present with dyspnoea. This may be due to \neither:\n  myocardial ischemia (angina equivalent) and/or   LV dysfunction from a hibernating but viable myocardium or from previously     infarcted muscle (scar tissue).\n2.3 Palpitations/near syncope/syncope\nA less common presentation is palpitations due to arrhythmia. The presence of \nsyncope/near syncope may be due to:\n  tachyarrhythmia - atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia \n  bradyarrhythmia from drug therapy, conduction disturbances and/or co existing  \n  sick sinus syndrome and/or\n  hypotension from drug therapy particularly diuretic use.Table 3: Definition of Typical/Definite Angina\n3.  PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \nAngina is due to myocardial ischemia resulting from a transient and reversible \nimbalance (mismatch) between myocardial oxygen demand and supply. This may \noccur in the presence of a fixed stenosis or the result of a dynamic stenosis                 \n(vasospasm) of the coronary arteries. In contrast, in an ACS, the thrombotic                  \ncomponent of the ruptured plaque dominates the overall pathophysiological process \nand clinical picture.\nMyocardial ischemia may also occur in the absence of chest pain or with atypical \nsymptoms (angina equivalent) such as dyspnoea, unexplained sweating, extreme \nfatigue, or pain at a site other than the chest. This is more common in diabetics, the \nelderly and in women.Myocardial ischemia may occur in the presence of:\n31\n  Atherosclerotic obstructive CAD (coronary lesions >50% luminal narrowing)\n  Non-obstructive CAD (≥20% and <50% luminal narrowing). The prognosis of  \n  these patients is worse if myocardial ischemia is documented.\n  Normal coronary arteries (Cardiac Syndrome X) - (<20% luminal narrowing)\n  The commonest cause of myocardial ischemia is atherosclerotic plaque related  \n  obstructive CAD. Generally, in stable CAD, a stenosis of ≥50% in the left main  \n  coronary artery and ≥70% in one or several of the major epicardial coronary  \n  arteries is necessary to cause myocardial ischemia. In an ACS, lesser degrees  \n  of coronary stenosis may give rise to angina. \nThe pathophysiology of myocardial ischemia in patients with non-obstructive CAD \nand normal coronaries is not clear. Postulated mechanisms include: \n  coronary vasospasm\n  microvascular dysfunction. About 50% of women with chest pain have evidence \n  of microvascular dysfunction,32-34 but only about 20% to 25% showed signs of  \n  ischaemia33,35,36 There are no gender differences in the prevalence of coronary  \n  microvascular dysfunction.37\n  myocardial bridging - At autopsy, the incidence has been reported to be  \n  between 40-80% although functional myocardial bridging is less common  \n  (0.5% to 16.0% of cases).38,39 The left anterior descending coronary artery is  \n  most commonly involved. These patients are generally asymptomatic but may  \n  present with exertional angina, syncope, and even sudden death. Medical  \n  therapy with β -blockers and CCBs remain the mainstay of treatment.38,39 If  \n  medical therapy fails, surgery may be considered.39 Stent implantation may be  \n  complicated by stent fracture, perforation, thrombosis and restenosis.39 \n  enhanced pain perception.40,41 \nOther common causes of myocardial ischemia include:  hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy   aortic stenosis\n  coronary vasculitis from connective tissue disease\n  aortic aneurysms\n  anaemia - this may be a precipitating cause for the angina\nTable 5: Other causes of non-ischaemic chest pain\n5.2 Biochemistry\n \nRelevant laboratory investigations are performed to assess the general health status of the individual and to look for co-morbidities. These include:\n  Full Blood Count\n  Fasting glucose and/or A1c\n  Lipid profile - fasting or non-fasting\n  Renal profile - electrolyte, serum creatinine and/or glomerular filtration  \n  rate (eGFR)\n  Liver enzymesI, C\nI, C\nI, C\nI, C\nIIa, C System Involvement Condition\n Gastrointestinal system Gastro-oesophageal reflux\n   Oesophageal spasm\n   Peptic Ulcer Disease\n   Gallstone disease\n   Pancreatitis\n Respiratory system Pleurisy\n   Pneumothorax\n   Pulmonary Embolism\n   Pneumonia\n Neurology  Neuralgia\n Psychiatry   Anxiety disorder\n   Psychosomatic disorder\n Musculoskeletal Costochondritis\n   Myalgia \n Cardiovascular Pericarditis\n5.3 Resting ECG All patients with chest pain/ angina equivalent should have a baseline resting \n12-lead ECG performed. \nPreferably, the ECG should be done during an episode of chest pain. \nThe resting 12 lead ECG:\n  is usually normal - A normal resting ECG does not rule out CAD or  \n  myocardial ischemia.\n  may show evidence of CAD such as pathological Q waves, left bundle  \n  branch block (LBBB), ST-T abnormalities.  may help to identify other causes of chest discomfort such as pericardial  \n  disease, dynamic ST-T changes of coronary vasospasm, hypertrophic    obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM).\n5.4 Echocardiography (at rest)\nEchocardiography is not a routine investigation in individuals suspected            \nof having CAD. In most of these individuals, the study is normal. The                    echocardiogram, however, provides valuable information on LV function \nwhich is important in risk stratification. \nIt is indicated in the:\n  Presence of abnormal auscultatory findings and/or \n  Presence of abnormal resting ECG and/or \n  Assessment of LV function/regional wall motion abnormalities in patients  \n  with shortness of breath and/or known CAD.  \nIt is a useful test to assess LV function in individuals with:\n  hypertension and/or diabetes.\n  chest pain suspected to be due to CAD5.5 Chest radiography\nThe diagnostic yield of a chest radiograph in individuals with stable CAD is \nlow. \nWhere indicated, it may be helpful in assessing cardiac size, pulmonary \nvasculature and excluding certain non-cardiac causes of chest pain.\nIt is not a routine investigation in individuals with suspected or known stable \nCAD."

In the registry study mentioned earlier, baseline \npredictors of MI were: 21\n  CV risk factors such as active smoking, poorly controlled diabetes and/or lipids,\n  persistent angina and\n  multivessel disease Previous CABG was inversely associated with the risk of MI.21 \nThe most important predictors of adverse CV outcomes are LV function and the \nextent of myocardial ischemia (total ischemic burden).45–51 This is not necessarily \nequivalent to the number of vessels diseased. \nThe association between angina and the combined CV end points of CV death, MI \nor stroke is weak.52–54 Individuals with angina are, however, at increased risk for \nheart failure, CV hospitalizations, coronary revascularization and death than              individuals without angina.\n52,55 \nIn a large registry of outpatients with stable CAD, about half of CV events (CV deaths \nand non-fatal MI) occurred in individuals without angina or ischemia.56 Unlike earlier \nstudies, in this large registry, patients with angina and myocardial ischemia fared \nworse than those who only had silent ischemia.47,48,56 \nThis highlights the importance of optimal medical therapy in all patients with CAD  \nirrespective of the presence of symptoms\n      \n5.  DIAGNOSIS OF CAD -BASIC ASSESSMENT\nIn the management of individuals with suspected or known CAD, the following need \nto be performed concurrently:\n  Establishing a diagnosis of stable CAD by clinical assessment and appropriate  \n  investigations.\n  Risk stratification and prognostication. \n  Initiating Optimal Medical Therapy (OMT).\n  Determining if the patient would benefit from revascularization.Clinical assessment and relevant investigations are necessary for:\n  diagnosis and\n  prognosis\n5.1 Clinical Assessment In making a diagnosis of stable angina, a detailed history and physical            \nexamination are of paramount importance. Clinical investigations are                 \nnecessary for confirmation of the diagnosis, detection of myocardial ischemia \nand for prognostication. \n History\n  Detailed history of angina i.e. character of the pain, location, radiation  \n  and severity (Table 3, pg 29)\n    Character - heaviness, pressure, tightness, constricting or burning.\n    Location - typically present in the retrosternal area but may also be felt  \n   in the epigastrium with radiation to neck/jaw, shoulders, back and arm.\n    Duration - not more than 20 min.\n    Precipitating factors - exertion, heavy meal, emotional stress.\n    Relieving factors - rapidly relieved by rest and/or GTN.\n    Severity of chest pain can be graded according to the Canadian \n   Cardiovascular Society (CCS) Classification.\n57 (Table 4, pg 34) \n  Presence of CV risk factors i.e. diabetes mellitus, hypertension,  \n  dyslipidaemia, smoking, family history of premature CAD, (father, male  \n  sibling or son <55 years of age or mother, female sibling or daughter  \n  <65 years of age). \n  Previous history of MI and coronary revascularization.\n  Women and the elderly can present with atypical symptoms.\nAngina of less than 2 months duration is classified as recent onset or \nunstable angina (UA).58 In the presence of a good effort tolerance, normal \ncardiac biomarkers and LV function and absence of ischemia at low to moderate workloads, these individuals (low risk UA) can be managed as \nstable CAD. All other individuals should be managed as in the Clinical \nPractice Guidelines (CPG) on UA/NSTEMI.\n26 \n Physical examination \nThis involves:\n  inspection of the general habitus of the patient, looking for signs of  \n  anaemia, polycythaemia and stigmata of hyperlipidaemia.   examination of the peripheral pulses.  measurement of the blood pressure.\n  auscultation of the precordium for additional heart sounds and murmurs and the  \n  carotid and renal arteries for bruit.  excluding non-coronary causes of angina such as severe aortic stenosis,  \n  hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, and hyperthyroidism. \nIf the history of chest pain is not suggestive of angina, then other causes should be \nconsidered. (Table 5, pg 35)\nTable 4: Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) Classification of Angina\n57\n 2.  CLINICAL SPECTRUM OF STABLE CAD \nStable CAD may present as:\n  chest pain\n  dyspnoea  palpitations, near syncope and syncope\n2.1 Chest pain\nStable CAD often manifests as chest pain. Occasionally the individual may be \nasymptomatic or may have atypical symptoms e.g. pain in the jaw, shoulder or \nepigastrium precipitated by stress - physical and/or emotional (angina equivalent). \nChest pain may be categorized into:\n  Stable angina (typical/definite angina) - This is a clinical syndrome of retrosternal  \n  chest discomfort with the following characteristics and fulfilling these 3  \n  criteria:\n23–25 (Table 3, pg 29) \n  1. predictable and with possible radiation to jaw, shoulders, arms and/or back.\n  2. provoked by physical exertion and/or emotional stress.\n  3. relieved by rest and/or with glyceryl trinitrate (GTN). \n  Atypical angina (probable) - chest pain or discomfort which meets 2 out of the   \n  above 3 criteria.  Non-anginal chest pain or discomfort - this meets one or none of the typical  \n  angina criteria.\nChest pain is more likely to be due to CAD in the older individual, in males, in those \nwith a family history of premature CAD and in the presence of CV risk factors or a previous cardiac event.\nChest pain may also occur at rest due to:\n  coronary vasospasm (de novo or superimposed on a fixed stenosis) of an  \n  epicardial vessel (variant/Printzmetal angina) and/or   microvascular dysfunction.These individuals are managed as stable CAD. \nChest pain with the following features may be due to an ACS: (Section 5.1, pg 33-34)\n  of recent onset (<2 months) and/or\n  occurring at rest and/or  associated with other features such as sweating and dyspnoea.\nManagement of these individuals are in the CPGs on ST Elevation Myocardial \nInfarction (STEMI) and Unstable Angina/Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction \n(UA/NSTEMI).\n26,27 \nThe prevalence of angina is dependent upon age and sex and is often under    \nestimated.24,28 The Health Survey for England (2006) reported that 3% of women and \n8% of men aged 55 to 64 years have or had angina.25 \nIn the United States, the prevalence of angina in adults ≥20 years was 3.4% and was \nhigher in the older age groups.29 Among individuals aged 55-64 years, the \nprevalence was about 7% in both gender.29 \nIn the Malaysian National Cardiovascular Disease Registry (NCVD) ACS 2014-15 report, 9.2% of patients admitted with ACS had a history of chronic angina.\n30 In this \nregistry, this was defined as onset of chest pain more than 2 weeks prior to                   \nadmission.30\n2.2 Dyspnoea / LV dysfunction\nIndividuals with stable CAD may also present with dyspnoea. This may be due to \neither:\n  myocardial ischemia (angina equivalent) and/or   LV dysfunction from a hibernating but viable myocardium or from previously     infarcted muscle (scar tissue).\n2.3 Palpitations/near syncope/syncope\nA less common presentation is palpitations due to arrhythmia. The presence of \nsyncope/near syncope may be due to:\n  tachyarrhythmia - atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia \n  bradyarrhythmia from drug therapy, conduction disturbances and/or co existing  \n  sick sinus syndrome and/or\n  hypotension from drug therapy particularly diuretic use.Table 3: Definition of Typical/Definite Angina\n3.  PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \nAngina is due to myocardial ischemia resulting from a transient and reversible \nimbalance (mismatch) between myocardial oxygen demand and supply. This may occur in the presence of a fixed stenosis or the result of a dynamic stenosis                 \n(vasospasm) of the coronary arteries. In contrast, in an ACS, the thrombotic                  \ncomponent of the ruptured plaque dominates the overall pathophysiological process \nand clinical picture.\nMyocardial ischemia may also occur in the absence of chest pain or with atypical \nsymptoms (angina equivalent) such as dyspnoea, unexplained sweating, extreme \nfatigue, or pain at a site other than the chest. This is more common in diabetics, the \nelderly and in women.Myocardial ischemia may occur in the presence of:\n31\n  Atherosclerotic obstructive CAD (coronary lesions >50% luminal narrowing)\n  Non-obstructive CAD (≥20% and <50% luminal narrowing). The prognosis of  \n  these patients is worse if myocardial ischemia is documented.\n  Normal coronary arteries (Cardiac Syndrome X) - (<20% luminal narrowing)\n  The commonest cause of myocardial ischemia is atherosclerotic plaque related  \n  obstructive CAD. Generally, in stable CAD, a stenosis of ≥50% in the left main  \n  coronary artery and ≥70% in one or several of the major epicardial coronary  \n  arteries is necessary to cause myocardial ischemia. In an ACS, lesser degrees  \n  of coronary stenosis may give rise to angina. \nThe pathophysiology of myocardial ischemia in patients with non-obstructive CAD \nand normal coronaries is not clear. Postulated mechanisms include: \n  coronary vasospasm\n  microvascular dysfunction. About 50% of women with chest pain have evidence \n  of microvascular dysfunction,32-34 but only about 20% to 25% showed signs of  \n  ischaemia33,35,36 There are no gender differences in the prevalence of coronary  \n  microvascular dysfunction.37\n  myocardial bridging - At autopsy, the incidence has been reported to be  \n  between 40-80% although functional myocardial bridging is less common  \n  (0.5% to 16.0% of cases).38,39 The left anterior descending coronary artery is  \n  most commonly involved. These patients are generally asymptomatic but may  \n  present with exertional angina, syncope, and even sudden death. Medical  \n  therapy with β -blockers and CCBs remain the mainstay of treatment.38,39 If  \n  medical therapy fails, surgery may be considered.39 Stent implantation may be  \n  complicated by stent fracture, perforation, thrombosis and restenosis.39 \n  enhanced pain perception.40,41 \nOther common causes of myocardial ischemia include:  hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy   aortic stenosis\n  coronary vasculitis from connective tissue disease\n  aortic aneurysms\n  anaemia - this may be a precipitating cause for the angina\nTable 5: Other causes of non-ischaemic chest pain\n5.2 Biochemistry\n \nRelevant laboratory investigations are performed to assess the general health status of the individual and to look for co-morbidities. These include:\n  Full Blood Count\n  Fasting glucose and/or A1c\n  Lipid profile - fasting or non-fasting\n  Renal profile - electrolyte, serum creatinine and/or glomerular filtration  \n  rate (eGFR)\n  Liver enzymes\n5.3 Resting ECG \nAll patients with chest pain/ angina equivalent should have a baseline resting \n12-lead ECG performed. \nPreferably, the ECG should be done during an episode of chest pain. \nThe resting 12 lead ECG:\n  is usually normal - A normal resting ECG does not rule out CAD or  \n  myocardial ischemia.\n  may show evidence of CAD such as pathological Q waves, left bundle  \n  branch block (LBBB), ST-T abnormalities.  may help to identify other causes of chest discomfort such as pericardial  \n  disease, dynamic ST-T changes of coronary vasospasm, hypertrophic    obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM).\n5.4 Echocardiography (at rest)\nEchocardiography is not a routine investigation in individuals suspected            \nof having CAD.

OTHER NON-INVASIVE INVESTIGATIONS FOR THE DIAGNOSIS OF CAD \n6.1 Principles of diagnostic testing\nAdditional non-invasive investigations help in the diagnosis of CAD and its \nprognostication. Important considerations are availability of resources, costs \nand the potential harm of any procedure including avoiding, wherever \npossible, false positive or false negative results. A false positive result can \nresult in unnecessary, expensive further downstream investigations and \nanxiety while a false negative result can result in a missed diagnosis and opportunity for appropriate treatment.\nIn addition to a resting ECG, chest radiograph and echocardiogram, other \nnon-invasive tests may be:\n  Functional - for myocardial ischemia or  Anatomical - for visualization of the epicardial coronary arteries\nIn symptomatic patients with suspected CAD, functional testing as \ncompared to an initial strategy of anatomical testing with CTA did not result in \nan improvement in clinical outcomes.\n59 A meta-analysis found a small \ndecrease in the incidence of MI but no improvement in mortality or cardiac \ndeath at the cost of greater downstream invasive procedures.60 CTA, however, \nprovided better prognostic information than functional testing by identifying patients at risk due to non-obstructive CAD.\n61 \nIn patients with known CAD presenting with atypical symptoms, a functional \ntest for myocardial ischemia is a more appropriate initial investigation.\nThe interpretation of these diagnostic investigations will depend on:\n  the pre-test probability (PTP) i.e. the likelihood of CAD in that patient.  \n  The PTP can be estimated using different models based on the patient’s  \n  age, sex and clinical history of chest pain.28,44,62–64 \n  the diagnostic accuracy of the test which is represented by its sensitivity  \n  and specificity. (Table 6, pg 39) Sensitivity is the frequency of a true  \n  positive while specificity is the frequency of a true negative. In addition,  \n  the positive predictive value is the frequency that a patient with a positive  \n  test does have CAD and the negative predictive value is the frequency  \n  that a patient with a negative test truly does not have CAD. The predictive  \n  value of a test is dependent on the prevalence of CAD in the population  \n  being studied.

NATURAL HISTORY AND PROGNOSIS OF STABLE CAD\n  The natural history of Stable CAD is marked by episodes of sudden deterioration \ndue to plaque fissuring, ulceration or erosion with superimposed thrombosis \nresulting in an acute decrease in myocardial oxygen supply and the clinical picture \nof ACS. The episodes of chest pain become more frequent, occurring at rest or with \nminimal exertion and with no obvious trigger. Accelerated chest pain may also occur due to an episode of increased myocardial oxygen demand as in periods of emotional \nor strenuous physical stress/exertion.\nEarlier studies reported that the annual rate of MI in persons with stable angina was \n3.0-3.5%.\n42,43 Generally, the annual mortality has been estimated to be in the range \nof 1.2-2.4% per annum, cardiac death 0.6-1.4% per annum and non-fatal MI \n0.6-2.7%.44 \nHowever, in a recent registry of patients with stable CAD managed in the contemporary \nera and who had their ischemic events and/or revascularization 4 to 5 years earlier, \nthe incidence of MI occurred linearly at a rate of 0.8% per year and about a third of \nthese were STEMI.21 About 20% of the MIs in this registry were due to very late stent \nthrombosis.21 \nPrognosis in any individual patient however, will depend on the nature and extent of \nthe underlying disease, the LV function, the age of the patient, the presence of CV \nrisk factors and other co-morbidities. In the registry study mentioned earlier, baseline \npredictors of MI were: 21\n  CV risk factors such as active smoking, poorly controlled diabetes and/or lipids,\n  persistent angina and\n  multivessel disease Previous CABG was inversely associated with the risk of MI.21 \nThe most important predictors of adverse CV outcomes are LV function and the \nextent of myocardial ischemia (total ischemic burden).45–51 This is not necessarily \nequivalent to the number of vessels diseased. \nThe association between angina and the combined CV end points of CV death, MI \nor stroke is weak.52–54 Individuals with angina are, however, at increased risk for \nheart failure, CV hospitalizations, coronary revascularization and death than              individuals without angina.\n52,55 \nIn a large registry of outpatients with stable CAD, about half of CV events (CV deaths \nand non-fatal MI) occurred in individuals without angina or ischemia.56 Unlike earlier \nstudies, in this large registry, patients with angina and myocardial ischemia fared \nworse than those who only had silent ischemia.47,48,56 \nThis highlights the importance of optimal medical therapy in all patients with CAD  \nirrespective of the presence of symptoms\n      \n5.  DIAGNOSIS OF CAD -BASIC ASSESSMENT\nIn the management of individuals with suspected or known CAD, the following need \nto be performed concurrently:\n  Establishing a diagnosis of stable CAD by clinical assessment and appropriate  \n  investigations.\n  Risk stratification and prognostication. \n  Initiating Optimal Medical Therapy (OMT).\n  Determining if the patient would benefit from revascularization.Clinical assessment and relevant investigations are necessary for:\n  diagnosis and\n  prognosis\n5.1 Clinical Assessment In making a diagnosis of stable angina, a detailed history and physical            \nexamination are of paramount importance. Clinical investigations are                 \nnecessary for confirmation of the diagnosis, detection of myocardial ischemia \nand for prognostication. \n History\n  Detailed history of angina i.e. character of the pain, location, radiation  \n  and severity (Table 3, pg 29)\n    Character - heaviness, pressure, tightness, constricting or burning.\n    Location - typically present in the retrosternal area but may also be felt  \n   in the epigastrium with radiation to neck/jaw, shoulders, back and arm.\n    Duration - not more than 20 min.\n    Precipitating factors - exertion, heavy meal, emotional stress.\n    Relieving factors - rapidly relieved by rest and/or GTN.\n    Severity of chest pain can be graded according to the Canadian \n   Cardiovascular Society (CCS) Classification.\n57 (Table 4, pg 34) \n  Presence of CV risk factors i.e. diabetes mellitus, hypertension,  \n  dyslipidaemia, smoking, family history of premature CAD, (father, male  \n  sibling or son <55 years of age or mother, female sibling or daughter  \n  <65 years of age). \n  Previous history of MI and coronary revascularization.\n  Women and the elderly can present with atypical symptoms.\nAngina of less than 2 months duration is classified as recent onset or \nunstable angina (UA).58 In the presence of a good effort tolerance, normal \ncardiac biomarkers and LV function and absence of ischemia at low to moderate workloads, these individuals (low risk UA) can be managed as \nstable CAD. All other individuals should be managed as in the Clinical \nPractice Guidelines (CPG) on UA/NSTEMI.\n26 \n Physical examination \nThis involves:\n  inspection of the general habitus of the patient, looking for signs of  \n  anaemia, polycythaemia and stigmata of hyperlipidaemia.   examination of the peripheral pulses.  measurement of the blood pressure.\n  auscultation of the precordium for additional heart sounds and murmurs and the  \n  carotid and renal arteries for bruit.  excluding non-coronary causes of angina such as severe aortic stenosis,  \n  hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, and hyperthyroidism. \nIf the history of chest pain is not suggestive of angina, then other causes should be \nconsidered. (Table 5, pg 35)\nTable 4: Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) Classification of Angina\n57\n 2.  CLINICAL SPECTRUM OF STABLE CAD \nStable CAD may present as:\n  chest pain\n  dyspnoea  palpitations, near syncope and syncope\n2.1 Chest pain\nStable CAD often manifests as chest pain. Occasionally the individual may be \nasymptomatic or may have atypical symptoms e.g. pain in the jaw, shoulder or \nepigastrium precipitated by stress - physical and/or emotional (angina equivalent). \nChest pain may be categorized into:\n  Stable angina (typical/definite angina) - This is a clinical syndrome of retrosternal  \n  chest discomfort with the following characteristics and fulfilling these 3  \n  criteria:\n23–25 (Table 3, pg 29) \n  1. predictable and with possible radiation to jaw, shoulders, arms and/or back.\n  2. provoked by physical exertion and/or emotional stress.\n  3. relieved by rest and/or with glyceryl trinitrate (GTN). \n  Atypical angina (probable) - chest pain or discomfort which meets 2 out of the   \n  above 3 criteria.  Non-anginal chest pain or discomfort - this meets one or none of the typical  \n  angina criteria.\nChest pain is more likely to be due to CAD in the older individual, in males, in those \nwith a family history of premature CAD and in the presence of CV risk factors or a previous cardiac event.\nChest pain may also occur at rest due to:\n  coronary vasospasm (de novo or superimposed on a fixed stenosis) of an  \n  epicardial vessel (variant/Printzmetal angina) and/or   microvascular dysfunction.These individuals are managed as stable CAD. \nChest pain with the following features may be due to an ACS: (Section 5.1, pg 33-34)\n  of recent onset (<2 months) and/or\n  occurring at rest and/or  associated with other features such as sweating and dyspnoea.\nManagement of these individuals are in the CPGs on ST Elevation Myocardial \nInfarction (STEMI) and Unstable Angina/Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction \n(UA/NSTEMI).\n26,27 \nThe prevalence of angina is dependent upon age and sex and is often under    \nestimated.24,28 The Health Survey for England (2006) reported that 3% of women and \n8% of men aged 55 to 64 years have or had angina.25 \nIn the United States, the prevalence of angina in adults ≥20 years was 3.4% and was \nhigher in the older age groups.29 Among individuals aged 55-64 years, the \nprevalence was about 7% in both gender.29 \nIn the Malaysian National Cardiovascular Disease Registry (NCVD) ACS 2014-15 report, 9.2% of patients admitted with ACS had a history of chronic angina.\n30 In this \nregistry, this was defined as onset of chest pain more than 2 weeks prior to                   \nadmission.30\n2.2 Dyspnoea / LV dysfunction\nIndividuals with stable CAD may also present with dyspnoea. This may be due to \neither:\n  myocardial ischemia (angina equivalent) and/or   LV dysfunction from a hibernating but viable myocardium or from previously     infarcted muscle (scar tissue).\n2.3 Palpitations/near syncope/syncope\nA less common presentation is palpitations due to arrhythmia. The presence of \nsyncope/near syncope may be due to:\n  tachyarrhythmia - atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia \n  bradyarrhythmia from drug therapy, conduction disturbances and/or co existing  \n  sick sinus syndrome and/or\n  hypotension from drug therapy particularly diuretic use.Table 3: Definition of Typical/Definite Angina\n3.  PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \nAngina is due to myocardial ischemia resulting from a transient and reversible \nimbalance (mismatch) between myocardial oxygen demand and supply. This may occur in the presence of a fixed stenosis or the result of a dynamic stenosis                 \n(vasospasm) of the coronary arteries. In contrast, in an ACS, the thrombotic                  \ncomponent of the ruptured plaque dominates the overall pathophysiological process \nand clinical picture.\nMyocardial ischemia may also occur in the absence of chest pain or with atypical \nsymptoms (angina equivalent) such as dyspnoea, unexplained sweating, extreme \nfatigue, or pain at a site other than the chest. This is more common in diabetics, the \nelderly and in women.Myocardial ischemia may occur in the presence of:\n31\n  Atherosclerotic obstructive CAD (coronary lesions >50% luminal narrowing)\n  Non-obstructive CAD (≥20% and <50% luminal narrowing). The prognosis of  \n  these patients is worse if myocardial ischemia is documented.\n  Normal coronary arteries (Cardiac Syndrome X) - (<20% luminal narrowing)\n  The commonest cause of myocardial ischemia is atherosclerotic plaque related  \n  obstructive CAD. Generally, in stable CAD, a stenosis of ≥50% in the left main  \n  coronary artery and ≥70% in one or several of the major epicardial coronary  \n  arteries is necessary to cause myocardial ischemia. In an ACS, lesser degrees  \n  of coronary stenosis may give rise to angina. \nThe pathophysiology of myocardial ischemia in patients with non-obstructive CAD \nand normal coronaries is not clear. Postulated mechanisms include: \n  coronary vasospasm\n  microvascular dysfunction. About 50% of women with chest pain have evidence \n  of microvascular dysfunction,32-34 but only about 20% to 25% showed signs of  \n  ischaemia33,35,36 There are no gender differences in the prevalence of coronary  \n  microvascular dysfunction.37\n  myocardial bridging - At autopsy, the incidence has been reported to be  \n  between 40-80% although functional myocardial bridging is less common  \n  (0.5% to 16.0% of cases).38,39 The left anterior descending coronary artery is  \n  most commonly involved. These patients are generally asymptomatic but may  \n  present with exertional angina, syncope, and even sudden death. Medical  \n  therapy with β -blockers and CCBs remain the mainstay of treatment.38,39 If  \n  medical therapy fails, surgery may be considered.39 Stent implantation may be  \n  complicated by stent fracture, perforation, thrombosis and restenosis.39 \n  enhanced pain perception.40,41 \nOther common causes of myocardial ischemia include:  hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy   aortic stenosis\n  coronary vasculitis from connective tissue disease\n  aortic aneurysms\n  anaemia - this may be a precipitating cause for the angina\nTable 5: Other causes of non-ischaemic chest pain\n5.2 Biochemistry\n \nRelevant laboratory investigations are performed to assess the general health status of the individual and to look for co-morbidities. These include:\n  Full Blood Count\n  Fasting glucose and/or A1c\n  Lipid profile - fasting or non-fasting\n  Renal profile - electrolyte, serum creatinine and/or glomerular filtration  \n  rate (eGFR)\n  Liver enzymes\n5.3 Resting ECG \nAll patients with chest pain/ angina equivalent should have a baseline resting \n12-lead ECG performed. \nPreferably, the ECG should be done during an episode of chest pain. \nThe resting 12 lead ECG:\n  is usually normal - A normal resting ECG does not rule out CAD or  \n  myocardial ischemia.\n  may show evidence of CAD such as pathological Q waves, left bundle  \n  branch block (LBBB), ST-T abnormalities.  may help to identify other causes of chest discomfort such as pericardial  \n  disease, dynamic ST-T changes of coronary vasospasm, hypertrophic    obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM).\n5.4 Echocardiography (at rest)\nEchocardiography is not a routine investigation in individuals suspected            \nof having CAD. In most of these individuals, the study is normal. The                    echocardiogram, however, provides valuable information on LV function \nwhich is important in risk stratification. \nIt is indicated in the:\n  Presence of abnormal auscultatory findings and/or \n  Presence of abnormal resting ECG and/or \n  Assessment of LV function/regional wall motion abnormalities in patients  \n  with shortness of breath and/or known CAD.  \nIt is a useful test to assess LV function in individuals with:\n  hypertension and/or diabetes.\n  chest pain suspected to be due to CAD5.5 Chest radiography\nThe diagnostic yield of a chest radiograph in individuals with stable CAD is \nlow. \nWhere indicated, it may be helpful in assessing cardiac size, pulmonary \nvasculature and excluding certain non-cardiac causes of chest pain.\nIt is not a routine investigation in individuals with suspected or known stable \nCAD.6.  \nOTHER NON-INVASIVE INVESTIGATIONS FOR THE DIAGNOSIS OF CAD \n6.1 Principles of diagnostic testing\nAdditional non-invasive investigations help in the diagnosis of CAD and its \nprognostication. Important considerations are availability of resources, costs \nand the potential harm of any procedure including avoiding, wherever \npossible, false positive or false negative results. A false positive result can \nresult in unnecessary, expensive further downstream investigations and \nanxiety while a false negative result can result in a missed diagnosis and opportunity for appropriate treatment.\nIn addition to a resting ECG, chest radiograph and echocardiogram, other \nnon-invasive tests may be:\n  Functional - for myocardial ischemia or  Anatomical - for visualization of the epicardial coronary arteries\nIn symptomatic patients with suspected CAD, functional testing as \ncompared to an initial strategy of anatomical testing with CTA did not result in \nan improvement in clinical outcomes.\n59 A meta-analysis found a small \ndecrease in the incidence of MI but no improvement in mortality or cardiac \ndeath at the cost of greater downstream invasive procedures.60 CTA, however, \nprovided better prognostic information than functional testing by identifying patients at risk due to non-obstructive CAD.\n61 \nIn patients with known CAD presenting with atypical symptoms, a functional \ntest for myocardial ischemia is a more appropriate initial investigation.\nThe interpretation of these diagnostic investigations will depend on:\n  the pre-test probability (PTP) i.e. the likelihood of CAD in that patient.  \n  The PTP can be estimated using different models based on the patient’s  \n  age, sex and clinical history of chest pain.28,44,62–64 \n  the diagnostic accuracy of the test which is represented by its sensitivity  \n  and specificity. (Table 6, pg 39) Sensitivity is the frequency of a true  \n  positive while specificity is the frequency of a true negative. In addition,  \n  the positive predictive value is the frequency that a patient with a positive  \n  test does have CAD and the negative predictive value is the frequency  \n  that a patient with a negative test truly does not have CAD. The predictive  \n  value of a test is dependent on the prevalence of CAD in the population  \n  being studied. As the prevalence of CAD in the population decreases,  \n  the positive predictive value declines and the negative predictive value  \n  increases. Diagnostic testing is most valuable when the pre-test probability of CAD is intermediate. \nThe precise definition of intermediate probability (i.e. between 15% and 85%) is \nsomewhat arbitrary.

NATURAL HISTORY AND PROGNOSIS OF STABLE CAD\n  The natural history of Stable CAD is marked by episodes of sudden deterioration \ndue to plaque fissuring, ulceration or erosion with superimposed thrombosis \nresulting in an acute decrease in myocardial oxygen supply and the clinical picture \nof ACS. The episodes of chest pain become more frequent, occurring at rest or with \nminimal exertion and with no obvious trigger. Accelerated chest pain may also occur due to an episode of increased myocardial oxygen demand as in periods of emotional \nor strenuous physical stress/exertion.\nEarlier studies reported that the annual rate of MI in persons with stable angina was \n3.0-3.5%.\n42,43 Generally, the annual mortality has been estimated to be in the range \nof 1.2-2.4% per annum, cardiac death 0.6-1.4% per annum and non-fatal MI \n0.6-2.7%.44 \nHowever, in a recent registry of patients with stable CAD managed in the contemporary \nera and who had their ischemic events and/or revascularization 4 to 5 years earlier, \nthe incidence of MI occurred linearly at a rate of 0.8% per year and about a third of \nthese were STEMI.21 About 20% of the MIs in this registry were due to very late stent \nthrombosis.21 \nPrognosis in any individual patient however, will depend on the nature and extent of \nthe underlying disease, the LV function, the age of the patient, the presence of CV \nrisk factors and other co-morbidities. In the registry study mentioned earlier, baseline \npredictors of MI were: 21\n  CV risk factors such as active smoking, poorly controlled diabetes and/or lipids,\n  persistent angina and\n  multivessel disease Previous CABG was inversely associated with the risk of MI.21 \nThe most important predictors of adverse CV outcomes are LV function and the \nextent of myocardial ischemia (total ischemic burden).45–51 This is not necessarily \nequivalent to the number of vessels diseased. \nThe association between angina and the combined CV end points of CV death, MI \nor stroke is weak.52–54 Individuals with angina are, however, at increased risk for \nheart failure, CV hospitalizations, coronary revascularization and death than              individuals without angina.\n52,55 \nIn a large registry of outpatients with stable CAD, about half of CV events (CV deaths \nand non-fatal MI) occurred in individuals without angina or ischemia.56 Unlike earlier \nstudies, in this large registry, patients with angina and myocardial ischemia fared \nworse than those who only had silent ischemia.47,48,56 \nThis highlights the importance of optimal medical therapy in all patients with CAD  \nirrespective of the presence of symptoms\n      \n5.  DIAGNOSIS OF CAD -BASIC ASSESSMENT\nIn the management of individuals with suspected or known CAD, the following need \nto be performed concurrently:\n  Establishing a diagnosis of stable CAD by clinical assessment and appropriate  \n  investigations.\n  Risk stratification and prognostication. \n  Initiating Optimal Medical Therapy (OMT).\n  Determining if the patient would benefit from revascularization.Clinical assessment and relevant investigations are necessary for:\n  diagnosis and\n  prognosis\n5.1 Clinical Assessment In making a diagnosis of stable angina, a detailed history and physical            \nexamination are of paramount importance. Clinical investigations are                 \nnecessary for confirmation of the diagnosis, detection of myocardial ischemia \nand for prognostication. \n History\n  Detailed history of angina i.e. character of the pain, location, radiation  \n  and severity (Table 3, pg 29)\n    Character - heaviness, pressure, tightness, constricting or burning.\n    Location - typically present in the retrosternal area but may also be felt  \n   in the epigastrium with radiation to neck/jaw, shoulders, back and arm.\n    Duration - not more than 20 min.\n    Precipitating factors - exertion, heavy meal, emotional stress.\n    Relieving factors - rapidly relieved by rest and/or GTN.\n    Severity of chest pain can be graded according to the Canadian \n   Cardiovascular Society (CCS) Classification.\n57 (Table 4, pg 34) \n  Presence of CV risk factors i.e. diabetes mellitus, hypertension,  \n  dyslipidaemia, smoking, family history of premature CAD, (father, male  \n  sibling or son <55 years of age or mother, female sibling or daughter  \n  <65 years of age). \n  Previous history of MI and coronary revascularization.\n  Women and the elderly can present with atypical symptoms.\nAngina of less than 2 months duration is classified as recent onset or \nunstable angina (UA).58 In the presence of a good effort tolerance, normal \ncardiac biomarkers and LV function and absence of ischemia at low to moderate workloads, these individuals (low risk UA) can be managed as \nstable CAD. All other individuals should be managed as in the Clinical \nPractice Guidelines (CPG) on UA/NSTEMI.\n26 \n Physical examination \nThis involves:\n  inspection of the general habitus of the patient, looking for signs of  \n  anaemia, polycythaemia and stigmata of hyperlipidaemia.   examination of the peripheral pulses.  measurement of the blood pressure.\n  auscultation of the precordium for additional heart sounds and murmurs and the  \n  carotid and renal arteries for bruit.  excluding non-coronary causes of angina such as severe aortic stenosis,  \n  hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, and hyperthyroidism. \nIf the history of chest pain is not suggestive of angina, then other causes should be \nconsidered. (Table 5, pg 35)\nTable 4: Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) Classification of Angina\n57\n 2.  CLINICAL SPECTRUM OF STABLE CAD \nStable CAD may present as:\n  chest pain\n  dyspnoea  palpitations, near syncope and syncope\n2.1 Chest pain\nStable CAD often manifests as chest pain. Occasionally the individual may be \nasymptomatic or may have atypical symptoms e.g. pain in the jaw, shoulder or \nepigastrium precipitated by stress - physical and/or emotional (angina equivalent). \nChest pain may be categorized into:\n  Stable angina (typical/definite angina) - This is a clinical syndrome of retrosternal  \n  chest discomfort with the following characteristics and fulfilling these 3  \n  criteria:\n23–25 (Table 3, pg 29) \n  1. predictable and with possible radiation to jaw, shoulders, arms and/or back.\n  2. provoked by physical exertion and/or emotional stress.\n  3. relieved by rest and/or with glyceryl trinitrate (GTN). \n  Atypical angina (probable) - chest pain or discomfort which meets 2 out of the   \n  above 3 criteria.  Non-anginal chest pain or discomfort - this meets one or none of the typical  \n  angina criteria.\nChest pain is more likely to be due to CAD in the older individual, in males, in those \nwith a family history of premature CAD and in the presence of CV risk factors or a previous cardiac event.\nChest pain may also occur at rest due to:\n  coronary vasospasm (de novo or superimposed on a fixed stenosis) of an  \n  epicardial vessel (variant/Printzmetal angina) and/or   microvascular dysfunction.These individuals are managed as stable CAD. \nChest pain with the following features may be due to an ACS: (Section 5.1, pg 33-34)\n  of recent onset (<2 months) and/or\n  occurring at rest and/or  associated with other features such as sweating and dyspnoea.\nManagement of these individuals are in the CPGs on ST Elevation Myocardial \nInfarction (STEMI) and Unstable Angina/Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction \n(UA/NSTEMI).\n26,27 \nThe prevalence of angina is dependent upon age and sex and is often under    \nestimated.24,28 The Health Survey for England (2006) reported that 3% of women and \n8% of men aged 55 to 64 years have or had angina.25 \nIn the United States, the prevalence of angina in adults ≥20 years was 3.4% and was \nhigher in the older age groups.29 Among individuals aged 55-64 years, the \nprevalence was about 7% in both gender.29 \nIn the Malaysian National Cardiovascular Disease Registry (NCVD) ACS 2014-15 report, 9.2% of patients admitted with ACS had a history of chronic angina.\n30 In this \nregistry, this was defined as onset of chest pain more than 2 weeks prior to                   \nadmission.30\n2.2 Dyspnoea / LV dysfunction\nIndividuals with stable CAD may also present with dyspnoea. This may be due to \neither:\n  myocardial ischemia (angina equivalent) and/or   LV dysfunction from a hibernating but viable myocardium or from previously     infarcted muscle (scar tissue).\n2.3 Palpitations/near syncope/syncope\nA less common presentation is palpitations due to arrhythmia. The presence of \nsyncope/near syncope may be due to:\n  tachyarrhythmia - atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia \n  bradyarrhythmia from drug therapy, conduction disturbances and/or co existing  \n  sick sinus syndrome and/or\n  hypotension from drug therapy particularly diuretic use.Table 3: Definition of Typical/Definite Angina\n3.  PATHOPHYSIOLOGY \nAngina is due to myocardial ischemia resulting from a transient and reversible \nimbalance (mismatch) between myocardial oxygen demand and supply. This may occur in the presence of a fixed stenosis or the result of a dynamic stenosis                 \n(vasospasm) of the coronary arteries. In contrast, in an ACS, the thrombotic                  \ncomponent of the ruptured plaque dominates the overall pathophysiological process \nand clinical picture.\nMyocardial ischemia may also occur in the absence of chest pain or with atypical \nsymptoms (angina equivalent) such as dyspnoea, unexplained sweating, extreme \nfatigue, or pain at a site other than the chest. This is more common in diabetics, the \nelderly and in women.Myocardial ischemia may occur in the presence of:\n31\n  Atherosclerotic obstructive CAD (coronary lesions >50% luminal narrowing)\n  Non-obstructive CAD (≥20% and <50% luminal narrowing). The prognosis of  \n  these patients is worse if myocardial ischemia is documented.\n  Normal coronary arteries (Cardiac Syndrome X) - (<20% luminal narrowing)\n  The commonest cause of myocardial ischemia is atherosclerotic plaque related  \n  obstructive CAD. Generally, in stable CAD, a stenosis of ≥50% in the left main  \n  coronary artery and ≥70% in one or several of the major epicardial coronary  \n  arteries is necessary to cause myocardial ischemia. In an ACS, lesser degrees  \n  of coronary stenosis may give rise to angina. \nThe pathophysiology of myocardial ischemia in patients with non-obstructive CAD \nand normal coronaries is not clear. Postulated mechanisms include: \n  coronary vasospasm\n  microvascular dysfunction. About 50% of women with chest pain have evidence \n  of microvascular dysfunction,32-34 but only about 20% to 25% showed signs of  \n  ischaemia33,35,36 There are no gender differences in the prevalence of coronary  \n  microvascular dysfunction.37\n  myocardial bridging - At autopsy, the incidence has been reported to be  \n  between 40-80% although functional myocardial bridging is less common  \n  (0.5% to 16.0% of cases).38,39 The left anterior descending coronary artery is  \n  most commonly involved. These patients are generally asymptomatic but may  \n  present with exertional angina, syncope, and even sudden death. Medical  \n  therapy with β -blockers and CCBs remain the mainstay of treatment.38,39 If  \n  medical therapy fails, surgery may be considered.39 Stent implantation may be  \n  complicated by stent fracture, perforation, thrombosis and restenosis.39 \n  enhanced pain perception.40,41 \nOther common causes of myocardial ischemia include:  hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy   aortic stenosis\n  coronary vasculitis from connective tissue disease\n  aortic aneurysms\n  anaemia - this may be a precipitating cause for the angina\nTable 5: Other causes of non-ischaemic chest pain\n5.2 Biochemistry\n \nRelevant laboratory investigations are performed to assess the general health status of the individual and to look for co-morbidities. These include:\n  Full Blood Count\n  Fasting glucose and/or A1c\n  Lipid profile - fasting or non-fasting\n  Renal profile - electrolyte, serum creatinine and/or glomerular filtration  \n  rate (eGFR)\n  Liver enzymes\n5.3 Resting ECG \nAll patients with chest pain/ angina equivalent should have a baseline resting \n12-lead ECG performed. \nPreferably, the ECG should be done during an episode of chest pain. \nThe resting 12 lead ECG:\n  is usually normal - A normal resting ECG does not rule out CAD or  \n  myocardial ischemia.\n  may show evidence of CAD such as pathological Q waves, left bundle  \n  branch block (LBBB), ST-T abnormalities.  may help to identify other causes of chest discomfort such as pericardial  \n  disease, dynamic ST-T changes of coronary vasospasm, hypertrophic    obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM).\n5.4 Echocardiography (at rest)\nEchocardiography is not a routine investigation in individuals suspected            \nof having CAD. In most of these individuals, the study is normal. The                    echocardiogram, however, provides valuable information on LV function \nwhich is important in risk stratification. \nIt is indicated in the:\n  Presence of abnormal auscultatory findings and/or \n  Presence of abnormal resting ECG and/or \n  Assessment of LV function/regional wall motion abnormalities in patients  \n  with shortness of breath and/or known CAD.  \nIt is a useful test to assess LV function in individuals with:\n  hypertension and/or diabetes.\n  chest pain suspected to be due to CAD5.5 Chest radiography\nThe diagnostic yield of a chest radiograph in individuals with stable CAD is \nlow. \nWhere indicated, it may be helpful in assessing cardiac size, pulmonary \nvasculature and excluding certain non-cardiac causes of chest pain.\nIt is not a routine investigation in individuals with suspected or known stable \nCAD.\nRecommendation 2:\nIn persons with suspected CAD and having stable chest pain/angina equivalent \nof more than 2 months and undergoing non-invasive cardiac testing, it is important to determine the: Pre-Test Probability (PTP) of CAD of that individual. (Table 1, pg 22) In the  \n Euro model for assessing PTP, (Table 1, pg 22) which this writing group has  \n adopted, patients with a:   low PTP of <15% can be assumed to have no significant obstructive CAD.  \n  In these individuals, CV risk factors should be treated to target. Other causes \n  of chest pain should be looked for. \n  intermediate PTP (≥15-≤ 85%) require futher non-invasive evaluation\n  high PTP >85% can be assumed to have significant obstructive CAD and  \n  invasive  coronary angiography maybe a more appropriate investigation.\n Sensitivity and specificity of the different diagnostic modalities. (Table 6, pg 39)Key messages:\n \n In the diagnosis of CAD in patients presenting with stable chest pain, non-inva  sive tests may be:  Functional – for myocardial ischemia or\n  Anatomical – for visualization of the coronary arteries\n  It is important to determine the:\n  Pre-Test Probability (PTP) of CAD of that individual.\n  Sensitivity and specificity of the different diagnostic modalities."

The diagnostic \nperformance of these modalities is almost similar and the preference to use one \nimaging modality or the other depends on local expertise and availability.3,81\nThe choice of stress imaging technique will depend on:\n  the patient - ability to exercise, obesity, lung problems which may affect image  \n  quality. \n  local resources and expertise.\nPrior to performing the test, the following should be considered:\n  the modality is performed and interpreted by adequately trained personnel.\n  each modality of testing has its own inherent risk e.g. radiation, contrast  \n  sensitivity, bodily injury and interpretation error which should be explained to  \n  the patient.   \n46\nCTA should not be used as a screening test for CAD in the asymptomatic \nindividual. \nDue to the low prevalence of disease in most individuals undergoing health \nscreening, there tends to be too many false-positive lesions. Also, many minor lesions not causing ischemia may be found, potentially resulting in \nunnecessary downstream invasive procedures and intervention.\n6.3.3  Diagnostic Accuracy of Invasive Coronary Angiography (ICA)\nInvasive Coronary angiography has been the “gold standard” for the                 \ndiagnosis of CAD. It can detect obstructive lesions with negative remodelling \naccurately but unlike CTA, it may not be able to detect non-obstructive \nlesions with positive remodelling where the lumen diameter may be \nmaintained.\nICA is rarely necessary in stable patients with suspected CAD for the sole \npurpose of establishing the diagnosis of CAD. It is indicated, following       \nnon-invasive risk stratification, to determine the most appropriate mode of \nrevascularization. \n7.  RISK STRATIFICATION IN STABLE CAD\nThe objectives of risk stratification in stable CAD are for: \n prognosis choosing the appropriate management strategy (e.g. revascularisation in high risk  \n groups)\nAbsolute levels of what constitutes high risk and low risk are not clearly defined for \nthose with stable CAD. There are several risk assessment scores for individuals with stable CAD using different CV end points.\n1,2,64,125-128\nThe ESC guidelines define risk as:44\n high risk - annual mortality of >3%\n intermediate risk - annual mortality of 1-3%\n low risk - annual mortality of <1%Patients with stable CAD should be risk stratified using the following parameters:\n clinical evaluation \n resting ECG \n assessment of left ventricular function\n non-invasive assessment of myocardial ischemia\n where indicated, evaluation of coronary anatomy and physiological  \n assessment of the significance of the coronary lesion\n7.1 Risk Stratification of Stable CAD by Clinical Evaluation\nImportant predictors of adverse outcomes in patients with stable CAD \nare:28,63,129–142\n  increasing age  prior MI  symptoms and signs of CHF\n  pattern of occurrence of angina (recent onset or progressive)\n  severity of angina, particularly if unresponsive to therapy\n  presence of atherosclerotic disease in other vascular beds - peripheral  \n  vessels, cerebral and/or aorta  presence of CV risk factors:\n    Diabetes\n    Hypertension\n    Metabolic syndrome\n    Current smoking\n    Dyslipidaemia\n    Family history of premature CAD\n  co-existing medical conditions:\n    Diabetes \n   Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)\n  psychosocial factors \n    Depression\n    Poor social support\nThe above adverse clinical predictors especially the severity of angina help \nmodulate decisions made based on non-invasive tests of ischemia and \nwhere indicated, physiological testing by Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR).In the diagnosis of CAD, these modalities are used in individuals who have \nintermediate PTP of CAD and who:\n  are unable to exercise adequately or\n  have exercise stress ECG with equivocal results or abnormal at moderate  \n  to high workloads, or \n  have un-interpretable ECG that makes interpretation of exercise stress  \n  ECG test difficult. \nIn the presence of LBBB and ventricular paced rhythms, stress imaging \ntechniques are the non-invasive tests of choice although the diagnostic \naccuracy in these situations, is reduced.\n82 \nIn patients with multivessel disease, imaging tests especially Stress MPI can sometimes underestimate the amount of myocardial ischemia. This is because these tests are based on the principle of perfusion differences \nbetween different myocardial territories and therefore require at least one \nnon-ischemic myocardial territory as a “normal” reference to be able to detect \ninducible myocardial ischemia in another territory. If all 3 vessels are                 \nsignificantly narrowed or there is a combination of left main and multivessel CAD, uniform tracer uptake due to “balanced” ischemia may lead to a rather \nhomogeneous tracer uptake and result in a false negative result.\n83-85\n6.2.2.1  Diagnostic Accuracy of Stress echocardiogram - exercise or  \n    pharmacological stress (dobutamine)\nThis is one of the least expensive and most widely available stress imaging \ntechniques.\nAn exercise stress echocardiogram is more physiological than pharmacological \nstress and is the stress of choice wherever possible.86,87\nPharmacological stress is preferred if the patient is unable to exercise or if \nthere are wall motion abnormalities seen at rest. The pharmacological stressor \nmost often used is dobutamine. The increase in cardiac workload seen with \ndobutamine is less than that with exercise. The addition of atropine augments \nthe sensitivity of the dobutamine stress echocardiogram (DSE).86,88 With the \nuse of dobutamine, viability can also be assessed.89\nThe marker for ischemia in stress echocardiogram is absence of wall thickening and inducible new or worsening wall motion abnormalities before, during and after the stress.\n86,87 If severe, there is also a decrease in LV ejection fraction and LV \nenlargement on stress.86,87 The presence of inducible wall motion abnormalities \nimplies significant limitation of blood flow at peak stress, and usually corresponds to a functionally significant stenosis, although the anatomic severity and physiologic \nconsequences are poorly related.\n86\nDSE has good sensitivity and specificity especially in the setting of multivessel \ndisease and previous MI.81,87,90-92 The interpretation is dependent on the adequacy of \nstress. In the diagnosis of CAD, the sensitivity of DSE is reduced in the presence of \nsingle vessel disease, small vessels and distal disease.86 It has greater use in \nprognostication of CAD and for the prediction of myocardial viability.86,87,91,93\nDSE has also a long learning curve and is relatively subjective relying on the human eye for the accurate assessment of myocardial motion. With the usage of myocardial contrast agents or microbubbles, endocardial border delineation is enhanced, and \nimage quality and diagnostic accuracy improved.\n94-96\n6.2.2.2.   Diagnostic Accuracy of Myocardial Perfusion Imaging (MPI) via  \n     SPECT \nMPI most commonly uses technetium-99m sestamibi as the radiotracer and SPECT \nfor imaging. Stress can be either by exercise or pharmacological agents -                    \nadenosine, dipyridamole or dobutamine.\nIschemia is indicated by reduced radiotracer uptake during stress when compared \nwith the uptake at rest. Transient ischaemic dilatation and reduced post-stress LV \nejection fraction are important predictors of severe CAD.\nSPECT detects a relative reduction in myocardial blood volume that occurs earlier \nthan wall thickening abnormality in the ischaemic cascade. Despite this, SPECT has \nnot been shown to be significantly superior to stress echocardiography in terms of \nsensitivity and detecting the extent of CAD.97 This is due to the poorer spatial         \nresolution of SPECT (12mm) as compared to stress echocardiography (2mm).91\nIn the diagnosis of CAD, MPI with SPECT has good sensitivity and specificity.98 The \ndiagnostic image quality is affected in obese patients, as well as in women with large \nbreasts. The diagnostic accuracy is also reduced in the presence of LBBB and \nventricular pacing.82,99 Other disadvantages are the use of ionizing radiation and its \ncost.6.2.2.3  Diagnostic Accuracy of Stress Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR)\nStress CMR with the use of dobutamine can be used to look at regional wall motion \nabnormalities similar to DSE and with a similar safety profile.100-102 In studies on \npatients with high disease prevalence, stress CMR demonstrated overall good sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of CAD.\n103-105 It is particularly useful in \npatients where it is difficult to acquire good echocardiographic images due to poor \nacoustic windows. \nPerfusion CMR (with adenosine) also has good diagnostic accuracy as compared to \nMPI (nuclear studies).101,105-107 It has also demonstrated good correlation with \nPressure wire (Fractional Flow Reserve) measurements.108\n6.3.  Anatomical testing in the Diagnosis of CAD\n6.3.1  Coronary Calcium Score (CAC)\nCalcium accumulates in coronary arteries in an age-related manner. Thus, all scores \nmust be adjusted for age, as well as for sex.109 The relationship of arterial calcification, \nlike that of angiographic coronary artery stenosis, to the probability of plaque rupture is unknown. Vulnerable plaques are frequently present in the absence of calcification.\n109\nCoronary calcium score has been used to detect CAD. Most studies demonstrated a high sensitivity but a much lower specificity, and an overall predictive accuracy of ≈70% in typical CAD patient populations.\n109 CAC was found not to be superior to other \nnon-invasive diagnostic modalities for the detection of CAD.109 In general, a negative \ntest (CAC =0):109\n  makes the presence of atherosclerotic plaques, including unstable plaques,  \n  very unlikely.  is highly unlikely in the presence of significant luminal obstructive disease.\n  occurs in most patients who have angiographically normal coronary arteries.\nCAC score is more useful in CV risk assessment. (Section 7.5.1, pg 56) \nIn the emergency room, CAC may be used in the triage of patients with a negative \nresting ECG and normal cardiac biomarkers. A CAC=0 has a high sensitivity and a \nvery high negative predictive value for CAD.\n110,1116.3.2  Diagnostic Accuracy of Computed Tomography Angiography  \n   (CTA)\nCTA allows visualization of the coronary arteries non-invasively. It can also \ndetermine the extent of coronary calcification, degree of luminal stenosis, degree of luminal remodelling and plaque characteristics. \nIt is usually done as a 2-stage procedure. The first being the quantification of \ncoronary calcium (CAC) and the second is the CTA. The 64-slice detector is \nthe minimum machine requirement. It has a negative predictive value of 93-99% and sensitivity and specificity of 90-94% and 95-97%                                respectively.\n112-120 It is most useful in the diagnostic assessment of individuals \nwith low or intermediate PTP of CAD.112–115\nCareful patient selection and preparation is integral to obtaining good images. These include:  patients with adequate breath holding capabilities.\n  absence of severe obesity.\n • a favourable calcium score (<400 Agatston score) and distribution.   presence of sinus rhythm (absence of ectopics).  heart rate of less than 65 beats per minute.\nA high coronary calcium score reduces the accuracy of the test.\n112 However, \nper-segment calcification (circumferential extent of calcium - arc calcium) has \na stronger influence on diagnostic accuracy than the total calcium score.121 \nCoronary CTA interpretation is less reliable in the presence of coronary stents of <3mm.\n122 In situations where the clinical presentation suggests \nlow-to-intermediate probability for restenosis and in the presence of larger stents, coronary CTA may be a reasonable alternative to invasive                      \nangiography to rule out significant in-stent restenosis.\n123\nIt is highly accurate in the assessment of coronary artery bypass grafts.124 \nThe interpretation of native coronary vessels in post bypass patients is \nhowever, more difficult.124\nCTA may be considered in:\n  individuals with low to intermediate PTP of CAD and who have mild or  \n  equivocal changes of ischemia in the exercise stress test or stress  \n  imaging tests and who are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic with  \n  good exercise capacity.112–115\n7.2 Risk Stratification of Stable CAD by Resting ECG\nResting ECG abnormalities can predict patients at greater risk of future CV \nevents than those with a normal ECG. These abnormalities \ninclude:63,127,133,135,143-145\n evidence of prior MI\n LBBB\n left anterior hemiblock, \n Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH)\n second or third-degree AV block atrial fibrillation (AF)\n7.3 Risk Stratification of Stable CAD by Left Ventricular Function\nLV function is the strongest predictor of survival. Patients with an LVEF of \n<50 % are already at high risk of CV death (annual mortality rate of >3%) \nwithout incorporating other risk factors.\n45,46,133,134,146,147\nIn the presence of a depressed LV function, it is important to determine if this is due to infarcted (scar) tissue or viable but stunned ischemic myocardium. \nThis can be done by stress imaging techniques. In the presence of ischemic \nbut viable myocardium, coronary revascularisation can result in an                    \nimprovement in LV function and survival.\n148\n7.4 Risk Stratification of Stable CAD by Non-invasive Testing \nNon-invasive tests provide useful information for prognostication. (Table 2, \npg 24) A negative test carries a good prognosis but the clinical evaluation \n(e.g. age, ability to exercise, exercise duration, co-morbidity such as \ndiabetes, CKD etc) and LV function should also be considered when              \nassessing CV risk. \nSmall imaging sub studies have shown mixed results when looking at CV \noutcomes in individuals with moderate to severe ischemia treated with \nrevascularization as compared to OMT.149–152 Two large clinical trials have not \nshown any advantage of revascularization as compared to OMT in these patients.\n76,153 In individuals with depressed LV function (LVEF ≤35%) CABG \ndid not reduce all-cause mortality but resulted in a reduction in CV mortality and hospitalizations.\n154 The ISCHEMIA trial is a large randomized clinical trial \nthat is currently underway specifically addressing the role of revascularisation \nversus OMT in patients with moderate to severe myocardial ischemia.155 \nIn patients with unprotected Left Main stem stenosis of > 50%, revascularisation \nby CABG has been shown to improve survival in the pivotal Coronary Artery \nSurgery Study (CASS) Registry.156  In view of this “the benefit of surgery over \nmedical treatment in patients with significant LMS stenosis (greater than 50%) is little argued.” \n157\n7.5.  Risk Stratification of Stable CAD by Anatomic testing\n \n7.5.1  Coronary Calcium (CAC) Score \nCAC scores help with CV risk stratification.158-163 (Table 8, pg 57) It guides risk \nreduction strategy, OMT and the need for further evaluation. CAC score alone was able to predict CHD risk independently of the           \nFramingham Risk Score.\n156,157 When used together with the traditional CV risk \nfactors, it had incremental value in CV risk prediction.164,165 There is a                \nsignificant correlation between CAC score and overall coronary artery         atherosclerotic plaque, with a high sensitivity >95% and a high negative \npredictive value of >95%.\n109,166,167 The CAC score was found to be highly \npredictive of CV risk in 4 ethnic groups - white, black, Hispanic, and \nChinese.168 \nPersons both asymptomatic and symptomatic, with a calcium score =0 have \na low CV event rate and an excellent long-term survival.167,169 However the \nPTP of disease and the clinical setting should be considered when                     \ninterpreting the test result. In interpreting a CAC =0:170\n if the PTP of CAD is low (e.g. asymptomatic individuals), there is low risk  \n of CAD and a low risk of near-term coronary events. \n in older asymptomatic patients with risk factors, there is a moderate   \n increased risk of CV events.\n in persons with clinical signs and symptoms associated with an intermediate  \n to high risk of CAD, there is often associated myocardial ischemia on  \n provocative testing and a high risk of near-term coronary events.1717.5.3  Risk Stratification by Invasive Coronary Angiography (ICA)  \nICA continues to be the “gold standard” in assessing coronary anatomy \nalthough it has its limitations. It cannot detect vulnerable plaques which are in \nmost cases not severe (<50% stenosis) but have a rich lipid core. \nDespite these limitations, the extent and site of coronary lesions provide good \nprognostic indicators. The prognosis is worse if: \n46,146,147\n  the greater the number of vessels involved. • there is left main stem stenosis of >50%.  the proximal LAD is involved.\nRecent large clinical trials did not however, show any improvement in clinical \noutcomes in patients with significant stable CAD when an initial strategy of \ncoronary revascularization was compared to intensive OMT.76,153,154\nIn patients who have unprotected left main stem stenosis, CABG has been \nshown to improve survival when compared to medical therapy in the large \nCASS registry.156 Although this trial was performed before the era of current \nintensive OMT, it is considered unethical to repeat it. \nCoronary arteriography should NOT be performed in patients: \n with angina who refuse invasive diagnostic procedures.\n• who prefer to avoid coronary revascularization either by PCI or CABG.\n who are not candidates for PCI or CABG. in whom PCI/CABG will not improve quality-of-life.\n7.5.4  Risk assessment by Physiological Assessment of the functional  \n   severity of coronary lesions \nCoronary angiography is of limited value in defining the functional                   \nsignificance of coronary stenosis. Yet the most important factor related to \noutcome is the presence and extent of inducible ischemia.\n177 If a stenosis is \nnot flow-limiting, it will not cause angina and the prognosis without coronary \nintervention is excellent, with a ‘hard’ event rate (cardiac death or non-fatal \nMI) of <1% per year.175 This event rate was not reduced with PCI and \nstenting.1757.5.4.1 Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR) \nThe functional severity of coronary lesions visualized angiographically may \nbe assessed invasively, by measuring the intracoronary artery pressure or \nFractional Flow Reserve (FFR). FFR is more accurate than visual                       assessment of the significance and severity of coronary lesions.\n176 Even in \nthe presence of angiographically insignificant stenosis, lesions with low FFR showed significantly higher event rates than those with high FFR.\n178\nFFR is presently considered as the ‘gold standard’ for invasive assessment of the significance of coronary stenosis and is useful in decision making in the \nneed for coronary revascularization. This: \n84\n  takes into consideration collateral blood flow.  takes into consideration the amount of viable myocardial mass.\n  is independent of haemodynamic variations.\n  has a high reproducibility. \nFFR is indicated for all coronary artery stenosis of 50-90%, including left main \nstenosis, side branch stenosis, tandem lesions and even in the setting of      \nnon-culprit lesions in ACS.\n84,179-181 In patients with multivessel CAD, PCI \nguided by FFR results in an improved outcome irrespective of available \nnon-invasive functional test results.182-184\nFFR is calculated as the ratio of distal coronary pressure to aortic pressure \nmeasured during maximal hyperaemia with either intracoronary or                        intravenous infusion of adenosine. A normal value for FFR is 1.0 regardless \nof the status of the microcirculation. In individuals on OMT with:\n84,179-184\n • FFR >0.80 - have no improved outcomes with revascularisation.\n  FFR between >0.75 but <0.8 - have intermediate benefit with                        \n  revascularisation and management should be based on clinical  \n  judgement.  • FFR <0.75 - benefit from revascularisation. \nUse of FFR accurately identifies which coronary lesions should be                       \nrevascularized and improves outcome. \nIt is recommended that in individuals with stable CAD, FFR be used to guide \nrevascularization of lesions of intermediate severity.\n182-185\nAt present, there are ongoing studies on the use of instantaneous wave-free \nratio (iFR), a pressure-derived index of stenosis severity that is not obtained Table 8: Coronary Calcium score and CV risk*#\n \n7.5.2  Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA)\nCTA may also be used for prognostication. There is a strong predictive value \nfor mortality and major CV events independent of traditional risk \nfactors.7-9,172-174\nIn assessing prognosis, in patients with: \n • absence of any plaque the CV event rate is low - 0.24% for CV   \n  death/non-fatal MI and an annual mortality of 0.28%.7,8\n  coronary plaque but without stenosis, the mortality rate is higher but  \n  remains below 0.5%.9\n • left main stenosis or proximal triple vessel disease - the hazard ratio for    all-cause mortality is 3.70.\n7\nDespite its’ excellent predictive value, in a randomized controlled trial comparing functional testing with MPI using SPECT and CTA as initial \ndiagnostic strategies in patients with suspected CAD, there were no \ndifferences in clinical outcomes.\n59\nDue to the potential overestimation of obstructive coronary disease by CTA, \nit may be advisable to perform additional testing for the presence of ischemia \nprior to revascularization in the asymptomatic individual.175,176with the administration of a vasodilator such as adenosine.186-188 The cut-off \npoint is 0.89 when compared to 0.80 for FFR.186 The initial clinical trials \nindicate that an iFR-guided revascularization strategy was non-inferior to an \nFFR-guided revascularization strategy.187,188\nFFR may also be assessed using CT. A recent meta-analysis showed that FFR\nCT achieves a moderate diagnostic performance for non-invasive              \nidentification of ischemic lesions in stable patients with suspected or known CAD in comparison to invasive FFR measurement.\n189 This tool is not yet \nwidely available.\n7.5.4.2  Intravascular Ultrasound / Optical Coherence Tomography\nFFR provides physiological assessment of the severity of a coronary lesion, \nwhile intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and optical coherence tomography \n(OCT) allow visual assessment of the lesion. IVUS makes use of the \nminimum lumen area (MLA) as the marker for significance of coronary \nstenosis. Overall, IVUS studies showed a relatively high negative predictive \nvalue but a low positive predictive value for ischemia.190\nBoth IVUS and OCT should not be performed to determine the functional significance of a coronary lesion before intervention.\n191 These are useful in \noptimizing stent deployment and determining the size of the vessel                   undergoing stent implantation.\n7.6  Guidelines for referral to a tertiary cardiac center\nFollowing risk stratification:\nLow risk individuals  should be managed with risk factor reduction and/or \nanti anginal medications as necessary. No further intervention is required. \nIntermediate risk individuals  may be managed with risk reduction \nstrategies +/- anti anginal therapy or considered for invasive coronary \nangiogram and revascularization depending on the clinical condition and \npatient preferences."

The diagnostic \nperformance of these modalities is almost similar and the preference to use one \nimaging modality or the other depends on local expertise and availability.3,81\nThe choice of stress imaging technique will depend on:\n  the patient - ability to exercise, obesity, lung problems which may affect image  \n  quality. \n  local resources and expertise.\nPrior to performing the test, the following should be considered:\n  the modality is performed and interpreted by adequately trained personnel.\n  each modality of testing has its own inherent risk e.g. radiation, contrast  \n  sensitivity, bodily injury and interpretation error which should be explained to  \n  the patient.   \nCTA should not be used as a screening test for CAD in the asymptomatic \nindividual. \nDue to the low prevalence of disease in most individuals undergoing health \nscreening, there tends to be too many false-positive lesions. Also, many minor lesions not causing ischemia may be found, potentially resulting in \nunnecessary downstream invasive procedures and intervention.\n6.3.3  Diagnostic Accuracy of Invasive Coronary Angiography (ICA)\nInvasive Coronary angiography has been the “gold standard” for the                 \ndiagnosis of CAD. It can detect obstructive lesions with negative remodelling \naccurately but unlike CTA, it may not be able to detect non-obstructive \nlesions with positive remodelling where the lumen diameter may be \nmaintained.\nICA is rarely necessary in stable patients with suspected CAD for the sole \npurpose of establishing the diagnosis of CAD.

The diagnostic accuracy is also reduced in the presence of LBBB and \nventricular pacing.82,99 Other disadvantages are the use of ionizing radiation and its \ncost.6.2.2.3  Diagnostic Accuracy of Stress Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR)\nStress CMR with the use of dobutamine can be used to look at regional wall motion \nabnormalities similar to DSE and with a similar safety profile.100-102 In studies on \npatients with high disease prevalence, stress CMR demonstrated overall good sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of CAD.\n103-105 It is particularly useful in \npatients where it is difficult to acquire good echocardiographic images due to poor \nacoustic windows. \nPerfusion CMR (with adenosine) also has good diagnostic accuracy as compared to \nMPI (nuclear studies).101,105-107 It has also demonstrated good correlation with \nPressure wire (Fractional Flow Reserve) measurements.108\n6.3.  Anatomical testing in the Diagnosis of CAD\n6.3.1  Coronary Calcium Score (CAC)\nCalcium accumulates in coronary arteries in an age-related manner. Thus, all scores \nmust be adjusted for age, as well as for sex.109 The relationship of arterial calcification, \nlike that of angiographic coronary artery stenosis, to the probability of plaque rupture is unknown. Vulnerable plaques are frequently present in the absence of calcification.\n109\nCoronary calcium score has been used to detect CAD. Most studies demonstrated a high sensitivity but a much lower specificity, and an overall predictive accuracy of ≈70% in typical CAD patient populations.\n109 CAC was found not to be superior to other \nnon-invasive diagnostic modalities for the detection of CAD.109 In general, a negative \ntest (CAC =0):109\n  makes the presence of atherosclerotic plaques, including unstable plaques,  \n  very unlikely.  is highly unlikely in the presence of significant luminal obstructive disease.\n  occurs in most patients who have angiographically normal coronary arteries.\nCAC score is more useful in CV risk assessment. (Section 7.5.1, pg 56) \nIn the emergency room, CAC may be used in the triage of patients with a negative \nresting ECG and normal cardiac biomarkers. A CAC=0 has a high sensitivity and a \nvery high negative predictive value for CAD.\n110,1116.3.2  Diagnostic Accuracy of Computed Tomography Angiography  \n   (CTA)\nCTA allows visualization of the coronary arteries non-invasively. It can also \ndetermine the extent of coronary calcification, degree of luminal stenosis, degree of luminal remodelling and plaque characteristics. \nIt is usually done as a 2-stage procedure. The first being the quantification of \ncoronary calcium (CAC) and the second is the CTA. The 64-slice detector is \nthe minimum machine requirement. It has a negative predictive value of 93-99% and sensitivity and specificity of 90-94% and 95-97%                                respectively.\n112-120 It is most useful in the diagnostic assessment of individuals \nwith low or intermediate PTP of CAD.112–115\nCareful patient selection and preparation is integral to obtaining good images. These include:  patients with adequate breath holding capabilities.\n  absence of severe obesity.\n • a favourable calcium score (<400 Agatston score) and distribution.   presence of sinus rhythm (absence of ectopics).  heart rate of less than 65 beats per minute.\nA high coronary calcium score reduces the accuracy of the test.\n112 However, \nper-segment calcification (circumferential extent of calcium - arc calcium) has \na stronger influence on diagnostic accuracy than the total calcium score.121 \nCoronary CTA interpretation is less reliable in the presence of coronary stents of <3mm.\n122 In situations where the clinical presentation suggests \nlow-to-intermediate probability for restenosis and in the presence of larger stents, coronary CTA may be a reasonable alternative to invasive                      \nangiography to rule out significant in-stent restenosis.\n123\nIt is highly accurate in the assessment of coronary artery bypass grafts.124 \nThe interpretation of native coronary vessels in post bypass patients is \nhowever, more difficult.124\nCTA may be considered in:\n  individuals with low to intermediate PTP of CAD and who have mild or  \n  equivocal changes of ischemia in the exercise stress test or stress  \n  imaging tests and who are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic with  \n  good exercise capacity.112–115\n7.2 Risk Stratification of Stable CAD by Resting ECG\nResting ECG abnormalities can predict patients at greater risk of future CV \nevents than those with a normal ECG. These abnormalities \ninclude:63,127,133,135,143-145\n evidence of prior MI\n LBBB\n left anterior hemiblock, \n Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH)\n second or third-degree AV block atrial fibrillation (AF)\n7.3 Risk Stratification of Stable CAD by Left Ventricular Function\nLV function is the strongest predictor of survival. Patients with an LVEF of \n<50 % are already at high risk of CV death (annual mortality rate of >3%) \nwithout incorporating other risk factors.\n45,46,133,134,146,147\nIn the presence of a depressed LV function, it is important to determine if this is due to infarcted (scar) tissue or viable but stunned ischemic myocardium. \nThis can be done by stress imaging techniques. In the presence of ischemic \nbut viable myocardium, coronary revascularisation can result in an                    \nimprovement in LV function and survival.\n148\n7.4 Risk Stratification of Stable CAD by Non-invasive Testing \nNon-invasive tests provide useful information for prognostication. (Table 2, \npg 24) A negative test carries a good prognosis but the clinical evaluation \n(e.g. age, ability to exercise, exercise duration, co-morbidity such as \ndiabetes, CKD etc) and LV function should also be considered when              \nassessing CV risk. \nSmall imaging sub studies have shown mixed results when looking at CV \noutcomes in individuals with moderate to severe ischemia treated with \nrevascularization as compared to OMT.149–152 Two large clinical trials have not \nshown any advantage of revascularization as compared to OMT in these patients.\n76,153 In individuals with depressed LV function (LVEF ≤35%) CABG \ndid not reduce all-cause mortality but resulted in a reduction in CV mortality and hospitalizations.\n154 The ISCHEMIA trial is a large randomized clinical trial \nthat is currently underway specifically addressing the role of revascularisation \nversus OMT in patients with moderate to severe myocardial ischemia.155 \nIn patients with unprotected Left Main stem stenosis of > 50%, revascularisation \nby CABG has been shown to improve survival in the pivotal Coronary Artery \nSurgery Study (CASS) Registry.156  In view of this “the benefit of surgery over \nmedical treatment in patients with significant LMS stenosis (greater than 50%) is little argued.” \n157\n7.5.  Risk Stratification of Stable CAD by Anatomic testing\n \n7.5.1  Coronary Calcium (CAC) Score \nCAC scores help with CV risk stratification.158-163 (Table 8, pg 57) It guides risk \nreduction strategy, OMT and the need for further evaluation. CAC score alone was able to predict CHD risk independently of the           \nFramingham Risk Score.\n156,157 When used together with the traditional CV risk \nfactors, it had incremental value in CV risk prediction.164,165 There is a                \nsignificant correlation between CAC score and overall coronary artery         atherosclerotic plaque, with a high sensitivity >95% and a high negative \npredictive value of >95%.\n109,166,167 The CAC score was found to be highly \npredictive of CV risk in 4 ethnic groups - white, black, Hispanic, and \nChinese.168 \nPersons both asymptomatic and symptomatic, with a calcium score =0 have \na low CV event rate and an excellent long-term survival.167,169 However the \nPTP of disease and the clinical setting should be considered when                     \ninterpreting the test result. In interpreting a CAC =0:170\n if the PTP of CAD is low (e.g. asymptomatic individuals), there is low risk  \n of CAD and a low risk of near-term coronary events. \n in older asymptomatic patients with risk factors, there is a moderate   \n increased risk of CV events.\n in persons with clinical signs and symptoms associated with an intermediate  \n to high risk of CAD, there is often associated myocardial ischemia on  \n provocative testing and a high risk of near-term coronary events.1717.5.3  Risk Stratification by Invasive Coronary Angiography (ICA)  \nICA continues to be the “gold standard” in assessing coronary anatomy \nalthough it has its limitations. It cannot detect vulnerable plaques which are in \nmost cases not severe (<50% stenosis) but have a rich lipid core. \nDespite these limitations, the extent and site of coronary lesions provide good \nprognostic indicators. The prognosis is worse if: \n46,146,147\n  the greater the number of vessels involved. • there is left main stem stenosis of >50%.  the proximal LAD is involved.\nRecent large clinical trials did not however, show any improvement in clinical \noutcomes in patients with significant stable CAD when an initial strategy of \ncoronary revascularization was compared to intensive OMT.\n76,153,154\nIn patients who have unprotected left main stem stenosis, CABG has been shown to improve survival when compared to medical therapy in the large \nCASS registry.\n156 Although this trial was performed before the era of current \nintensive OMT, it is considered unethical to repeat it. \nCoronary arteriography should NOT be performed in patients: \n with angina who refuse invasive diagnostic procedures.\n• who prefer to avoid coronary revascularization either by PCI or CABG.\n who are not candidates for PCI or CABG. in whom PCI/CABG will not improve quality-of-life.\n7.5.4  Risk assessment by Physiological Assessment of the functional  \n   severity of coronary lesions \nCoronary angiography is of limited value in defining the functional                   \nsignificance of coronary stenosis. Yet the most important factor related to \noutcome is the presence and extent of inducible ischemia.\n177 If a stenosis is \nnot flow-limiting, it will not cause angina and the prognosis without coronary \nintervention is excellent, with a ‘hard’ event rate (cardiac death or non-fatal \nMI) of <1% per year.175 This event rate was not reduced with PCI and \nstenting.1757.5.4.1 Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR) \nThe functional severity of coronary lesions visualized angiographically may \nbe assessed invasively, by measuring the intracoronary artery pressure or \nFractional Flow Reserve (FFR). FFR is more accurate than visual                       assessment of the significance and severity of coronary lesions.\n176 Even in \nthe presence of angiographically insignificant stenosis, lesions with low FFR showed significantly higher event rates than those with high FFR.\n178\nFFR is presently considered as the ‘gold standard’ for invasive assessment of the significance of coronary stenosis and is useful in decision making in the \nneed for coronary revascularization. This: \n84\n  takes into consideration collateral blood flow.  takes into consideration the amount of viable myocardial mass.\n  is independent of haemodynamic variations.\n  has a high reproducibility. \nFFR is indicated for all coronary artery stenosis of 50-90%, including left main \nstenosis, side branch stenosis, tandem lesions and even in the setting of      \nnon-culprit lesions in ACS.\n84,179-181 In patients with multivessel CAD, PCI \nguided by FFR results in an improved outcome irrespective of available \nnon-invasive functional test results.182-184\nFFR is calculated as the ratio of distal coronary pressure to aortic pressure \nmeasured during maximal hyperaemia with either intracoronary or                        intravenous infusion of adenosine. A normal value for FFR is 1.0 regardless \nof the status of the microcirculation. In individuals on OMT with:\n84,179-184\n • FFR >0.80 - have no improved outcomes with revascularisation.\n  FFR between >0.75 but <0.8 - have intermediate benefit with                        \n  revascularisation and management should be based on clinical  \n  judgement.  • FFR <0.75 - benefit from revascularisation. \nUse of FFR accurately identifies which coronary lesions should be                       \nrevascularized and improves outcome. \nIt is recommended that in individuals with stable CAD, FFR be used to guide \nrevascularization of lesions of intermediate severity.\n182-185\nAt present, there are ongoing studies on the use of instantaneous wave-free \nratio (iFR), a pressure-derived index of stenosis severity that is not obtained I, B\nTable 8: Coronary Calcium score and CV risk*#\n \n7.5.2  Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA)\nCTA may also be used for prognostication. There is a strong predictive value \nfor mortality and major CV events independent of traditional risk \nfactors.7-9,172-174\nIn assessing prognosis, in patients with: \n • absence of any plaque the CV event rate is low - 0.24% for CV   \n  death/non-fatal MI and an annual mortality of 0.28%.7,8\n  coronary plaque but without stenosis, the mortality rate is higher but  \n  remains below 0.5%.9\n • left main stenosis or proximal triple vessel disease - the hazard ratio for    all-cause mortality is 3.70.\n7\nDespite its’ excellent predictive value, in a randomized controlled trial comparing functional testing with MPI using SPECT and CTA as initial \ndiagnostic strategies in patients with suspected CAD, there were no \ndifferences in clinical outcomes.\n59\nDue to the potential overestimation of obstructive coronary disease by CTA, \nit may be advisable to perform additional testing for the presence of ischemia \nprior to revascularization in the asymptomatic individual.175,176with the administration of a vasodilator such as adenosine.186-188 The cut-off \npoint is 0.89 when compared to 0.80 for FFR.186 The initial clinical trials \nindicate that an iFR-guided revascularization strategy was non-inferior to an \nFFR-guided revascularization strategy.187,188\nFFR may also be assessed using CT. A recent meta-analysis showed that FFR\nCT achieves a moderate diagnostic performance for non-invasive              \nidentification of ischemic lesions in stable patients with suspected or known CAD in comparison to invasive FFR measurement.\n189 This tool is not yet \nwidely available.\n7.5.4.2  Intravascular Ultrasound / Optical Coherence Tomography\nFFR provides physiological assessment of the severity of a coronary lesion, \nwhile intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and optical coherence tomography \n(OCT) allow visual assessment of the lesion. IVUS makes use of the \nminimum lumen area (MLA) as the marker for significance of coronary \nstenosis. Overall, IVUS studies showed a relatively high negative predictive \nvalue but a low positive predictive value for ischemia.190\nBoth IVUS and OCT should not be performed to determine the functional significance of a coronary lesion before intervention.\n191 These are useful in \noptimizing stent deployment and determining the size of the vessel                   undergoing stent implantation.\n7.6  Guidelines for referral to a tertiary cardiac center\nFollowing risk stratification:\nLow risk individuals  should be managed with risk factor reduction and/or \nanti anginal medications as necessary. No further intervention is required. \nIntermediate risk individuals  may be managed with risk reduction \nstrategies +/- anti anginal therapy or considered for invasive coronary \nangiogram and revascularization depending on the clinical condition and \npatient preferences."

The diagnostic \nperformance of these modalities is almost similar and the preference to use one \nimaging modality or the other depends on local expertise and availability.3,81\nThe choice of stress imaging technique will depend on:\n  the patient - ability to exercise, obesity, lung problems which may affect image  \n  quality. \n  local resources and expertise.\nPrior to performing the test, the following should be considered:\n  the modality is performed and interpreted by adequately trained personnel.\n  each modality of testing has its own inherent risk e.g. radiation, contrast  \n  sensitivity, bodily injury and interpretation error which should be explained to  \n  the patient.   \nCTA should not be used as a screening test for CAD in the asymptomatic \nindividual. \nDue to the low prevalence of disease in most individuals undergoing health \nscreening, there tends to be too many false-positive lesions. Also, many minor lesions not causing ischemia may be found, potentially resulting in \nunnecessary downstream invasive procedures and intervention.\n6.3.3  Diagnostic Accuracy of Invasive Coronary Angiography (ICA)\nInvasive Coronary angiography has been the “gold standard” for the                 \ndiagnosis of CAD. It can detect obstructive lesions with negative remodelling \naccurately but unlike CTA, it may not be able to detect non-obstructive \nlesions with positive remodelling where the lumen diameter may be \nmaintained.\nICA is rarely necessary in stable patients with suspected CAD for the sole \npurpose of establishing the diagnosis of CAD. It is indicated, following       \nnon-invasive risk stratification, to determine the most appropriate mode of \nrevascularization. \n7.  RISK STRATIFICATION IN STABLE CAD\nThe objectives of risk stratification in stable CAD are for: \n prognosis choosing the appropriate management strategy (e.g. revascularisation in high risk  \n groups)\nAbsolute levels of what constitutes high risk and low risk are not clearly defined for \nthose with stable CAD. There are several risk assessment scores for individuals with stable CAD using different CV end points.\n1,2,64,125-128\nThe ESC guidelines define risk as:44\n high risk - annual mortality of >3%\n intermediate risk - annual mortality of 1-3%\n low risk - annual mortality of <1%Patients with stable CAD should be risk stratified using the following parameters:\n clinical evaluation \n resting ECG \n assessment of left ventricular function\n non-invasive assessment of myocardial ischemia\n where indicated, evaluation of coronary anatomy and physiological  \n assessment of the significance of the coronary lesion\n7.1 Risk Stratification of Stable CAD by Clinical Evaluation\nImportant predictors of adverse outcomes in patients with stable CAD \nare:28,63,129–142\n  increasing age  prior MI  symptoms and signs of CHF\n  pattern of occurrence of angina (recent onset or progressive)\n  severity of angina, particularly if unresponsive to therapy\n  presence of atherosclerotic disease in other vascular beds - peripheral  \n  vessels, cerebral and/or aorta  presence of CV risk factors:\n    Diabetes\n    Hypertension\n    Metabolic syndrome\n    Current smoking\n    Dyslipidaemia\n    Family history of premature CAD\n  co-existing medical conditions:\n    Diabetes \n   Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)\n  psychosocial factors \n    Depression\n    Poor social support\nThe above adverse clinical predictors especially the severity of angina help \nmodulate decisions made based on non-invasive tests of ischemia and \nwhere indicated, physiological testing by Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR).In the diagnosis of CAD, these modalities are used in individuals who have \nintermediate PTP of CAD and who:\n  are unable to exercise adequately or\n  have exercise stress ECG with equivocal results or abnormal at moderate  \n  to high workloads, or \n  have un-interpretable ECG that makes interpretation of exercise stress  \n  ECG test difficult. \nIn the presence of LBBB and ventricular paced rhythms, stress imaging \ntechniques are the non-invasive tests of choice although the diagnostic \naccuracy in these situations, is reduced.\n82 \nIn patients with multivessel disease, imaging tests especially Stress MPI can sometimes underestimate the amount of myocardial ischemia. This is because these tests are based on the principle of perfusion differences \nbetween different myocardial territories and therefore require at least one \nnon-ischemic myocardial territory as a “normal” reference to be able to detect \ninducible myocardial ischemia in another territory. If all 3 vessels are                 \nsignificantly narrowed or there is a combination of left main and multivessel CAD, uniform tracer uptake due to “balanced” ischemia may lead to a rather \nhomogeneous tracer uptake and result in a false negative result.\n83-85\n6.2.2.1  Diagnostic Accuracy of Stress echocardiogram - exercise or  \n    pharmacological stress (dobutamine)\nThis is one of the least expensive and most widely available stress imaging \ntechniques.\nAn exercise stress echocardiogram is more physiological than pharmacological \nstress and is the stress of choice wherever possible.86,87\nPharmacological stress is preferred if the patient is unable to exercise or if \nthere are wall motion abnormalities seen at rest. The pharmacological stressor \nmost often used is dobutamine. The increase in cardiac workload seen with \ndobutamine is less than that with exercise. The addition of atropine augments \nthe sensitivity of the dobutamine stress echocardiogram (DSE).86,88 With the \nuse of dobutamine, viability can also be assessed.89\nThe marker for ischemia in stress echocardiogram is absence of wall thickening and inducible new or worsening wall motion abnormalities before, during and after the stress.86,87 If severe, there is also a decrease in LV ejection fraction and LV \nenlargement on stress.86,87 The presence of inducible wall motion abnormalities \nimplies significant limitation of blood flow at peak stress, and usually corresponds to \na functionally significant stenosis, although the anatomic severity and physiologic \nconsequences are poorly related.86\nDSE has good sensitivity and specificity especially in the setting of multivessel \ndisease and previous MI.81,87,90-92 The interpretation is dependent on the adequacy of \nstress. In the diagnosis of CAD, the sensitivity of DSE is reduced in the presence of \nsingle vessel disease, small vessels and distal disease.86 It has greater use in \nprognostication of CAD and for the prediction of myocardial viability.86,87,91,93\nDSE has also a long learning curve and is relatively subjective relying on the human eye for the accurate assessment of myocardial motion. With the usage of myocardial contrast agents or microbubbles, endocardial border delineation is enhanced, and \nimage quality and diagnostic accuracy improved.\n94-96\n6.2.2.2.   Diagnostic Accuracy of Myocardial Perfusion Imaging (MPI) via  \n     SPECT \nMPI most commonly uses technetium-99m sestamibi as the radiotracer and SPECT \nfor imaging. Stress can be either by exercise or pharmacological agents -                    \nadenosine, dipyridamole or dobutamine.\nIschemia is indicated by reduced radiotracer uptake during stress when compared \nwith the uptake at rest. Transient ischaemic dilatation and reduced post-stress LV \nejection fraction are important predictors of severe CAD.\nSPECT detects a relative reduction in myocardial blood volume that occurs earlier \nthan wall thickening abnormality in the ischaemic cascade. Despite this, SPECT has \nnot been shown to be significantly superior to stress echocardiography in terms of \nsensitivity and detecting the extent of CAD.97 This is due to the poorer spatial         \nresolution of SPECT (12mm) as compared to stress echocardiography (2mm).91\nIn the diagnosis of CAD, MPI with SPECT has good sensitivity and specificity.98 The \ndiagnostic image quality is affected in obese patients, as well as in women with large \nbreasts. The diagnostic accuracy is also reduced in the presence of LBBB and \nventricular pacing.82,99 Other disadvantages are the use of ionizing radiation and its \ncost.6.2.2.3  Diagnostic Accuracy of Stress Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR)\nStress CMR with the use of dobutamine can be used to look at regional wall motion \nabnormalities similar to DSE and with a similar safety profile.100-102 In studies on \npatients with high disease prevalence, stress CMR demonstrated overall good \nsensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of CAD.103-105 It is particularly useful in \npatients where it is difficult to acquire good echocardiographic images due to poor \nacoustic windows. \nPerfusion CMR (with adenosine) also has good diagnostic accuracy as compared to \nMPI (nuclear studies).101,105-107 It has also demonstrated good correlation with \nPressure wire (Fractional Flow Reserve) measurements.108\n6.3.

Yet the most important factor related to \noutcome is the presence and extent of inducible ischemia.\n177 If a stenosis is \nnot flow-limiting, it will not cause angina and the prognosis without coronary \nintervention is excellent, with a ‘hard’ event rate (cardiac death or non-fatal \nMI) of <1% per year.175 This event rate was not reduced with PCI and \nstenting.1757.5.4.1 Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR) \nThe functional severity of coronary lesions visualized angiographically may \nbe assessed invasively, by measuring the intracoronary artery pressure or \nFractional Flow Reserve (FFR). FFR is more accurate than visual                       assessment of the significance and severity of coronary lesions.\n176 Even in \nthe presence of angiographically insignificant stenosis, lesions with low FFR showed significantly higher event rates than those with high FFR.\n178\nFFR is presently considered as the ‘gold standard’ for invasive assessment of the significance of coronary stenosis and is useful in decision making in the \nneed for coronary revascularization. This: \n84\n  takes into consideration collateral blood flow.  takes into consideration the amount of viable myocardial mass.\n  is independent of haemodynamic variations.\n  has a high reproducibility. \nFFR is indicated for all coronary artery stenosis of 50-90%, including left main \nstenosis, side branch stenosis, tandem lesions and even in the setting of      \nnon-culprit lesions in ACS.\n84,179-181 In patients with multivessel CAD, PCI \nguided by FFR results in an improved outcome irrespective of available \nnon-invasive functional test results.182-184\nFFR is calculated as the ratio of distal coronary pressure to aortic pressure \nmeasured during maximal hyperaemia with either intracoronary or                        intravenous infusion of adenosine. A normal value for FFR is 1.0 regardless \nof the status of the microcirculation. In individuals on OMT with:\n84,179-184\n • FFR >0.80 - have no improved outcomes with revascularisation.\n  FFR between >0.75 but <0.8 - have intermediate benefit with                        \n  revascularisation and management should be based on clinical  \n  judgement.  • FFR <0.75 - benefit from revascularisation. \nUse of FFR accurately identifies which coronary lesions should be                       \nrevascularized and improves outcome. \nIt is recommended that in individuals with stable CAD, FFR be used to guide \nrevascularization of lesions of intermediate severity.\n182-185\nAt present, there are ongoing studies on the use of instantaneous wave-free \nratio (iFR), a pressure-derived index of stenosis severity that is not obtained Table 8: Coronary Calcium score and CV risk*#\n \n7.5.2  Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA)\nCTA may also be used for prognostication. There is a strong predictive value \nfor mortality and major CV events independent of traditional risk \nfactors.7-9,172-174\nIn assessing prognosis, in patients with: \n • absence of any plaque the CV event rate is low - 0.24% for CV   \n  death/non-fatal MI and an annual mortality of 0.28%.7,8\n  coronary plaque but without stenosis, the mortality rate is higher but  \n  remains below 0.5%.9\n • left main stenosis or proximal triple vessel disease - the hazard ratio for    all-cause mortality is 3.70.\n7\nDespite its’ excellent predictive value, in a randomized controlled trial comparing functional testing with MPI using SPECT and CTA as initial \ndiagnostic strategies in patients with suspected CAD, there were no \ndifferences in clinical outcomes.\n59\nDue to the potential overestimation of obstructive coronary disease by CTA, \nit may be advisable to perform additional testing for the presence of ischemia \nprior to revascularization in the asymptomatic individual.175,176with the administration of a vasodilator such as adenosine.186-188 The cut-off \npoint is 0.89 when compared to 0.80 for FFR.186 The initial clinical trials \nindicate that an iFR-guided revascularization strategy was non-inferior to an \nFFR-guided revascularization strategy.187,188\nFFR may also be assessed using CT. A recent meta-analysis showed that FFR\nCT achieves a moderate diagnostic performance for non-invasive              \nidentification of ischemic lesions in stable patients with suspected or known CAD in comparison to invasive FFR measurement.\n189 This tool is not yet \nwidely available.\n7.5.4.2  Intravascular Ultrasound / Optical Coherence Tomography\nFFR provides physiological assessment of the severity of a coronary lesion, \nwhile intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and optical coherence tomography \n(OCT) allow visual assessment of the lesion. IVUS makes use of the \nminimum lumen area (MLA) as the marker for significance of coronary \nstenosis. Overall, IVUS studies showed a relatively high negative predictive \nvalue but a low positive predictive value for ischemia.190\nBoth IVUS and OCT should not be performed to determine the functional significance of a coronary lesion before intervention.\n191 These are useful in \noptimizing stent deployment and determining the size of the vessel                   undergoing stent implantation.\n7.6  Guidelines for referral to a tertiary cardiac center\nFollowing risk stratification:\nLow risk individuals  should be managed with risk factor reduction and/or \nanti anginal medications as necessary.

The diagnostic \nperformance of these modalities is almost similar and the preference to use one \nimaging modality or the other depends on local expertise and availability.3,81\nThe choice of stress imaging technique will depend on:\n  the patient - ability to exercise, obesity, lung problems which may affect image  \n  quality. \n  local resources and expertise.\nPrior to performing the test, the following should be considered:\n  the modality is performed and interpreted by adequately trained personnel.\n  each modality of testing has its own inherent risk e.g. radiation, contrast  \n  sensitivity, bodily injury and interpretation error which should be explained to  \n  the patient.   \nCTA should not be used as a screening test for CAD in the asymptomatic \nindividual. \nDue to the low prevalence of disease in most individuals undergoing health \nscreening, there tends to be too many false-positive lesions. Also, many minor lesions not causing ischemia may be found, potentially resulting in \nunnecessary downstream invasive procedures and intervention.\n6.3.3  Diagnostic Accuracy of Invasive Coronary Angiography (ICA)\nInvasive Coronary angiography has been the “gold standard” for the                 \ndiagnosis of CAD. It can detect obstructive lesions with negative remodelling \naccurately but unlike CTA, it may not be able to detect non-obstructive \nlesions with positive remodelling where the lumen diameter may be \nmaintained.\nICA is rarely necessary in stable patients with suspected CAD for the sole \npurpose of establishing the diagnosis of CAD. It is indicated, following       \nnon-invasive risk stratification, to determine the most appropriate mode of \nrevascularization. \n7.  RISK STRATIFICATION IN STABLE CAD\nThe objectives of risk stratification in stable CAD are for: \n prognosis choosing the appropriate management strategy (e.g. revascularisation in high risk  \n groups)\nAbsolute levels of what constitutes high risk and low risk are not clearly defined for \nthose with stable CAD. There are several risk assessment scores for individuals with stable CAD using different CV end points.\n1,2,64,125-128\nThe ESC guidelines define risk as:44\n high risk - annual mortality of >3%\n intermediate risk - annual mortality of 1-3%\n low risk - annual mortality of <1%Patients with stable CAD should be risk stratified using the following parameters:\n clinical evaluation \n resting ECG \n assessment of left ventricular function\n non-invasive assessment of myocardial ischemia\n where indicated, evaluation of coronary anatomy and physiological  \n assessment of the significance of the coronary lesion\n7.1 Risk Stratification of Stable CAD by Clinical Evaluation\nImportant predictors of adverse outcomes in patients with stable CAD \nare:28,63,129–142\n  increasing age  prior MI  symptoms and signs of CHF\n  pattern of occurrence of angina (recent onset or progressive)\n  severity of angina, particularly if unresponsive to therapy\n  presence of atherosclerotic disease in other vascular beds - peripheral  \n  vessels, cerebral and/or aorta  presence of CV risk factors:\n    Diabetes\n    Hypertension\n    Metabolic syndrome\n    Current smoking\n    Dyslipidaemia\n    Family history of premature CAD\n  co-existing medical conditions:\n    Diabetes \n   Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)\n  psychosocial factors \n    Depression\n    Poor social support\nThe above adverse clinical predictors especially the severity of angina help \nmodulate decisions made based on non-invasive tests of ischemia and \nwhere indicated, physiological testing by Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR).In the diagnosis of CAD, these modalities are used in individuals who have \nintermediate PTP of CAD and who:\n  are unable to exercise adequately or\n  have exercise stress ECG with equivocal results or abnormal at moderate  \n  to high workloads, or \n  have un-interpretable ECG that makes interpretation of exercise stress  \n  ECG test difficult. \nIn the presence of LBBB and ventricular paced rhythms, stress imaging \ntechniques are the non-invasive tests of choice although the diagnostic \naccuracy in these situations, is reduced.\n82 \nIn patients with multivessel disease, imaging tests especially Stress MPI can sometimes underestimate the amount of myocardial ischemia. This is because these tests are based on the principle of perfusion differences \nbetween different myocardial territories and therefore require at least one \nnon-ischemic myocardial territory as a “normal” reference to be able to detect \ninducible myocardial ischemia in another territory. If all 3 vessels are                 \nsignificantly narrowed or there is a combination of left main and multivessel CAD, uniform tracer uptake due to “balanced” ischemia may lead to a rather \nhomogeneous tracer uptake and result in a false negative result.\n83-85\n6.2.2.1  Diagnostic Accuracy of Stress echocardiogram - exercise or  \n    pharmacological stress (dobutamine)\nThis is one of the least expensive and most widely available stress imaging \ntechniques.\nAn exercise stress echocardiogram is more physiological than pharmacological \nstress and is the stress of choice wherever possible.86,87\nPharmacological stress is preferred if the patient is unable to exercise or if \nthere are wall motion abnormalities seen at rest. The pharmacological stressor \nmost often used is dobutamine. The increase in cardiac workload seen with \ndobutamine is less than that with exercise. The addition of atropine augments \nthe sensitivity of the dobutamine stress echocardiogram (DSE).86,88 With the \nuse of dobutamine, viability can also be assessed.89\nThe marker for ischemia in stress echocardiogram is absence of wall thickening and inducible new or worsening wall motion abnormalities before, during and after the stress.\n86,87 If severe, there is also a decrease in LV ejection fraction and LV \nenlargement on stress.86,87 The presence of inducible wall motion abnormalities \nimplies significant limitation of blood flow at peak stress, and usually corresponds to a functionally significant stenosis, although the anatomic severity and physiologic \nconsequences are poorly related.\n86\nDSE has good sensitivity and specificity especially in the setting of multivessel \ndisease and previous MI.81,87,90-92 The interpretation is dependent on the adequacy of \nstress. In the diagnosis of CAD, the sensitivity of DSE is reduced in the presence of \nsingle vessel disease, small vessels and distal disease.86 It has greater use in \nprognostication of CAD and for the prediction of myocardial viability.86,87,91,93\nDSE has also a long learning curve and is relatively subjective relying on the human eye for the accurate assessment of myocardial motion. With the usage of myocardial contrast agents or microbubbles, endocardial border delineation is enhanced, and \nimage quality and diagnostic accuracy improved.\n94-96\n6.2.2.2.   Diagnostic Accuracy of Myocardial Perfusion Imaging (MPI) via  \n     SPECT \nMPI most commonly uses technetium-99m sestamibi as the radiotracer and SPECT \nfor imaging. Stress can be either by exercise or pharmacological agents -                    \nadenosine, dipyridamole or dobutamine.\nIschemia is indicated by reduced radiotracer uptake during stress when compared \nwith the uptake at rest. Transient ischaemic dilatation and reduced post-stress LV \nejection fraction are important predictors of severe CAD.\nSPECT detects a relative reduction in myocardial blood volume that occurs earlier \nthan wall thickening abnormality in the ischaemic cascade. Despite this, SPECT has \nnot been shown to be significantly superior to stress echocardiography in terms of \nsensitivity and detecting the extent of CAD.97 This is due to the poorer spatial         \nresolution of SPECT (12mm) as compared to stress echocardiography (2mm).91\nIn the diagnosis of CAD, MPI with SPECT has good sensitivity and specificity.98 The \ndiagnostic image quality is affected in obese patients, as well as in women with large \nbreasts. The diagnostic accuracy is also reduced in the presence of LBBB and \nventricular pacing.82,99 Other disadvantages are the use of ionizing radiation and its \ncost.6.2.2.3  Diagnostic Accuracy of Stress Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR)\nStress CMR with the use of dobutamine can be used to look at regional wall motion \nabnormalities similar to DSE and with a similar safety profile.100-102 In studies on \npatients with high disease prevalence, stress CMR demonstrated overall good \nsensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of CAD.103-105 It is particularly useful in \npatients where it is difficult to acquire good echocardiographic images due to poor \nacoustic windows. \nPerfusion CMR (with adenosine) also has good diagnostic accuracy as compared to \nMPI (nuclear studies).101,105-107 It has also demonstrated good correlation with \nPressure wire (Fractional Flow Reserve) measurements.108\n6.3.  Anatomical testing in the Diagnosis of CAD\n6.3.1  Coronary Calcium Score (CAC)\nCalcium accumulates in coronary arteries in an age-related manner. Thus, all scores \nmust be adjusted for age, as well as for sex.109 The relationship of arterial calcification, \nlike that of angiographic coronary artery stenosis, to the probability of plaque rupture is unknown. Vulnerable plaques are frequently present in the absence of calcification.\n109\nCoronary calcium score has been used to detect CAD. Most studies demonstrated a high sensitivity but a much lower specificity, and an overall predictive accuracy of ≈70% in typical CAD patient populations.\n109 CAC was found not to be superior to other \nnon-invasive diagnostic modalities for the detection of CAD.109 In general, a negative \ntest (CAC =0):109\n  makes the presence of atherosclerotic plaques, including unstable plaques,  \n  very unlikely.  is highly unlikely in the presence of significant luminal obstructive disease.\n  occurs in most patients who have angiographically normal coronary arteries.\nCAC score is more useful in CV risk assessment. (Section 7.5.1, pg 56) \nIn the emergency room, CAC may be used in the triage of patients with a negative \nresting ECG and normal cardiac biomarkers. A CAC=0 has a high sensitivity and a \nvery high negative predictive value for CAD.\n110,1116.3.2  Diagnostic Accuracy of Computed Tomography Angiography  \n   (CTA)\nCTA allows visualization of the coronary arteries non-invasively. It can also \ndetermine the extent of coronary calcification, degree of luminal stenosis, degree of luminal remodelling and plaque characteristics. \nIt is usually done as a 2-stage procedure. The first being the quantification of \ncoronary calcium (CAC) and the second is the CTA. The 64-slice detector is \nthe minimum machine requirement. It has a negative predictive value of 93-99% and sensitivity and specificity of 90-94% and 95-97%                                respectively.\n112-120 It is most useful in the diagnostic assessment of individuals \nwith low or intermediate PTP of CAD.112–115\nCareful patient selection and preparation is integral to obtaining good images. These include:  patients with adequate breath holding capabilities.\n  absence of severe obesity.\n • a favourable calcium score (<400 Agatston score) and distribution.   presence of sinus rhythm (absence of ectopics).  heart rate of less than 65 beats per minute.\nA high coronary calcium score reduces the accuracy of the test.\n112 However, \nper-segment calcification (circumferential extent of calcium - arc calcium) has \na stronger influence on diagnostic accuracy than the total calcium score.121 \nCoronary CTA interpretation is less reliable in the presence of coronary stents of <3mm.\n122 In situations where the clinical presentation suggests \nlow-to-intermediate probability for restenosis and in the presence of larger stents, coronary CTA may be a reasonable alternative to invasive                      \nangiography to rule out significant in-stent restenosis.\n123\nIt is highly accurate in the assessment of coronary artery bypass grafts.124 \nThe interpretation of native coronary vessels in post bypass patients is \nhowever, more difficult.124\nCTA may be considered in:\n  individuals with low to intermediate PTP of CAD and who have mild or  \n  equivocal changes of ischemia in the exercise stress test or stress  \n  imaging tests and who are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic with  \n  good exercise capacity.112–115\n7.2 Risk Stratification of Stable CAD by Resting ECG\nResting ECG abnormalities can predict patients at greater risk of future CV \nevents than those with a normal ECG. These abnormalities \ninclude:63,127,133,135,143-145\n evidence of prior MI\n LBBB\n left anterior hemiblock, \n Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH)\n second or third-degree AV block atrial fibrillation (AF)\n7.3 Risk Stratification of Stable CAD by Left Ventricular Function\nLV function is the strongest predictor of survival. Patients with an LVEF of \n<50 % are already at high risk of CV death (annual mortality rate of >3%) \nwithout incorporating other risk factors.\n45,46,133,134,146,147\nIn the presence of a depressed LV function, it is important to determine if this is due to infarcted (scar) tissue or viable but stunned ischemic myocardium. \nThis can be done by stress imaging techniques. In the presence of ischemic \nbut viable myocardium, coronary revascularisation can result in an                    \nimprovement in LV function and survival.\n148\n7.4 Risk Stratification of Stable CAD by Non-invasive Testing \nNon-invasive tests provide useful information for prognostication. (Table 2, \npg 24) A negative test carries a good prognosis but the clinical evaluation \n(e.g. age, ability to exercise, exercise duration, co-morbidity such as \ndiabetes, CKD etc) and LV function should also be considered when              \nassessing CV risk. \nSmall imaging sub studies have shown mixed results when looking at CV \noutcomes in individuals with moderate to severe ischemia treated with \nrevascularization as compared to OMT.149–152 Two large clinical trials have not \nshown any advantage of revascularization as compared to OMT in these patients.\n76,153 In individuals with depressed LV function (LVEF ≤35%) CABG \ndid not reduce all-cause mortality but resulted in a reduction in CV mortality and hospitalizations.\n154 The ISCHEMIA trial is a large randomized clinical trial \nthat is currently underway specifically addressing the role of revascularisation \nversus OMT in patients with moderate to severe myocardial ischemia.155 \nIn patients with unprotected Left Main stem stenosis of > 50%, revascularisation \nby CABG has been shown to improve survival in the pivotal Coronary Artery \nSurgery Study (CASS) Registry.156  In view of this “the benefit of surgery over \nmedical treatment in patients with significant LMS stenosis (greater than 50%) is little argued.” \n157\n7.5.

The diagnostic \nperformance of these modalities is almost similar and the preference to use one \nimaging modality or the other depends on local expertise and availability.3,81\nThe choice of stress imaging technique will depend on:\n  the patient - ability to exercise, obesity, lung problems which may affect image  \n  quality. \n  local resources and expertise.\nPrior to performing the test, the following should be considered:\n  the modality is performed and interpreted by adequately trained personnel.\n  each modality of testing has its own inherent risk e.g. radiation, contrast  \n  sensitivity, bodily injury and interpretation error which should be explained to  \n  the patient.   \nCTA should not be used as a screening test for CAD in the asymptomatic \nindividual. \nDue to the low prevalence of disease in most individuals undergoing health \nscreening, there tends to be too many false-positive lesions. Also, many minor lesions not causing ischemia may be found, potentially resulting in \nunnecessary downstream invasive procedures and intervention.\n6.3.3  Diagnostic Accuracy of Invasive Coronary Angiography (ICA)\nInvasive Coronary angiography has been the “gold standard” for the                 \ndiagnosis of CAD. It can detect obstructive lesions with negative remodelling \naccurately but unlike CTA, it may not be able to detect non-obstructive \nlesions with positive remodelling where the lumen diameter may be \nmaintained.\nICA is rarely necessary in stable patients with suspected CAD for the sole \npurpose of establishing the diagnosis of CAD. It is indicated, following       \nnon-invasive risk stratification, to determine the most appropriate mode of \nrevascularization. \n7.  RISK STRATIFICATION IN STABLE CAD\nThe objectives of risk stratification in stable CAD are for: \n prognosis choosing the appropriate management strategy (e.g. revascularisation in high risk  \n groups)\nAbsolute levels of what constitutes high risk and low risk are not clearly defined for \nthose with stable CAD. There are several risk assessment scores for individuals with stable CAD using different CV end points.\n1,2,64,125-128\nThe ESC guidelines define risk as:44\n high risk - annual mortality of >3%\n intermediate risk - annual mortality of 1-3%\n low risk - annual mortality of <1%Patients with stable CAD should be risk stratified using the following parameters:\n clinical evaluation \n resting ECG \n assessment of left ventricular function\n non-invasive assessment of myocardial ischemia\n where indicated, evaluation of coronary anatomy and physiological  \n assessment of the significance of the coronary lesion\n7.1 Risk Stratification of Stable CAD by Clinical Evaluation\nImportant predictors of adverse outcomes in patients with stable CAD \nare:28,63,129–142\n  increasing age  prior MI  symptoms and signs of CHF\n  pattern of occurrence of angina (recent onset or progressive)\n  severity of angina, particularly if unresponsive to therapy\n  presence of atherosclerotic disease in other vascular beds - peripheral  \n  vessels, cerebral and/or aorta  presence of CV risk factors:\n    Diabetes\n    Hypertension\n    Metabolic syndrome\n    Current smoking\n    Dyslipidaemia\n    Family history of premature CAD\n  co-existing medical conditions:\n    Diabetes \n   Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)\n  psychosocial factors \n    Depression\n    Poor social support\nThe above adverse clinical predictors especially the severity of angina help \nmodulate decisions made based on non-invasive tests of ischemia and \nwhere indicated, physiological testing by Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR).In the diagnosis of CAD, these modalities are used in individuals who have \nintermediate PTP of CAD and who:\n  are unable to exercise adequately or\n  have exercise stress ECG with equivocal results or abnormal at moderate  \n  to high workloads, or \n  have un-interpretable ECG that makes interpretation of exercise stress  \n  ECG test difficult. \nIn the presence of LBBB and ventricular paced rhythms, stress imaging \ntechniques are the non-invasive tests of choice although the diagnostic \naccuracy in these situations, is reduced.\n82 \nIn patients with multivessel disease, imaging tests especially Stress MPI can sometimes underestimate the amount of myocardial ischemia. This is because these tests are based on the principle of perfusion differences \nbetween different myocardial territories and therefore require at least one \nnon-ischemic myocardial territory as a “normal” reference to be able to detect \ninducible myocardial ischemia in another territory. If all 3 vessels are                 \nsignificantly narrowed or there is a combination of left main and multivessel CAD, uniform tracer uptake due to “balanced” ischemia may lead to a rather \nhomogeneous tracer uptake and result in a false negative result.\n83-85\n6.2.2.1  Diagnostic Accuracy of Stress echocardiogram - exercise or  \n    pharmacological stress (dobutamine)\nThis is one of the least expensive and most widely available stress imaging \ntechniques.\nAn exercise stress echocardiogram is more physiological than pharmacological \nstress and is the stress of choice wherever possible.86,87\nPharmacological stress is preferred if the patient is unable to exercise or if \nthere are wall motion abnormalities seen at rest. The pharmacological stressor \nmost often used is dobutamine. The increase in cardiac workload seen with \ndobutamine is less than that with exercise. The addition of atropine augments \nthe sensitivity of the dobutamine stress echocardiogram (DSE).86,88 With the \nuse of dobutamine, viability can also be assessed.89\nThe marker for ischemia in stress echocardiogram is absence of wall thickening and inducible new or worsening wall motion abnormalities before, during and after the stress.\n86,87 If severe, there is also a decrease in LV ejection fraction and LV \nenlargement on stress.86,87 The presence of inducible wall motion abnormalities \nimplies significant limitation of blood flow at peak stress, and usually corresponds to a functionally significant stenosis, although the anatomic severity and physiologic \nconsequences are poorly related.\n86\nDSE has good sensitivity and specificity especially in the setting of multivessel \ndisease and previous MI.81,87,90-92 The interpretation is dependent on the adequacy of \nstress. In the diagnosis of CAD, the sensitivity of DSE is reduced in the presence of \nsingle vessel disease, small vessels and distal disease.86 It has greater use in \nprognostication of CAD and for the prediction of myocardial viability.86,87,91,93\nDSE has also a long learning curve and is relatively subjective relying on the human eye for the accurate assessment of myocardial motion. With the usage of myocardial contrast agents or microbubbles, endocardial border delineation is enhanced, and \nimage quality and diagnostic accuracy improved.\n94-96\n6.2.2.2.   Diagnostic Accuracy of Myocardial Perfusion Imaging (MPI) via  \n     SPECT \nMPI most commonly uses technetium-99m sestamibi as the radiotracer and SPECT \nfor imaging. Stress can be either by exercise or pharmacological agents -                    \nadenosine, dipyridamole or dobutamine.\nIschemia is indicated by reduced radiotracer uptake during stress when compared \nwith the uptake at rest. Transient ischaemic dilatation and reduced post-stress LV \nejection fraction are important predictors of severe CAD.\nSPECT detects a relative reduction in myocardial blood volume that occurs earlier \nthan wall thickening abnormality in the ischaemic cascade. Despite this, SPECT has \nnot been shown to be significantly superior to stress echocardiography in terms of \nsensitivity and detecting the extent of CAD.97 This is due to the poorer spatial         \nresolution of SPECT (12mm) as compared to stress echocardiography (2mm).91\nIn the diagnosis of CAD, MPI with SPECT has good sensitivity and specificity.98 The \ndiagnostic image quality is affected in obese patients, as well as in women with large \nbreasts. The diagnostic accuracy is also reduced in the presence of LBBB and \nventricular pacing.82,99 Other disadvantages are the use of ionizing radiation and its \ncost.6.2.2.3  Diagnostic Accuracy of Stress Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR)\nStress CMR with the use of dobutamine can be used to look at regional wall motion \nabnormalities similar to DSE and with a similar safety profile.100-102 In studies on \npatients with high disease prevalence, stress CMR demonstrated overall good sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of CAD.\n103-105 It is particularly useful in \npatients where it is difficult to acquire good echocardiographic images due to poor \nacoustic windows. \nPerfusion CMR (with adenosine) also has good diagnostic accuracy as compared to \nMPI (nuclear studies).101,105-107 It has also demonstrated good correlation with \nPressure wire (Fractional Flow Reserve) measurements.108\n6.3.  Anatomical testing in the Diagnosis of CAD\n6.3.1  Coronary Calcium Score (CAC)\nCalcium accumulates in coronary arteries in an age-related manner. Thus, all scores \nmust be adjusted for age, as well as for sex.109 The relationship of arterial calcification, \nlike that of angiographic coronary artery stenosis, to the probability of plaque rupture is unknown. Vulnerable plaques are frequently present in the absence of calcification.\n109\nCoronary calcium score has been used to detect CAD. Most studies demonstrated a high sensitivity but a much lower specificity, and an overall predictive accuracy of ≈70% in typical CAD patient populations.\n109 CAC was found not to be superior to other \nnon-invasive diagnostic modalities for the detection of CAD.109 In general, a negative \ntest (CAC =0):109\n  makes the presence of atherosclerotic plaques, including unstable plaques,  \n  very unlikely.  is highly unlikely in the presence of significant luminal obstructive disease.\n  occurs in most patients who have angiographically normal coronary arteries.\nCAC score is more useful in CV risk assessment. (Section 7.5.1, pg 56) \nIn the emergency room, CAC may be used in the triage of patients with a negative \nresting ECG and normal cardiac biomarkers. A CAC=0 has a high sensitivity and a \nvery high negative predictive value for CAD.\n110,1116.3.2  Diagnostic Accuracy of Computed Tomography Angiography  \n   (CTA)\nCTA allows visualization of the coronary arteries non-invasively. It can also \ndetermine the extent of coronary calcification, degree of luminal stenosis, degree of luminal remodelling and plaque characteristics. \nIt is usually done as a 2-stage procedure. The first being the quantification of \ncoronary calcium (CAC) and the second is the CTA. The 64-slice detector is \nthe minimum machine requirement. It has a negative predictive value of 93-99% and sensitivity and specificity of 90-94% and 95-97%                                respectively.\n112-120 It is most useful in the diagnostic assessment of individuals \nwith low or intermediate PTP of CAD.112–115\nCareful patient selection and preparation is integral to obtaining good images. These include:  patients with adequate breath holding capabilities.\n  absence of severe obesity.\n • a favourable calcium score (<400 Agatston score) and distribution.   presence of sinus rhythm (absence of ectopics).  heart rate of less than 65 beats per minute.\nA high coronary calcium score reduces the accuracy of the test.\n112 However, \nper-segment calcification (circumferential extent of calcium - arc calcium) has \na stronger influence on diagnostic accuracy than the total calcium score.121 \nCoronary CTA interpretation is less reliable in the presence of coronary stents of <3mm.\n122 In situations where the clinical presentation suggests \nlow-to-intermediate probability for restenosis and in the presence of larger stents, coronary CTA may be a reasonable alternative to invasive                      \nangiography to rule out significant in-stent restenosis.\n123\nIt is highly accurate in the assessment of coronary artery bypass grafts.124 \nThe interpretation of native coronary vessels in post bypass patients is \nhowever, more difficult.124\nCTA may be considered in:\n  individuals with low to intermediate PTP of CAD and who have mild or  \n  equivocal changes of ischemia in the exercise stress test or stress  \n  imaging tests and who are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic with  \n  good exercise capacity.112–115\n7.2 Risk Stratification of Stable CAD by Resting ECG\nResting ECG abnormalities can predict patients at greater risk of future CV \nevents than those with a normal ECG. These abnormalities \ninclude:63,127,133,135,143-145\n evidence of prior MI\n LBBB\n left anterior hemiblock, \n Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH)\n second or third-degree AV block atrial fibrillation (AF)\n7.3 Risk Stratification of Stable CAD by Left Ventricular Function\nLV function is the strongest predictor of survival. Patients with an LVEF of \n<50 % are already at high risk of CV death (annual mortality rate of >3%) \nwithout incorporating other risk factors.\n45,46,133,134,146,147\nIn the presence of a depressed LV function, it is important to determine if this is due to infarcted (scar) tissue or viable but stunned ischemic myocardium. \nThis can be done by stress imaging techniques. In the presence of ischemic \nbut viable myocardium, coronary revascularisation can result in an                    \nimprovement in LV function and survival.\n148\n7.4 Risk Stratification of Stable CAD by Non-invasive Testing \nNon-invasive tests provide useful information for prognostication. (Table 2, \npg 24) A negative test carries a good prognosis but the clinical evaluation \n(e.g. age, ability to exercise, exercise duration, co-morbidity such as \ndiabetes, CKD etc) and LV function should also be considered when              \nassessing CV risk. \nSmall imaging sub studies have shown mixed results when looking at CV \noutcomes in individuals with moderate to severe ischemia treated with \nrevascularization as compared to OMT.149–152 Two large clinical trials have not \nshown any advantage of revascularization as compared to OMT in these patients.\n76,153 In individuals with depressed LV function (LVEF ≤35%) CABG \ndid not reduce all-cause mortality but resulted in a reduction in CV mortality and hospitalizations.\n154 The ISCHEMIA trial is a large randomized clinical trial \nthat is currently underway specifically addressing the role of revascularisation \nversus OMT in patients with moderate to severe myocardial ischemia.155 \nIn patients with unprotected Left Main stem stenosis of > 50%, revascularisation \nby CABG has been shown to improve survival in the pivotal Coronary Artery \nSurgery Study (CASS) Registry.156  In view of this “the benefit of surgery over \nmedical treatment in patients with significant LMS stenosis (greater than 50%) is little argued.” \n157\n7.5.  Risk Stratification of Stable CAD by Anatomic testing\n \n7.5.1  Coronary Calcium (CAC) Score \nCAC scores help with CV risk stratification.158-163 (Table 8, pg 57) It guides risk \nreduction strategy, OMT and the need for further evaluation. CAC score alone was able to predict CHD risk independently of the           \nFramingham Risk Score.\n156,157 When used together with the traditional CV risk \nfactors, it had incremental value in CV risk prediction.164,165 There is a                \nsignificant correlation between CAC score and overall coronary artery         atherosclerotic plaque, with a high sensitivity >95% and a high negative \npredictive value of >95%.\n109,166,167 The CAC score was found to be highly \npredictive of CV risk in 4 ethnic groups - white, black, Hispanic, and \nChinese.168 \nPersons both asymptomatic and symptomatic, with a calcium score =0 have \na low CV event rate and an excellent long-term survival.167,169 However the \nPTP of disease and the clinical setting should be considered when                     \ninterpreting the test result. In interpreting a CAC =0:170\n if the PTP of CAD is low (e.g. asymptomatic individuals), there is low risk  \n of CAD and a low risk of near-term coronary events. \n in older asymptomatic patients with risk factors, there is a moderate   \n increased risk of CV events.\n in persons with clinical signs and symptoms associated with an intermediate  \n to high risk of CAD, there is often associated myocardial ischemia on  \n provocative testing and a high risk of near-term coronary events.1717.5.3  Risk Stratification by Invasive Coronary Angiography (ICA)  \nICA continues to be the “gold standard” in assessing coronary anatomy \nalthough it has its limitations. It cannot detect vulnerable plaques which are in \nmost cases not severe (<50% stenosis) but have a rich lipid core. \nDespite these limitations, the extent and site of coronary lesions provide good \nprognostic indicators. The prognosis is worse if: \n46,146,147\n  the greater the number of vessels involved. • there is left main stem stenosis of >50%.  the proximal LAD is involved.\nRecent large clinical trials did not however, show any improvement in clinical \noutcomes in patients with significant stable CAD when an initial strategy of \ncoronary revascularization was compared to intensive OMT.\n76,153,154\nIn patients who have unprotected left main stem stenosis, CABG has been shown to improve survival when compared to medical therapy in the large \nCASS registry.\n156 Although this trial was performed before the era of current \nintensive OMT, it is considered unethical to repeat it. \nCoronary arteriography should NOT be performed in patients: \n with angina who refuse invasive diagnostic procedures.\n• who prefer to avoid coronary revascularization either by PCI or CABG.\n who are not candidates for PCI or CABG. in whom PCI/CABG will not improve quality-of-life.\n7.5.4  Risk assessment by Physiological Assessment of the functional  \n   severity of coronary lesions \nCoronary angiography is of limited value in defining the functional                   \nsignificance of coronary stenosis. Yet the most important factor related to \noutcome is the presence and extent of inducible ischemia.\n177 If a stenosis is \nnot flow-limiting, it will not cause angina and the prognosis without coronary \nintervention is excellent, with a ‘hard’ event rate (cardiac death or non-fatal \nMI) of <1% per year.175 This event rate was not reduced with PCI and \nstenting.1757.5.4.1 Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR) \nThe functional severity of coronary lesions visualized angiographically may \nbe assessed invasively, by measuring the intracoronary artery pressure or \nFractional Flow Reserve (FFR). FFR is more accurate than visual                       assessment of the significance and severity of coronary lesions.\n176 Even in \nthe presence of angiographically insignificant stenosis, lesions with low FFR showed significantly higher event rates than those with high FFR.\n178\nFFR is presently considered as the ‘gold standard’ for invasive assessment of the significance of coronary stenosis and is useful in decision making in the \nneed for coronary revascularization.

In individuals on OMT with:\n84,179-184\n • FFR >0.80 - have no improved outcomes with revascularisation.\n  FFR between >0.75 but <0.8 - have intermediate benefit with                        \n  revascularisation and management should be based on clinical  \n  judgement.  • FFR <0.75 - benefit from revascularisation. \nUse of FFR accurately identifies which coronary lesions should be                       \nrevascularized and improves outcome. \nIt is recommended that in individuals with stable CAD, FFR be used to guide \nrevascularization of lesions of intermediate severity.\n182-185\nAt present, there are ongoing studies on the use of instantaneous wave-free \nratio (iFR), a pressure-derived index of stenosis severity that is not obtained I, A\nTable 8: Coronary Calcium score and CV risk*#\n \n7.5.2  Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA)\nCTA may also be used for prognostication.

The diagnostic \nperformance of these modalities is almost similar and the preference to use one \nimaging modality or the other depends on local expertise and availability.3,81\nThe choice of stress imaging technique will depend on:\n  the patient - ability to exercise, obesity, lung problems which may affect image  \n  quality. \n  local resources and expertise.\nPrior to performing the test, the following should be considered:\n  the modality is performed and interpreted by adequately trained personnel.\n  each modality of testing has its own inherent risk e.g. radiation, contrast  \n  sensitivity, bodily injury and interpretation error which should be explained to  \n  the patient.   \nCTA should not be used as a screening test for CAD in the asymptomatic \nindividual. \nDue to the low prevalence of disease in most individuals undergoing health \nscreening, there tends to be too many false-positive lesions. Also, many minor lesions not causing ischemia may be found, potentially resulting in \nunnecessary downstream invasive procedures and intervention.\n6.3.3  Diagnostic Accuracy of Invasive Coronary Angiography (ICA)\nInvasive Coronary angiography has been the “gold standard” for the                 \ndiagnosis of CAD. It can detect obstructive lesions with negative remodelling \naccurately but unlike CTA, it may not be able to detect non-obstructive \nlesions with positive remodelling where the lumen diameter may be \nmaintained.\nICA is rarely necessary in stable patients with suspected CAD for the sole \npurpose of establishing the diagnosis of CAD. It is indicated, following       \nnon-invasive risk stratification, to determine the most appropriate mode of \nrevascularization. \n7.  RISK STRATIFICATION IN STABLE CAD\nThe objectives of risk stratification in stable CAD are for: \n prognosis\n choosing the appropriate management strategy (e.g. revascularisation in high risk  \n groups)\nAbsolute levels of what constitutes high risk and low risk are not clearly defined for \nthose with stable CAD. There are several risk assessment scores for individuals with \nstable CAD using different CV end points.1,2,64,125-128\nThe ESC guidelines define risk as:44\n high risk - annual mortality of >3%\n intermediate risk - annual mortality of 1-3%\n low risk - annual mortality of <1%Patients with stable CAD should be risk stratified using the following parameters:\n clinical evaluation \n resting ECG \n assessment of left ventricular function\n non-invasive assessment of myocardial ischemia\n where indicated, evaluation of coronary anatomy and physiological  \n assessment of the significance of the coronary lesion\n7.1 Risk Stratification of Stable CAD by Clinical Evaluation\nImportant predictors of adverse outcomes in patients with stable CAD \nare:28,63,129–142\n  increasing age  prior MI  symptoms and signs of CHF\n  pattern of occurrence of angina (recent onset or progressive)\n  severity of angina, particularly if unresponsive to therapy\n  presence of atherosclerotic disease in other vascular beds - peripheral  \n  vessels, cerebral and/or aorta  presence of CV risk factors:\n    Diabetes\n    Hypertension\n    Metabolic syndrome\n    Current smoking\n    Dyslipidaemia\n    Family history of premature CAD\n  co-existing medical conditions:\n    Diabetes \n   Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)\n  psychosocial factors \n    Depression\n    Poor social support\nThe above adverse clinical predictors especially the severity of angina help \nmodulate decisions made based on non-invasive tests of ischemia and \nwhere indicated, physiological testing by Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR).In the diagnosis of CAD, these modalities are used in individuals who have \nintermediate PTP of CAD and who:\n  are unable to exercise adequately or\n  have exercise stress ECG with equivocal results or abnormal at moderate  \n  to high workloads, or \n  have un-interpretable ECG that makes interpretation of exercise stress  \n  ECG test difficult. \nIn the presence of LBBB and ventricular paced rhythms, stress imaging \ntechniques are the non-invasive tests of choice although the diagnostic \naccuracy in these situations, is reduced.\n82 \nIn patients with multivessel disease, imaging tests especially Stress MPI can sometimes underestimate the amount of myocardial ischemia. This is because these tests are based on the principle of perfusion differences \nbetween different myocardial territories and therefore require at least one \nnon-ischemic myocardial territory as a “normal” reference to be able to detect \ninducible myocardial ischemia in another territory. If all 3 vessels are                 \nsignificantly narrowed or there is a combination of left main and multivessel CAD, uniform tracer uptake due to “balanced” ischemia may lead to a rather \nhomogeneous tracer uptake and result in a false negative result.\n83-85\n6.2.2.1  Diagnostic Accuracy of Stress echocardiogram - exercise or  \n    pharmacological stress (dobutamine)\nThis is one of the least expensive and most widely available stress imaging \ntechniques.\nAn exercise stress echocardiogram is more physiological than pharmacological \nstress and is the stress of choice wherever possible.86,87\nPharmacological stress is preferred if the patient is unable to exercise or if \nthere are wall motion abnormalities seen at rest. The pharmacological stressor \nmost often used is dobutamine. The increase in cardiac workload seen with \ndobutamine is less than that with exercise. The addition of atropine augments \nthe sensitivity of the dobutamine stress echocardiogram (DSE).86,88 With the \nuse of dobutamine, viability can also be assessed.89\nThe marker for ischemia in stress echocardiogram is absence of wall thickening and inducible new or worsening wall motion abnormalities before, during and after the stress.\n86,87 If severe, there is also a decrease in LV ejection fraction and LV \nenlargement on stress.86,87 The presence of inducible wall motion abnormalities \nimplies significant limitation of blood flow at peak stress, and usually corresponds to a functionally significant stenosis, although the anatomic severity and physiologic \nconsequences are poorly related.\n86\nDSE has good sensitivity and specificity especially in the setting of multivessel \ndisease and previous MI.81,87,90-92 The interpretation is dependent on the adequacy of \nstress. In the diagnosis of CAD, the sensitivity of DSE is reduced in the presence of \nsingle vessel disease, small vessels and distal disease.86 It has greater use in \nprognostication of CAD and for the prediction of myocardial viability.86,87,91,93\nDSE has also a long learning curve and is relatively subjective relying on the human eye for the accurate assessment of myocardial motion. With the usage of myocardial contrast agents or microbubbles, endocardial border delineation is enhanced, and \nimage quality and diagnostic accuracy improved.\n94-96\n6.2.2.2.   Diagnostic Accuracy of Myocardial Perfusion Imaging (MPI) via  \n     SPECT \nMPI most commonly uses technetium-99m sestamibi as the radiotracer and SPECT \nfor imaging. Stress can be either by exercise or pharmacological agents -                    \nadenosine, dipyridamole or dobutamine.\nIschemia is indicated by reduced radiotracer uptake during stress when compared \nwith the uptake at rest. Transient ischaemic dilatation and reduced post-stress LV \nejection fraction are important predictors of severe CAD.\nSPECT detects a relative reduction in myocardial blood volume that occurs earlier \nthan wall thickening abnormality in the ischaemic cascade. Despite this, SPECT has \nnot been shown to be significantly superior to stress echocardiography in terms of \nsensitivity and detecting the extent of CAD.97 This is due to the poorer spatial         \nresolution of SPECT (12mm) as compared to stress echocardiography (2mm).91\nIn the diagnosis of CAD, MPI with SPECT has good sensitivity and specificity.98 The \ndiagnostic image quality is affected in obese patients, as well as in women with large \nbreasts. The diagnostic accuracy is also reduced in the presence of LBBB and \nventricular pacing.82,99 Other disadvantages are the use of ionizing radiation and its \ncost.6.2.2.3  Diagnostic Accuracy of Stress Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR)\nStress CMR with the use of dobutamine can be used to look at regional wall motion \nabnormalities similar to DSE and with a similar safety profile.100-102 In studies on \npatients with high disease prevalence, stress CMR demonstrated overall good sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of CAD.\n103-105 It is particularly useful in \npatients where it is difficult to acquire good echocardiographic images due to poor \nacoustic windows. \nPerfusion CMR (with adenosine) also has good diagnostic accuracy as compared to \nMPI (nuclear studies).101,105-107 It has also demonstrated good correlation with \nPressure wire (Fractional Flow Reserve) measurements.108\n6.3.  Anatomical testing in the Diagnosis of CAD\n6.3.1  Coronary Calcium Score (CAC)\nCalcium accumulates in coronary arteries in an age-related manner. Thus, all scores \nmust be adjusted for age, as well as for sex.109 The relationship of arterial calcification, \nlike that of angiographic coronary artery stenosis, to the probability of plaque rupture is unknown. Vulnerable plaques are frequently present in the absence of calcification.\n109\nCoronary calcium score has been used to detect CAD. Most studies demonstrated a high sensitivity but a much lower specificity, and an overall predictive accuracy of ≈70% in typical CAD patient populations.\n109 CAC was found not to be superior to other \nnon-invasive diagnostic modalities for the detection of CAD.109 In general, a negative \ntest (CAC =0):109\n  makes the presence of atherosclerotic plaques, including unstable plaques,  \n  very unlikely.  is highly unlikely in the presence of significant luminal obstructive disease.\n  occurs in most patients who have angiographically normal coronary arteries.\nCAC score is more useful in CV risk assessment. (Section 7.5.1, pg 56) \nIn the emergency room, CAC may be used in the triage of patients with a negative \nresting ECG and normal cardiac biomarkers. A CAC=0 has a high sensitivity and a \nvery high negative predictive value for CAD.\n110,1116.3.2  Diagnostic Accuracy of Computed Tomography Angiography  \n   (CTA)\nCTA allows visualization of the coronary arteries non-invasively. It can also \ndetermine the extent of coronary calcification, degree of luminal stenosis, degree of luminal remodelling and plaque characteristics. \nIt is usually done as a 2-stage procedure. The first being the quantification of \ncoronary calcium (CAC) and the second is the CTA. The 64-slice detector is \nthe minimum machine requirement. It has a negative predictive value of 93-99% and sensitivity and specificity of 90-94% and 95-97%                                respectively.\n112-120 It is most useful in the diagnostic assessment of individuals \nwith low or intermediate PTP of CAD.112–115\nCareful patient selection and preparation is integral to obtaining good images. These include:  patients with adequate breath holding capabilities.\n  absence of severe obesity.\n • a favourable calcium score (<400 Agatston score) and distribution.   presence of sinus rhythm (absence of ectopics).  heart rate of less than 65 beats per minute.\nA high coronary calcium score reduces the accuracy of the test.\n112 However, \nper-segment calcification (circumferential extent of calcium - arc calcium) has \na stronger influence on diagnostic accuracy than the total calcium score.121 \nCoronary CTA interpretation is less reliable in the presence of coronary stents of <3mm.\n122 In situations where the clinical presentation suggests \nlow-to-intermediate probability for restenosis and in the presence of larger stents, coronary CTA may be a reasonable alternative to invasive                      \nangiography to rule out significant in-stent restenosis.\n123\nIt is highly accurate in the assessment of coronary artery bypass grafts.124 \nThe interpretation of native coronary vessels in post bypass patients is \nhowever, more difficult.124\nCTA may be considered in:\n  individuals with low to intermediate PTP of CAD and who have mild or  \n  equivocal changes of ischemia in the exercise stress test or stress  \n  imaging tests and who are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic with  \n  good exercise capacity.112–115\n7.2 Risk Stratification of Stable CAD by Resting ECG\nResting ECG abnormalities can predict patients at greater risk of future CV \nevents than those with a normal ECG. These abnormalities \ninclude:63,127,133,135,143-145\n evidence of prior MI\n LBBB\n left anterior hemiblock, \n Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH)\n second or third-degree AV block atrial fibrillation (AF)\n7.3 Risk Stratification of Stable CAD by Left Ventricular Function\nLV function is the strongest predictor of survival. Patients with an LVEF of \n<50 % are already at high risk of CV death (annual mortality rate of >3%) \nwithout incorporating other risk factors.\n45,46,133,134,146,147\nIn the presence of a depressed LV function, it is important to determine if this is due to infarcted (scar) tissue or viable but stunned ischemic myocardium. \nThis can be done by stress imaging techniques. In the presence of ischemic \nbut viable myocardium, coronary revascularisation can result in an                    \nimprovement in LV function and survival.\n148\n7.4 Risk Stratification of Stable CAD by Non-invasive Testing \nNon-invasive tests provide useful information for prognostication. (Table 2, \npg 24) A negative test carries a good prognosis but the clinical evaluation \n(e.g. age, ability to exercise, exercise duration, co-morbidity such as \ndiabetes, CKD etc) and LV function should also be considered when              \nassessing CV risk. \nSmall imaging sub studies have shown mixed results when looking at CV \noutcomes in individuals with moderate to severe ischemia treated with \nrevascularization as compared to OMT.149–152 Two large clinical trials have not \nshown any advantage of revascularization as compared to OMT in these patients.\n76,153 In individuals with depressed LV function (LVEF ≤35%) CABG \ndid not reduce all-cause mortality but resulted in a reduction in CV mortality and hospitalizations.\n154 The ISCHEMIA trial is a large randomized clinical trial \nthat is currently underway specifically addressing the role of revascularisation \nversus OMT in patients with moderate to severe myocardial ischemia.155 \nIn patients with unprotected Left Main stem stenosis of > 50%, revascularisation \nby CABG has been shown to improve survival in the pivotal Coronary Artery \nSurgery Study (CASS) Registry.156  In view of this “the benefit of surgery over \nmedical treatment in patients with significant LMS stenosis (greater than 50%) is little argued.” \n157\n7.5.  Risk Stratification of Stable CAD by Anatomic testing\n \n7.5.1  Coronary Calcium (CAC) Score \nCAC scores help with CV risk stratification.158-163 (Table 8, pg 57) It guides risk \nreduction strategy, OMT and the need for further evaluation. CAC score alone was able to predict CHD risk independently of the           \nFramingham Risk Score.\n156,157 When used together with the traditional CV risk \nfactors, it had incremental value in CV risk prediction.164,165 There is a                \nsignificant correlation between CAC score and overall coronary artery         atherosclerotic plaque, with a high sensitivity >95% and a high negative \npredictive value of >95%.\n109,166,167 The CAC score was found to be highly \npredictive of CV risk in 4 ethnic groups - white, black, Hispanic, and \nChinese.168 \nPersons both asymptomatic and symptomatic, with a calcium score =0 have \na low CV event rate and an excellent long-term survival.167,169 However the \nPTP of disease and the clinical setting should be considered when                     \ninterpreting the test result. In interpreting a CAC =0:170\n if the PTP of CAD is low (e.g. asymptomatic individuals), there is low risk  \n of CAD and a low risk of near-term coronary events. \n in older asymptomatic patients with risk factors, there is a moderate   \n increased risk of CV events.\n in persons with clinical signs and symptoms associated with an intermediate  \n to high risk of CAD, there is often associated myocardial ischemia on  \n provocative testing and a high risk of near-term coronary events.1717.5.3  Risk Stratification by Invasive Coronary Angiography (ICA)  \nICA continues to be the “gold standard” in assessing coronary anatomy \nalthough it has its limitations. It cannot detect vulnerable plaques which are in \nmost cases not severe (<50% stenosis) but have a rich lipid core. \nDespite these limitations, the extent and site of coronary lesions provide good \nprognostic indicators. The prognosis is worse if: \n46,146,147\n  the greater the number of vessels involved. • there is left main stem stenosis of >50%.  the proximal LAD is involved.\nRecent large clinical trials did not however, show any improvement in clinical \noutcomes in patients with significant stable CAD when an initial strategy of \ncoronary revascularization was compared to intensive OMT.\n76,153,154\nIn patients who have unprotected left main stem stenosis, CABG has been shown to improve survival when compared to medical therapy in the large \nCASS registry.\n156 Although this trial was performed before the era of current \nintensive OMT, it is considered unethical to repeat it. \nCoronary arteriography should NOT be performed in patients: \n with angina who refuse invasive diagnostic procedures.\n• who prefer to avoid coronary revascularization either by PCI or CABG.\n who are not candidates for PCI or CABG. in whom PCI/CABG will not improve quality-of-life.\n7.5.4  Risk assessment by Physiological Assessment of the functional  \n   severity of coronary lesions \nCoronary angiography is of limited value in defining the functional                   \nsignificance of coronary stenosis. Yet the most important factor related to \noutcome is the presence and extent of inducible ischemia.177 If a stenosis is \nnot flow-limiting, it will not cause angina and the prognosis without coronary \nintervention is excellent, with a ‘hard’ event rate (cardiac death or non-fatal \nMI) of <1% per year.175 This event rate was not reduced with PCI and \nstenting.1757.5.4.1 Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR) \nThe functional severity of coronary lesions visualized angiographically may \nbe assessed invasively, by measuring the intracoronary artery pressure or \nFractional Flow Reserve (FFR). FFR is more accurate than visual                       assessment of the significance and severity of coronary lesions.\n176 Even in \nthe presence of angiographically insignificant stenosis, lesions with low FFR showed significantly higher event rates than those with high FFR.\n178\nFFR is presently considered as the ‘gold standard’ for invasive assessment of the significance of coronary stenosis and is useful in decision making in the \nneed for coronary revascularization. This: \n84\n  takes into consideration collateral blood flow.  takes into consideration the amount of viable myocardial mass.\n  is independent of haemodynamic variations.\n  has a high reproducibility. \nFFR is indicated for all coronary artery stenosis of 50-90%, including left main \nstenosis, side branch stenosis, tandem lesions and even in the setting of      \nnon-culprit lesions in ACS.\n84,179-181 In patients with multivessel CAD, PCI \nguided by FFR results in an improved outcome irrespective of available \nnon-invasive functional test results.182-184\nFFR is calculated as the ratio of distal coronary pressure to aortic pressure \nmeasured during maximal hyperaemia with either intracoronary or                        intravenous infusion of adenosine. A normal value for FFR is 1.0 regardless \nof the status of the microcirculation. In individuals on OMT with:\n84,179-184\n • FFR >0.80 - have no improved outcomes with revascularisation.\n  FFR between >0.75 but <0.8 - have intermediate benefit with                        \n  revascularisation and management should be based on clinical  \n  judgement.  • FFR <0.75 - benefit from revascularisation. \nUse of FFR accurately identifies which coronary lesions should be                       \nrevascularized and improves outcome. \nIt is recommended that in individuals with stable CAD, FFR be used to guide \nrevascularization of lesions of intermediate severity.\n182-185\nAt present, there are ongoing studies on the use of instantaneous wave-free \nratio (iFR), a pressure-derived index of stenosis severity that is not obtained III, C\nI, C\n51\nTable 8: Coronary Calcium score and CV risk*#\n \n7.5.2  Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA)\nCTA may also be used for prognostication. There is a strong predictive value \nfor mortality and major CV events independent of traditional risk \nfactors.7-9,172-174\nIn assessing prognosis, in patients with: \n • absence of any plaque the CV event rate is low - 0.24% for CV   \n  death/non-fatal MI and an annual mortality of 0.28%.7,8\n  coronary plaque but without stenosis, the mortality rate is higher but  \n  remains below 0.5%.9\n • left main stenosis or proximal triple vessel disease - the hazard ratio for    all-cause mortality is 3.70.\n7\nDespite its’ excellent predictive value, in a randomized controlled trial comparing functional testing with MPI using SPECT and CTA as initial \ndiagnostic strategies in patients with suspected CAD, there were no \ndifferences in clinical outcomes.\n59\nDue to the potential overestimation of obstructive coronary disease by CTA, \nit may be advisable to perform additional testing for the presence of ischemia \nprior to revascularization in the asymptomatic individual.175,176with the administration of a vasodilator such as adenosine.186-188 The cut-off \npoint is 0.89 when compared to 0.80 for FFR.186 The initial clinical trials \nindicate that an iFR-guided revascularization strategy was non-inferior to an \nFFR-guided revascularization strategy.187,188\nFFR may also be assessed using CT. A recent meta-analysis showed that FFR\nCT achieves a moderate diagnostic performance for non-invasive              \nidentification of ischemic lesions in stable patients with suspected or known CAD in comparison to invasive FFR measurement.\n189 This tool is not yet \nwidely available.\n7.5.4.2  Intravascular Ultrasound / Optical Coherence Tomography\nFFR provides physiological assessment of the severity of a coronary lesion, \nwhile intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and optical coherence tomography \n(OCT) allow visual assessment of the lesion. IVUS makes use of the \nminimum lumen area (MLA) as the marker for significance of coronary \nstenosis. Overall, IVUS studies showed a relatively high negative predictive \nvalue but a low positive predictive value for ischemia.190\nBoth IVUS and OCT should not be performed to determine the functional significance of a coronary lesion before intervention.\n191 These are useful in \noptimizing stent deployment and determining the size of the vessel                   undergoing stent implantation.\n7.6  Guidelines for referral to a tertiary cardiac center\nFollowing risk stratification:\nLow risk individuals  should be managed with risk factor reduction and/or \nanti anginal medications as necessary. No further intervention is required. \nIntermediate risk individuals  may be managed with risk reduction \nstrategies +/- anti anginal therapy or considered for invasive coronary \nangiogram and revascularization depending on the clinical condition and \npatient preferences."

RISK STRATIFICATION IN STABLE CAD\nThe objectives of risk stratification in stable CAD are for: \n prognosis choosing the appropriate management strategy (e.g. revascularisation in high risk  \n groups)\nAbsolute levels of what constitutes high risk and low risk are not clearly defined for \nthose with stable CAD. There are several risk assessment scores for individuals with stable CAD using different CV end points.\n1,2,64,125-128\nThe ESC guidelines define risk as:44\n high risk - annual mortality of >3%\n intermediate risk - annual mortality of 1-3%\n low risk - annual mortality of <1%Patients with stable CAD should be risk stratified using the following parameters:\n clinical evaluation \n resting ECG \n assessment of left ventricular function\n non-invasive assessment of myocardial ischemia\n where indicated, evaluation of coronary anatomy and physiological  \n assessment of the significance of the coronary lesion\n7.1 Risk Stratification of Stable CAD by Clinical Evaluation\nImportant predictors of adverse outcomes in patients with stable CAD \nare:28,63,129–142\n  increasing age  prior MI  symptoms and signs of CHF\n  pattern of occurrence of angina (recent onset or progressive)\n  severity of angina, particularly if unresponsive to therapy\n  presence of atherosclerotic disease in other vascular beds - peripheral  \n  vessels, cerebral and/or aorta  presence of CV risk factors:\n    Diabetes\n    Hypertension\n    Metabolic syndrome\n    Current smoking\n    Dyslipidaemia\n    Family history of premature CAD\n  co-existing medical conditions:\n    Diabetes \n   Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)\n  psychosocial factors \n    Depression\n    Poor social support\nThe above adverse clinical predictors especially the severity of angina help \nmodulate decisions made based on non-invasive tests of ischemia and \nwhere indicated, physiological testing by Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR).In the diagnosis of CAD, these modalities are used in individuals who have \nintermediate PTP of CAD and who:\n  are unable to exercise adequately or\n  have exercise stress ECG with equivocal results or abnormal at moderate  \n  to high workloads, or \n  have un-interpretable ECG that makes interpretation of exercise stress  \n  ECG test difficult. \nIn the presence of LBBB and ventricular paced rhythms, stress imaging \ntechniques are the non-invasive tests of choice although the diagnostic \naccuracy in these situations, is reduced.\n82 \nIn patients with multivessel disease, imaging tests especially Stress MPI can sometimes underestimate the amount of myocardial ischemia. This is because these tests are based on the principle of perfusion differences \nbetween different myocardial territories and therefore require at least one \nnon-ischemic myocardial territory as a “normal” reference to be able to detect \ninducible myocardial ischemia in another territory. If all 3 vessels are                 \nsignificantly narrowed or there is a combination of left main and multivessel CAD, uniform tracer uptake due to “balanced” ischemia may lead to a rather \nhomogeneous tracer uptake and result in a false negative result.\n83-85\n6.2.2.1  Diagnostic Accuracy of Stress echocardiogram - exercise or  \n    pharmacological stress (dobutamine)\nThis is one of the least expensive and most widely available stress imaging \ntechniques.\nAn exercise stress echocardiogram is more physiological than pharmacological \nstress and is the stress of choice wherever possible.86,87\nPharmacological stress is preferred if the patient is unable to exercise or if \nthere are wall motion abnormalities seen at rest. The pharmacological stressor \nmost often used is dobutamine. The increase in cardiac workload seen with \ndobutamine is less than that with exercise. The addition of atropine augments \nthe sensitivity of the dobutamine stress echocardiogram (DSE).86,88 With the \nuse of dobutamine, viability can also be assessed.89\nThe marker for ischemia in stress echocardiogram is absence of wall thickening and inducible new or worsening wall motion abnormalities before, during and after the stress.\n86,87 If severe, there is also a decrease in LV ejection fraction and LV \nenlargement on stress.86,87 The presence of inducible wall motion abnormalities \nimplies significant limitation of blood flow at peak stress, and usually corresponds to a functionally significant stenosis, although the anatomic severity and physiologic \nconsequences are poorly related.\n86\nDSE has good sensitivity and specificity especially in the setting of multivessel \ndisease and previous MI.81,87,90-92 The interpretation is dependent on the adequacy of \nstress. In the diagnosis of CAD, the sensitivity of DSE is reduced in the presence of \nsingle vessel disease, small vessels and distal disease.86 It has greater use in \nprognostication of CAD and for the prediction of myocardial viability.86,87,91,93\nDSE has also a long learning curve and is relatively subjective relying on the human eye for the accurate assessment of myocardial motion. With the usage of myocardial contrast agents or microbubbles, endocardial border delineation is enhanced, and \nimage quality and diagnostic accuracy improved.\n94-96\n6.2.2.2.   Diagnostic Accuracy of Myocardial Perfusion Imaging (MPI) via  \n     SPECT \nMPI most commonly uses technetium-99m sestamibi as the radiotracer and SPECT \nfor imaging. Stress can be either by exercise or pharmacological agents -                    \nadenosine, dipyridamole or dobutamine.\nIschemia is indicated by reduced radiotracer uptake during stress when compared \nwith the uptake at rest. Transient ischaemic dilatation and reduced post-stress LV \nejection fraction are important predictors of severe CAD.\nSPECT detects a relative reduction in myocardial blood volume that occurs earlier \nthan wall thickening abnormality in the ischaemic cascade. Despite this, SPECT has \nnot been shown to be significantly superior to stress echocardiography in terms of \nsensitivity and detecting the extent of CAD.97 This is due to the poorer spatial         \nresolution of SPECT (12mm) as compared to stress echocardiography (2mm).91\nIn the diagnosis of CAD, MPI with SPECT has good sensitivity and specificity.98 The \ndiagnostic image quality is affected in obese patients, as well as in women with large \nbreasts. The diagnostic accuracy is also reduced in the presence of LBBB and \nventricular pacing.82,99 Other disadvantages are the use of ionizing radiation and its \ncost.6.2.2.3  Diagnostic Accuracy of Stress Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR)\nStress CMR with the use of dobutamine can be used to look at regional wall motion \nabnormalities similar to DSE and with a similar safety profile.100-102 In studies on \npatients with high disease prevalence, stress CMR demonstrated overall good sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of CAD.\n103-105 It is particularly useful in \npatients where it is difficult to acquire good echocardiographic images due to poor \nacoustic windows. \nPerfusion CMR (with adenosine) also has good diagnostic accuracy as compared to \nMPI (nuclear studies).101,105-107 It has also demonstrated good correlation with \nPressure wire (Fractional Flow Reserve) measurements.108\n6.3.  Anatomical testing in the Diagnosis of CAD\n6.3.1  Coronary Calcium Score (CAC)\nCalcium accumulates in coronary arteries in an age-related manner. Thus, all scores \nmust be adjusted for age, as well as for sex.109 The relationship of arterial calcification, \nlike that of angiographic coronary artery stenosis, to the probability of plaque rupture is unknown. Vulnerable plaques are frequently present in the absence of calcification.\n109\nCoronary calcium score has been used to detect CAD. Most studies demonstrated a high sensitivity but a much lower specificity, and an overall predictive accuracy of ≈70% in typical CAD patient populations.\n109 CAC was found not to be superior to other \nnon-invasive diagnostic modalities for the detection of CAD.109 In general, a negative \ntest (CAC =0):109\n  makes the presence of atherosclerotic plaques, including unstable plaques,  \n  very unlikely.  is highly unlikely in the presence of significant luminal obstructive disease.\n  occurs in most patients who have angiographically normal coronary arteries.\nCAC score is more useful in CV risk assessment. (Section 7.5.1, pg 56) \nIn the emergency room, CAC may be used in the triage of patients with a negative \nresting ECG and normal cardiac biomarkers. A CAC=0 has a high sensitivity and a \nvery high negative predictive value for CAD.\n110,1116.3.2  Diagnostic Accuracy of Computed Tomography Angiography  \n   (CTA)\nCTA allows visualization of the coronary arteries non-invasively. It can also \ndetermine the extent of coronary calcification, degree of luminal stenosis, degree of luminal remodelling and plaque characteristics. \nIt is usually done as a 2-stage procedure. The first being the quantification of \ncoronary calcium (CAC) and the second is the CTA. The 64-slice detector is \nthe minimum machine requirement. It has a negative predictive value of 93-99% and sensitivity and specificity of 90-94% and 95-97%                                respectively.\n112-120 It is most useful in the diagnostic assessment of individuals \nwith low or intermediate PTP of CAD.112–115\nCareful patient selection and preparation is integral to obtaining good images. These include:  patients with adequate breath holding capabilities.\n  absence of severe obesity.\n • a favourable calcium score (<400 Agatston score) and distribution.   presence of sinus rhythm (absence of ectopics).  heart rate of less than 65 beats per minute.\nA high coronary calcium score reduces the accuracy of the test.\n112 However, \nper-segment calcification (circumferential extent of calcium - arc calcium) has \na stronger influence on diagnostic accuracy than the total calcium score.121 \nCoronary CTA interpretation is less reliable in the presence of coronary stents of <3mm.\n122 In situations where the clinical presentation suggests \nlow-to-intermediate probability for restenosis and in the presence of larger stents, coronary CTA may be a reasonable alternative to invasive                      \nangiography to rule out significant in-stent restenosis.\n123\nIt is highly accurate in the assessment of coronary artery bypass grafts.124 \nThe interpretation of native coronary vessels in post bypass patients is \nhowever, more difficult.124\nCTA may be considered in:\n  individuals with low to intermediate PTP of CAD and who have mild or  \n  equivocal changes of ischemia in the exercise stress test or stress  \n  imaging tests and who are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic with  \n  good exercise capacity.112–115\n7.2 Risk Stratification of Stable CAD by Resting ECG\nResting ECG abnormalities can predict patients at greater risk of future CV \nevents than those with a normal ECG. These abnormalities \ninclude:63,127,133,135,143-145\n evidence of prior MI\n LBBB\n left anterior hemiblock, \n Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH)\n second or third-degree AV block atrial fibrillation (AF)\n7.3 Risk Stratification of Stable CAD by Left Ventricular Function\nLV function is the strongest predictor of survival. Patients with an LVEF of \n<50 % are already at high risk of CV death (annual mortality rate of >3%) \nwithout incorporating other risk factors.\n45,46,133,134,146,147\nIn the presence of a depressed LV function, it is important to determine if this is due to infarcted (scar) tissue or viable but stunned ischemic myocardium. \nThis can be done by stress imaging techniques. In the presence of ischemic \nbut viable myocardium, coronary revascularisation can result in an                    \nimprovement in LV function and survival.\n148\n7.4 Risk Stratification of Stable CAD by Non-invasive Testing \nNon-invasive tests provide useful information for prognostication. (Table 2, \npg 24) A negative test carries a good prognosis but the clinical evaluation \n(e.g. age, ability to exercise, exercise duration, co-morbidity such as \ndiabetes, CKD etc) and LV function should also be considered when              \nassessing CV risk. \nSmall imaging sub studies have shown mixed results when looking at CV \noutcomes in individuals with moderate to severe ischemia treated with \nrevascularization as compared to OMT.149–152 Two large clinical trials have not \nshown any advantage of revascularization as compared to OMT in these patients.\n76,153 In individuals with depressed LV function (LVEF ≤35%) CABG \ndid not reduce all-cause mortality but resulted in a reduction in CV mortality and hospitalizations.\n154 The ISCHEMIA trial is a large randomized clinical trial \nthat is currently underway specifically addressing the role of revascularisation \nversus OMT in patients with moderate to severe myocardial ischemia.155 \nIn patients with unprotected Left Main stem stenosis of > 50%, revascularisation \nby CABG has been shown to improve survival in the pivotal Coronary Artery \nSurgery Study (CASS) Registry.156  In view of this “the benefit of surgery over \nmedical treatment in patients with significant LMS stenosis (greater than 50%) is little argued.” \n157\n7.5.  Risk Stratification of Stable CAD by Anatomic testing\n \n7.5.1  Coronary Calcium (CAC) Score \nCAC scores help with CV risk stratification.158-163 (Table 8, pg 57) It guides risk \nreduction strategy, OMT and the need for further evaluation. CAC score alone was able to predict CHD risk independently of the           \nFramingham Risk Score.\n156,157 When used together with the traditional CV risk \nfactors, it had incremental value in CV risk prediction.164,165 There is a                \nsignificant correlation between CAC score and overall coronary artery         atherosclerotic plaque, with a high sensitivity >95% and a high negative \npredictive value of >95%.\n109,166,167 The CAC score was found to be highly \npredictive of CV risk in 4 ethnic groups - white, black, Hispanic, and \nChinese.168 \nPersons both asymptomatic and symptomatic, with a calcium score =0 have \na low CV event rate and an excellent long-term survival.167,169 However the \nPTP of disease and the clinical setting should be considered when                     \ninterpreting the test result. In interpreting a CAC =0:170\n if the PTP of CAD is low (e.g. asymptomatic individuals), there is low risk  \n of CAD and a low risk of near-term coronary events. \n in older asymptomatic patients with risk factors, there is a moderate   \n increased risk of CV events.\n in persons with clinical signs and symptoms associated with an intermediate  \n to high risk of CAD, there is often associated myocardial ischemia on  \n provocative testing and a high risk of near-term coronary events.1717.5.3  Risk Stratification by Invasive Coronary Angiography (ICA)  \nICA continues to be the “gold standard” in assessing coronary anatomy \nalthough it has its limitations. It cannot detect vulnerable plaques which are in \nmost cases not severe (<50% stenosis) but have a rich lipid core. \nDespite these limitations, the extent and site of coronary lesions provide good \nprognostic indicators. The prognosis is worse if: \n46,146,147\n  the greater the number of vessels involved. • there is left main stem stenosis of >50%.  the proximal LAD is involved.\nRecent large clinical trials did not however, show any improvement in clinical \noutcomes in patients with significant stable CAD when an initial strategy of \ncoronary revascularization was compared to intensive OMT.76,153,154\nIn patients who have unprotected left main stem stenosis, CABG has been \nshown to improve survival when compared to medical therapy in the large \nCASS registry.156 Although this trial was performed before the era of current \nintensive OMT, it is considered unethical to repeat it. \nCoronary arteriography should NOT be performed in patients: \n with angina who refuse invasive diagnostic procedures.\n• who prefer to avoid coronary revascularization either by PCI or CABG.\n who are not candidates for PCI or CABG. in whom PCI/CABG will not improve quality-of-life.\n7.5.4  Risk assessment by Physiological Assessment of the functional  \n   severity of coronary lesions \nCoronary angiography is of limited value in defining the functional                   \nsignificance of coronary stenosis. Yet the most important factor related to \noutcome is the presence and extent of inducible ischemia.\n177 If a stenosis is \nnot flow-limiting, it will not cause angina and the prognosis without coronary \nintervention is excellent, with a ‘hard’ event rate (cardiac death or non-fatal \nMI) of <1% per year.175 This event rate was not reduced with PCI and \nstenting.1757.5.4.1 Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR) \nThe functional severity of coronary lesions visualized angiographically may \nbe assessed invasively, by measuring the intracoronary artery pressure or \nFractional Flow Reserve (FFR). FFR is more accurate than visual                       assessment of the significance and severity of coronary lesions.\n176 Even in \nthe presence of angiographically insignificant stenosis, lesions with low FFR showed significantly higher event rates than those with high FFR.\n178\nFFR is presently considered as the ‘gold standard’ for invasive assessment of the significance of coronary stenosis and is useful in decision making in the \nneed for coronary revascularization. This: \n84\n  takes into consideration collateral blood flow.  takes into consideration the amount of viable myocardial mass.\n  is independent of haemodynamic variations.\n  has a high reproducibility. \nFFR is indicated for all coronary artery stenosis of 50-90%, including left main \nstenosis, side branch stenosis, tandem lesions and even in the setting of      \nnon-culprit lesions in ACS.\n84,179-181 In patients with multivessel CAD, PCI \nguided by FFR results in an improved outcome irrespective of available \nnon-invasive functional test results.182-184\nFFR is calculated as the ratio of distal coronary pressure to aortic pressure \nmeasured during maximal hyperaemia with either intracoronary or                        intravenous infusion of adenosine. A normal value for FFR is 1.0 regardless \nof the status of the microcirculation. In individuals on OMT with:\n84,179-184\n • FFR >0.80 - have no improved outcomes with revascularisation.\n  FFR between >0.75 but <0.8 - have intermediate benefit with                        \n  revascularisation and management should be based on clinical  \n  judgement.  • FFR <0.75 - benefit from revascularisation. \nUse of FFR accurately identifies which coronary lesions should be                       \nrevascularized and improves outcome. \nIt is recommended that in individuals with stable CAD, FFR be used to guide \nrevascularization of lesions of intermediate severity.\n182-185\nAt present, there are ongoing studies on the use of instantaneous wave-free \nratio (iFR), a pressure-derived index of stenosis severity that is not obtained 52\nTable 8: Coronary Calcium score and CV risk*#\n \n7.5.2  Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA)\nCTA may also be used for prognostication. There is a strong predictive value \nfor mortality and major CV events independent of traditional risk \nfactors.7-9,172-174\nIn assessing prognosis, in patients with: \n • absence of any plaque the CV event rate is low - 0.24% for CV   \n  death/non-fatal MI and an annual mortality of 0.28%.7,8\n  coronary plaque but without stenosis, the mortality rate is higher but  \n  remains below 0.5%.9\n • left main stenosis or proximal triple vessel disease - the hazard ratio for    all-cause mortality is 3.70.\n7\nDespite its’ excellent predictive value, in a randomized controlled trial comparing functional testing with MPI using SPECT and CTA as initial \ndiagnostic strategies in patients with suspected CAD, there were no \ndifferences in clinical outcomes.\n59\nDue to the potential overestimation of obstructive coronary disease by CTA, \nit may be advisable to perform additional testing for the presence of ischemia \nprior to revascularization in the asymptomatic individual.175,176with the administration of a vasodilator such as adenosine.186-188 The cut-off \npoint is 0.89 when compared to 0.80 for FFR.186 The initial clinical trials \nindicate that an iFR-guided revascularization strategy was non-inferior to an \nFFR-guided revascularization strategy.187,188\nFFR may also be assessed using CT. A recent meta-analysis showed that FFR\nCT achieves a moderate diagnostic performance for non-invasive              \nidentification of ischemic lesions in stable patients with suspected or known CAD in comparison to invasive FFR measurement.\n189 This tool is not yet \nwidely available.\n7.5.4.2  Intravascular Ultrasound / Optical Coherence Tomography\nFFR provides physiological assessment of the severity of a coronary lesion, \nwhile intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and optical coherence tomography \n(OCT) allow visual assessment of the lesion. IVUS makes use of the \nminimum lumen area (MLA) as the marker for significance of coronary \nstenosis. Overall, IVUS studies showed a relatively high negative predictive \nvalue but a low positive predictive value for ischemia.190\nBoth IVUS and OCT should not be performed to determine the functional significance of a coronary lesion before intervention.\n191 These are useful in \noptimizing stent deployment and determining the size of the vessel                   undergoing stent implantation.\n7.6  Guidelines for referral to a tertiary cardiac center\nFollowing risk stratification:\nLow risk individuals  should be managed with risk factor reduction and/or \nanti anginal medications as necessary. No further intervention is required. \nIntermediate risk individuals  may be managed with risk reduction \nstrategies +/- anti anginal therapy or considered for invasive coronary \nangiogram and revascularization depending on the clinical condition and \npatient preferences."

The diagnostic \nperformance of these modalities is almost similar and the preference to use one \nimaging modality or the other depends on local expertise and availability.3,81\nThe choice of stress imaging technique will depend on:\n  the patient - ability to exercise, obesity, lung problems which may affect image  \n  quality. \n  local resources and expertise.\nPrior to performing the test, the following should be considered:\n  the modality is performed and interpreted by adequately trained personnel.\n  each modality of testing has its own inherent risk e.g. radiation, contrast  \n  sensitivity, bodily injury and interpretation error which should be explained to  \n  the patient.   \nCTA should not be used as a screening test for CAD in the asymptomatic \nindividual. \nDue to the low prevalence of disease in most individuals undergoing health \nscreening, there tends to be too many false-positive lesions. Also, many minor lesions not causing ischemia may be found, potentially resulting in \nunnecessary downstream invasive procedures and intervention.\n6.3.3  Diagnostic Accuracy of Invasive Coronary Angiography (ICA)\nInvasive Coronary angiography has been the “gold standard” for the                 \ndiagnosis of CAD. It can detect obstructive lesions with negative remodelling \naccurately but unlike CTA, it may not be able to detect non-obstructive \nlesions with positive remodelling where the lumen diameter may be \nmaintained.\nICA is rarely necessary in stable patients with suspected CAD for the sole \npurpose of establishing the diagnosis of CAD.

The diagnostic accuracy is also reduced in the presence of LBBB and \nventricular pacing.82,99 Other disadvantages are the use of ionizing radiation and its \ncost.6.2.2.3  Diagnostic Accuracy of Stress Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR)\nStress CMR with the use of dobutamine can be used to look at regional wall motion \nabnormalities similar to DSE and with a similar safety profile.100-102 In studies on \npatients with high disease prevalence, stress CMR demonstrated overall good sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of CAD.\n103-105 It is particularly useful in \npatients where it is difficult to acquire good echocardiographic images due to poor \nacoustic windows. \nPerfusion CMR (with adenosine) also has good diagnostic accuracy as compared to \nMPI (nuclear studies).101,105-107 It has also demonstrated good correlation with \nPressure wire (Fractional Flow Reserve) measurements.108\n6.3.  Anatomical testing in the Diagnosis of CAD\n6.3.1  Coronary Calcium Score (CAC)\nCalcium accumulates in coronary arteries in an age-related manner. Thus, all scores \nmust be adjusted for age, as well as for sex.109 The relationship of arterial calcification, \nlike that of angiographic coronary artery stenosis, to the probability of plaque rupture is unknown. Vulnerable plaques are frequently present in the absence of calcification.\n109\nCoronary calcium score has been used to detect CAD. Most studies demonstrated a high sensitivity but a much lower specificity, and an overall predictive accuracy of ≈70% in typical CAD patient populations.\n109 CAC was found not to be superior to other \nnon-invasive diagnostic modalities for the detection of CAD.109 In general, a negative \ntest (CAC =0):109\n  makes the presence of atherosclerotic plaques, including unstable plaques,  \n  very unlikely.  is highly unlikely in the presence of significant luminal obstructive disease.\n  occurs in most patients who have angiographically normal coronary arteries.\nCAC score is more useful in CV risk assessment. (Section 7.5.1, pg 56) \nIn the emergency room, CAC may be used in the triage of patients with a negative \nresting ECG and normal cardiac biomarkers. A CAC=0 has a high sensitivity and a \nvery high negative predictive value for CAD.\n110,1116.3.2  Diagnostic Accuracy of Computed Tomography Angiography  \n   (CTA)\nCTA allows visualization of the coronary arteries non-invasively. It can also \ndetermine the extent of coronary calcification, degree of luminal stenosis, degree of luminal remodelling and plaque characteristics. \nIt is usually done as a 2-stage procedure. The first being the quantification of \ncoronary calcium (CAC) and the second is the CTA. The 64-slice detector is \nthe minimum machine requirement. It has a negative predictive value of 93-99% and sensitivity and specificity of 90-94% and 95-97%                                respectively.\n112-120 It is most useful in the diagnostic assessment of individuals \nwith low or intermediate PTP of CAD.112–115\nCareful patient selection and preparation is integral to obtaining good images. These include:  patients with adequate breath holding capabilities.\n  absence of severe obesity.\n • a favourable calcium score (<400 Agatston score) and distribution.   presence of sinus rhythm (absence of ectopics).  heart rate of less than 65 beats per minute.\nA high coronary calcium score reduces the accuracy of the test.\n112 However, \nper-segment calcification (circumferential extent of calcium - arc calcium) has \na stronger influence on diagnostic accuracy than the total calcium score.121 \nCoronary CTA interpretation is less reliable in the presence of coronary stents of <3mm.\n122 In situations where the clinical presentation suggests \nlow-to-intermediate probability for restenosis and in the presence of larger stents, coronary CTA may be a reasonable alternative to invasive                      \nangiography to rule out significant in-stent restenosis.\n123\nIt is highly accurate in the assessment of coronary artery bypass grafts.124 \nThe interpretation of native coronary vessels in post bypass patients is \nhowever, more difficult.124\nCTA may be considered in:\n  individuals with low to intermediate PTP of CAD and who have mild or  \n  equivocal changes of ischemia in the exercise stress test or stress  \n  imaging tests and who are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic with  \n  good exercise capacity.112–115\n7.2 Risk Stratification of Stable CAD by Resting ECG\nResting ECG abnormalities can predict patients at greater risk of future CV \nevents than those with a normal ECG. These abnormalities \ninclude:63,127,133,135,143-145\n evidence of prior MI\n LBBB\n left anterior hemiblock, \n Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH)\n second or third-degree AV block atrial fibrillation (AF)\n7.3 Risk Stratification of Stable CAD by Left Ventricular Function\nLV function is the strongest predictor of survival. Patients with an LVEF of \n<50 % are already at high risk of CV death (annual mortality rate of >3%) \nwithout incorporating other risk factors.\n45,46,133,134,146,147\nIn the presence of a depressed LV function, it is important to determine if this is due to infarcted (scar) tissue or viable but stunned ischemic myocardium. \nThis can be done by stress imaging techniques. In the presence of ischemic \nbut viable myocardium, coronary revascularisation can result in an                    \nimprovement in LV function and survival.\n148\n7.4 Risk Stratification of Stable CAD by Non-invasive Testing \nNon-invasive tests provide useful information for prognostication. (Table 2, \npg 24) A negative test carries a good prognosis but the clinical evaluation \n(e.g. age, ability to exercise, exercise duration, co-morbidity such as \ndiabetes, CKD etc) and LV function should also be considered when              \nassessing CV risk. \nSmall imaging sub studies have shown mixed results when looking at CV \noutcomes in individuals with moderate to severe ischemia treated with \nrevascularization as compared to OMT.149–152 Two large clinical trials have not \nshown any advantage of revascularization as compared to OMT in these patients.\n76,153 In individuals with depressed LV function (LVEF ≤35%) CABG \ndid not reduce all-cause mortality but resulted in a reduction in CV mortality and hospitalizations.\n154 The ISCHEMIA trial is a large randomized clinical trial \nthat is currently underway specifically addressing the role of revascularisation \nversus OMT in patients with moderate to severe myocardial ischemia.155 \nIn patients with unprotected Left Main stem stenosis of > 50%, revascularisation \nby CABG has been shown to improve survival in the pivotal Coronary Artery \nSurgery Study (CASS) Registry.156  In view of this “the benefit of surgery over \nmedical treatment in patients with significant LMS stenosis (greater than 50%) is little argued.” \n157\n7.5.  Risk Stratification of Stable CAD by Anatomic testing\n \n7.5.1  Coronary Calcium (CAC) Score \nCAC scores help with CV risk stratification.158-163 (Table 8, pg 57) It guides risk \nreduction strategy, OMT and the need for further evaluation. CAC score alone was able to predict CHD risk independently of the           \nFramingham Risk Score.\n156,157 When used together with the traditional CV risk \nfactors, it had incremental value in CV risk prediction.164,165 There is a                \nsignificant correlation between CAC score and overall coronary artery         atherosclerotic plaque, with a high sensitivity >95% and a high negative \npredictive value of >95%.\n109,166,167 The CAC score was found to be highly \npredictive of CV risk in 4 ethnic groups - white, black, Hispanic, and \nChinese.168 \nPersons both asymptomatic and symptomatic, with a calcium score =0 have \na low CV event rate and an excellent long-term survival.167,169 However the \nPTP of disease and the clinical setting should be considered when                     \ninterpreting the test result. In interpreting a CAC =0:170\n if the PTP of CAD is low (e.g. asymptomatic individuals), there is low risk  \n of CAD and a low risk of near-term coronary events. \n in older asymptomatic patients with risk factors, there is a moderate   \n increased risk of CV events.\n in persons with clinical signs and symptoms associated with an intermediate  \n to high risk of CAD, there is often associated myocardial ischemia on  \n provocative testing and a high risk of near-term coronary events.171\nRecommendation 1:\nIn the diagnosis of CAD in patients having stable chest pain/angina equivalent:\n Exercise stress ECG is the non-invasive test of choice in patients who can  \n exercise and have interpretable ECGs.\n Stress imaging tests are used in individuals who have intermediate PTP of  \n CAD and who:  are unable to exercise adequately and/or\n  have uninterpretable resting ECG and/or\n  have exercise stress ECG with equivocal results or which are abnormal at  \n  moderate to high workloads depending upon the clinical condition.\n Coronary Calcium has been used to detect CAD but is more useful for CV risk  \n assessment.\n CTA: \n  May be considered in individuals with low to intermediate risk PTP of CAD  \n  and who have mild or equivocal changes of ischemia in the exercise stress  \n  test or stress imaging tests and who are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic  \n  with good exercise capacity.\n Invasive Coronary Angiogram (ICA)\n ICA is rarely necessary in stable patients with suspected CAD for the sole  \n purpose of establishing the diagnosis of CAD.  It is indicated, following  \n non-invasive risk stratification, to determine the most appropriate mode of  \n revascularization.\n7.5.3  Risk Stratification by Invasive Coronary Angiography (ICA)  \nICA continues to be the “gold standard” in assessing coronary anatomy \nalthough it has its limitations. It cannot detect vulnerable plaques which are in \nmost cases not severe (<50% stenosis) but have a rich lipid core. \nDespite these limitations, the extent and site of coronary lesions provide good \nprognostic indicators. The prognosis is worse if: \n46,146,147\n  the greater the number of vessels involved. • there is left main stem stenosis of >50%.  the proximal LAD is involved.\nRecent large clinical trials did not however, show any improvement in clinical \noutcomes in patients with significant stable CAD when an initial strategy of \ncoronary revascularization was compared to intensive OMT.\n76,153,154\nIn patients who have unprotected left main stem stenosis, CABG has been shown to improve survival when compared to medical therapy in the large \nCASS registry.\n156 Although this trial was performed before the era of current \nintensive OMT, it is considered unethical to repeat it. \nCoronary arteriography should NOT be performed in patients: \n with angina who refuse invasive diagnostic procedures.\n• who prefer to avoid coronary revascularization either by PCI or CABG.\n who are not candidates for PCI or CABG. in whom PCI/CABG will not improve quality-of-life.\n7.5.4  Risk assessment by Physiological Assessment of the functional  \n   severity of coronary lesions \nCoronary angiography is of limited value in defining the functional                   \nsignificance of coronary stenosis. Yet the most important factor related to \noutcome is the presence and extent of inducible ischemia.\n177 If a stenosis is \nnot flow-limiting, it will not cause angina and the prognosis without coronary \nintervention is excellent, with a ‘hard’ event rate (cardiac death or non-fatal \nMI) of <1% per year.175 This event rate was not reduced with PCI and \nstenting.1757.5.4.1 Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR) \nThe functional severity of coronary lesions visualized angiographically may \nbe assessed invasively, by measuring the intracoronary artery pressure or \nFractional Flow Reserve (FFR). FFR is more accurate than visual                       assessment of the significance and severity of coronary lesions.\n176 Even in \nthe presence of angiographically insignificant stenosis, lesions with low FFR showed significantly higher event rates than those with high FFR.\n178\nFFR is presently considered as the ‘gold standard’ for invasive assessment of the significance of coronary stenosis and is useful in decision making in the \nneed for coronary revascularization. This: \n84\n  takes into consideration collateral blood flow.  takes into consideration the amount of viable myocardial mass.\n  is independent of haemodynamic variations.\n  has a high reproducibility. \nFFR is indicated for all coronary artery stenosis of 50-90%, including left main \nstenosis, side branch stenosis, tandem lesions and even in the setting of      \nnon-culprit lesions in ACS.\n84,179-181 In patients with multivessel CAD, PCI \nguided by FFR results in an improved outcome irrespective of available \nnon-invasive functional test results.182-184\nFFR is calculated as the ratio of distal coronary pressure to aortic pressure \nmeasured during maximal hyperaemia with either intracoronary or                        intravenous infusion of adenosine. A normal value for FFR is 1.0 regardless \nof the status of the microcirculation. In individuals on OMT with:\n84,179-184\n • FFR >0.80 - have no improved outcomes with revascularisation.\n  FFR between >0.75 but <0.8 - have intermediate benefit with                        \n  revascularisation and management should be based on clinical  \n  judgement.  • FFR <0.75 - benefit from revascularisation. \nUse of FFR accurately identifies which coronary lesions should be                       \nrevascularized and improves outcome. \nIt is recommended that in individuals with stable CAD, FFR be used to guide \nrevascularization of lesions of intermediate severity.\n182-185\nAt present, there are ongoing studies on the use of instantaneous wave-free \nratio (iFR), a pressure-derived index of stenosis severity that is not obtained Table 8: Coronary Calcium score and CV risk*#\n \n7.5.2  Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA)\nCTA may also be used for prognostication. There is a strong predictive value \nfor mortality and major CV events independent of traditional risk \nfactors.7-9,172-174\nIn assessing prognosis, in patients with: \n • absence of any plaque the CV event rate is low - 0.24% for CV   \n  death/non-fatal MI and an annual mortality of 0.28%.7,8\n  coronary plaque but without stenosis, the mortality rate is higher but  \n  remains below 0.5%.9\n • left main stenosis or proximal triple vessel disease - the hazard ratio for    all-cause mortality is 3.70.\n7\nDespite its’ excellent predictive value, in a randomized controlled trial comparing functional testing with MPI using SPECT and CTA as initial \ndiagnostic strategies in patients with suspected CAD, there were no \ndifferences in clinical outcomes.\n59\nDue to the potential overestimation of obstructive coronary disease by CTA, \nit may be advisable to perform additional testing for the presence of ischemia \nprior to revascularization in the asymptomatic individual.175,176with the administration of a vasodilator such as adenosine.186-188 The cut-off \npoint is 0.89 when compared to 0.80 for FFR.186 The initial clinical trials \nindicate that an iFR-guided revascularization strategy was non-inferior to an \nFFR-guided revascularization strategy.187,188\nFFR may also be assessed using CT. A recent meta-analysis showed that FFR\nCT achieves a moderate diagnostic performance for non-invasive              \nidentification of ischemic lesions in stable patients with suspected or known CAD in comparison to invasive FFR measurement.\n189 This tool is not yet \nwidely available.\n7.5.4.2  Intravascular Ultrasound / Optical Coherence Tomography\nFFR provides physiological assessment of the severity of a coronary lesion, \nwhile intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and optical coherence tomography \n(OCT) allow visual assessment of the lesion. IVUS makes use of the \nminimum lumen area (MLA) as the marker for significance of coronary \nstenosis. Overall, IVUS studies showed a relatively high negative predictive \nvalue but a low positive predictive value for ischemia.190\nBoth IVUS and OCT should not be performed to determine the functional significance of a coronary lesion before intervention.\n191 These are useful in \noptimizing stent deployment and determining the size of the vessel                   undergoing stent implantation.\n7.6  Guidelines for referral to a tertiary cardiac center\nFollowing risk stratification:\nLow risk individuals  should be managed with risk factor reduction and/or \nanti anginal medications as necessary. No further intervention is required. \nIntermediate risk individuals  may be managed with risk reduction \nstrategies +/- anti anginal therapy or considered for invasive coronary \nangiogram and revascularization depending on the clinical condition and \npatient preferences."

The diagnostic \nperformance of these modalities is almost similar and the preference to use one \nimaging modality or the other depends on local expertise and availability.3,81\nThe choice of stress imaging technique will depend on:\n  the patient - ability to exercise, obesity, lung problems which may affect image  \n  quality. \n  local resources and expertise.\nPrior to performing the test, the following should be considered:\n  the modality is performed and interpreted by adequately trained personnel.\n  each modality of testing has its own inherent risk e.g. radiation, contrast  \n  sensitivity, bodily injury and interpretation error which should be explained to  \n  the patient.   \nCTA should not be used as a screening test for CAD in the asymptomatic \nindividual. \nDue to the low prevalence of disease in most individuals undergoing health \nscreening, there tends to be too many false-positive lesions. Also, many minor lesions not causing ischemia may be found, potentially resulting in \nunnecessary downstream invasive procedures and intervention.\n6.3.3  Diagnostic Accuracy of Invasive Coronary Angiography (ICA)\nInvasive Coronary angiography has been the “gold standard” for the                 \ndiagnosis of CAD. It can detect obstructive lesions with negative remodelling \naccurately but unlike CTA, it may not be able to detect non-obstructive \nlesions with positive remodelling where the lumen diameter may be \nmaintained.\nICA is rarely necessary in stable patients with suspected CAD for the sole \npurpose of establishing the diagnosis of CAD. It is indicated, following       \nnon-invasive risk stratification, to determine the most appropriate mode of \nrevascularization. \n7.  RISK STRATIFICATION IN STABLE CAD\nThe objectives of risk stratification in stable CAD are for: \n prognosis choosing the appropriate management strategy (e.g. revascularisation in high risk  \n groups)\nAbsolute levels of what constitutes high risk and low risk are not clearly defined for \nthose with stable CAD. There are several risk assessment scores for individuals with stable CAD using different CV end points.\n1,2,64,125-128\nThe ESC guidelines define risk as:44\n high risk - annual mortality of >3%\n intermediate risk - annual mortality of 1-3%\n low risk - annual mortality of <1%Patients with stable CAD should be risk stratified using the following parameters:\n clinical evaluation \n resting ECG \n assessment of left ventricular function\n non-invasive assessment of myocardial ischemia where indicated, evaluation of coronary anatomy and physiological  \n assessment of the significance of the coronary lesion\n7.1 Risk Stratification of Stable CAD by Clinical Evaluation\nImportant predictors of adverse outcomes in patients with stable CAD \nare:\n28,63,129–142\n  increasing age  prior MI  symptoms and signs of CHF\n  pattern of occurrence of angina (recent onset or progressive)\n  severity of angina, particularly if unresponsive to therapy\n  presence of atherosclerotic disease in other vascular beds - peripheral  \n  vessels, cerebral and/or aorta  presence of CV risk factors:\n    Diabetes\n    Hypertension\n    Metabolic syndrome\n    Current smoking\n    Dyslipidaemia\n    Family history of premature CAD\n  co-existing medical conditions:\n    Diabetes \n   Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)\n  psychosocial factors \n    Depression\n    Poor social support\nThe above adverse clinical predictors especially the severity of angina help \nmodulate decisions made based on non-invasive tests of ischemia and \nwhere indicated, physiological testing by Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR).In the diagnosis of CAD, these modalities are used in individuals who have \nintermediate PTP of CAD and who:\n  are unable to exercise adequately or\n  have exercise stress ECG with equivocal results or abnormal at moderate  \n  to high workloads, or   have un-interpretable ECG that makes interpretation of exercise stress  \n  ECG test difficult. \nIn the presence of LBBB and ventricular paced rhythms, stress imaging \ntechniques are the non-invasive tests of choice although the diagnostic accuracy in these situations, is reduced.\n82 \nIn patients with multivessel disease, imaging tests especially Stress MPI can sometimes underestimate the amount of myocardial ischemia. This is because these tests are based on the principle of perfusion differences \nbetween different myocardial territories and therefore require at least one \nnon-ischemic myocardial territory as a “normal” reference to be able to detect \ninducible myocardial ischemia in another territory. If all 3 vessels are                 \nsignificantly narrowed or there is a combination of left main and multivessel CAD, uniform tracer uptake due to “balanced” ischemia may lead to a rather \nhomogeneous tracer uptake and result in a false negative result.\n83-85\n6.2.2.1  Diagnostic Accuracy of Stress echocardiogram - exercise or  \n    pharmacological stress (dobutamine)\nThis is one of the least expensive and most widely available stress imaging \ntechniques.\nAn exercise stress echocardiogram is more physiological than pharmacological \nstress and is the stress of choice wherever possible.86,87\nPharmacological stress is preferred if the patient is unable to exercise or if \nthere are wall motion abnormalities seen at rest. The pharmacological stressor \nmost often used is dobutamine. The increase in cardiac workload seen with \ndobutamine is less than that with exercise. The addition of atropine augments \nthe sensitivity of the dobutamine stress echocardiogram (DSE).86,88 With the \nuse of dobutamine, viability can also be assessed.89\nThe marker for ischemia in stress echocardiogram is absence of wall thickening and inducible new or worsening wall motion abnormalities before, during and after the stress.\n86,87 If severe, there is also a decrease in LV ejection fraction and LV \nenlargement on stress.86,87 The presence of inducible wall motion abnormalities \nimplies significant limitation of blood flow at peak stress, and usually corresponds to a functionally significant stenosis, although the anatomic severity and physiologic \nconsequences are poorly related.\n86\nDSE has good sensitivity and specificity especially in the setting of multivessel \ndisease and previous MI.81,87,90-92 The interpretation is dependent on the adequacy of \nstress. In the diagnosis of CAD, the sensitivity of DSE is reduced in the presence of \nsingle vessel disease, small vessels and distal disease.86 It has greater use in \nprognostication of CAD and for the prediction of myocardial viability.86,87,91,93\nDSE has also a long learning curve and is relatively subjective relying on the human eye for the accurate assessment of myocardial motion. With the usage of myocardial contrast agents or microbubbles, endocardial border delineation is enhanced, and \nimage quality and diagnostic accuracy improved.\n94-96\n6.2.2.2.   Diagnostic Accuracy of Myocardial Perfusion Imaging (MPI) via  \n     SPECT \nMPI most commonly uses technetium-99m sestamibi as the radiotracer and SPECT \nfor imaging. Stress can be either by exercise or pharmacological agents -                    \nadenosine, dipyridamole or dobutamine.\nIschemia is indicated by reduced radiotracer uptake during stress when compared \nwith the uptake at rest. Transient ischaemic dilatation and reduced post-stress LV \nejection fraction are important predictors of severe CAD.\nSPECT detects a relative reduction in myocardial blood volume that occurs earlier \nthan wall thickening abnormality in the ischaemic cascade. Despite this, SPECT has \nnot been shown to be significantly superior to stress echocardiography in terms of \nsensitivity and detecting the extent of CAD.97 This is due to the poorer spatial         \nresolution of SPECT (12mm) as compared to stress echocardiography (2mm).91\nIn the diagnosis of CAD, MPI with SPECT has good sensitivity and specificity.98 The \ndiagnostic image quality is affected in obese patients, as well as in women with large \nbreasts. The diagnostic accuracy is also reduced in the presence of LBBB and \nventricular pacing.82,99 Other disadvantages are the use of ionizing radiation and its \ncost.6.2.2.3  Diagnostic Accuracy of Stress Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR)\nStress CMR with the use of dobutamine can be used to look at regional wall motion \nabnormalities similar to DSE and with a similar safety profile.100-102 In studies on \npatients with high disease prevalence, stress CMR demonstrated overall good sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of CAD.\n103-105 It is particularly useful in \npatients where it is difficult to acquire good echocardiographic images due to poor \nacoustic windows. \nPerfusion CMR (with adenosine) also has good diagnostic accuracy as compared to \nMPI (nuclear studies).101,105-107 It has also demonstrated good correlation with \nPressure wire (Fractional Flow Reserve) measurements.108\n6.3.  Anatomical testing in the Diagnosis of CAD\n6.3.1  Coronary Calcium Score (CAC)\nCalcium accumulates in coronary arteries in an age-related manner. Thus, all scores \nmust be adjusted for age, as well as for sex.109 The relationship of arterial calcification, \nlike that of angiographic coronary artery stenosis, to the probability of plaque rupture is unknown. Vulnerable plaques are frequently present in the absence of calcification.\n109\nCoronary calcium score has been used to detect CAD. Most studies demonstrated a high sensitivity but a much lower specificity, and an overall predictive accuracy of ≈70% in typical CAD patient populations.\n109 CAC was found not to be superior to other \nnon-invasive diagnostic modalities for the detection of CAD.109 In general, a negative \ntest (CAC =0):109\n  makes the presence of atherosclerotic plaques, including unstable plaques,  \n  very unlikely.  is highly unlikely in the presence of significant luminal obstructive disease.\n  occurs in most patients who have angiographically normal coronary arteries.\nCAC score is more useful in CV risk assessment. (Section 7.5.1, pg 56) \nIn the emergency room, CAC may be used in the triage of patients with a negative \nresting ECG and normal cardiac biomarkers. A CAC=0 has a high sensitivity and a \nvery high negative predictive value for CAD.\n110,1116.3.2  Diagnostic Accuracy of Computed Tomography Angiography  \n   (CTA)\nCTA allows visualization of the coronary arteries non-invasively.

(Table 2, \npg 24) A negative test carries a good prognosis but the clinical evaluation \n(e.g. age, ability to exercise, exercise duration, co-morbidity such as \ndiabetes, CKD etc) and LV function should also be considered when              \nassessing CV risk. \nSmall imaging sub studies have shown mixed results when looking at CV \noutcomes in individuals with moderate to severe ischemia treated with \nrevascularization as compared to OMT.149–152 Two large clinical trials have not \nshown any advantage of revascularization as compared to OMT in these patients.\n76,153 In individuals with depressed LV function (LVEF ≤35%) CABG \ndid not reduce all-cause mortality but resulted in a reduction in CV mortality and hospitalizations.\n154 The ISCHEMIA trial is a large randomized clinical trial \nthat is currently underway specifically addressing the role of revascularisation \nversus OMT in patients with moderate to severe myocardial ischemia.155 \nIn patients with unprotected Left Main stem stenosis of > 50%, revascularisation \nby CABG has been shown to improve survival in the pivotal Coronary Artery \nSurgery Study (CASS) Registry.156  In view of this “the benefit of surgery over \nmedical treatment in patients with significant LMS stenosis (greater than 50%) is little argued.” \n157\n7.5.  Risk Stratification of Stable CAD by Anatomic testing\n \n7.5.1  Coronary Calcium (CAC) Score \nCAC scores help with CV risk stratification.158-163 (Table 8, pg 57) It guides risk \nreduction strategy, OMT and the need for further evaluation. CAC score alone was able to predict CHD risk independently of the           \nFramingham Risk Score.\n156,157 When used together with the traditional CV risk \nfactors, it had incremental value in CV risk prediction.164,165 There is a                \nsignificant correlation between CAC score and overall coronary artery         atherosclerotic plaque, with a high sensitivity >95% and a high negative \npredictive value of >95%.\n109,166,167 The CAC score was found to be highly \npredictive of CV risk in 4 ethnic groups - white, black, Hispanic, and \nChinese.168 \nPersons both asymptomatic and symptomatic, with a calcium score =0 have \na low CV event rate and an excellent long-term survival.167,169 However the \nPTP of disease and the clinical setting should be considered when                     \ninterpreting the test result. In interpreting a CAC =0:170\n if the PTP of CAD is low (e.g. asymptomatic individuals), there is low risk  \n of CAD and a low risk of near-term coronary events. \n in older asymptomatic patients with risk factors, there is a moderate   \n increased risk of CV events.\n in persons with clinical signs and symptoms associated with an intermediate  \n to high risk of CAD, there is often associated myocardial ischemia on  \n provocative testing and a high risk of near-term coronary events.1717.5.3  Risk Stratification by Invasive Coronary Angiography (ICA)  \nICA continues to be the “gold standard” in assessing coronary anatomy \nalthough it has its limitations. It cannot detect vulnerable plaques which are in \nmost cases not severe (<50% stenosis) but have a rich lipid core. \nDespite these limitations, the extent and site of coronary lesions provide good \nprognostic indicators. The prognosis is worse if: \n46,146,147\n  the greater the number of vessels involved. • there is left main stem stenosis of >50%.  the proximal LAD is involved.\nRecent large clinical trials did not however, show any improvement in clinical \noutcomes in patients with significant stable CAD when an initial strategy of \ncoronary revascularization was compared to intensive OMT.\n76,153,154\nIn patients who have unprotected left main stem stenosis, CABG has been shown to improve survival when compared to medical therapy in the large \nCASS registry.\n156 Although this trial was performed before the era of current \nintensive OMT, it is considered unethical to repeat it. \nCoronary arteriography should NOT be performed in patients: \n with angina who refuse invasive diagnostic procedures.\n• who prefer to avoid coronary revascularization either by PCI or CABG.\n who are not candidates for PCI or CABG. in whom PCI/CABG will not improve quality-of-life.\n7.5.4  Risk assessment by Physiological Assessment of the functional  \n   severity of coronary lesions \nCoronary angiography is of limited value in defining the functional                   \nsignificance of coronary stenosis. Yet the most important factor related to \noutcome is the presence and extent of inducible ischemia.\n177 If a stenosis is \nnot flow-limiting, it will not cause angina and the prognosis without coronary \nintervention is excellent, with a ‘hard’ event rate (cardiac death or non-fatal \nMI) of <1% per year.175 This event rate was not reduced with PCI and \nstenting.1757.5.4.1 Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR) \nThe functional severity of coronary lesions visualized angiographically may \nbe assessed invasively, by measuring the intracoronary artery pressure or \nFractional Flow Reserve (FFR). FFR is more accurate than visual                       assessment of the significance and severity of coronary lesions.\n176 Even in \nthe presence of angiographically insignificant stenosis, lesions with low FFR showed significantly higher event rates than those with high FFR.\n178\nFFR is presently considered as the ‘gold standard’ for invasive assessment of the significance of coronary stenosis and is useful in decision making in the \nneed for coronary revascularization. This: \n84\n  takes into consideration collateral blood flow.  takes into consideration the amount of viable myocardial mass.\n  is independent of haemodynamic variations.\n  has a high reproducibility. \nFFR is indicated for all coronary artery stenosis of 50-90%, including left main \nstenosis, side branch stenosis, tandem lesions and even in the setting of      \nnon-culprit lesions in ACS.\n84,179-181 In patients with multivessel CAD, PCI \nguided by FFR results in an improved outcome irrespective of available \nnon-invasive functional test results.182-184\nFFR is calculated as the ratio of distal coronary pressure to aortic pressure \nmeasured during maximal hyperaemia with either intracoronary or                        intravenous infusion of adenosine. A normal value for FFR is 1.0 regardless \nof the status of the microcirculation. In individuals on OMT with:\n84,179-184\n • FFR >0.80 - have no improved outcomes with revascularisation.\n  FFR between >0.75 but <0.8 - have intermediate benefit with                        \n  revascularisation and management should be based on clinical  \n  judgement.  • FFR <0.75 - benefit from revascularisation. \nUse of FFR accurately identifies which coronary lesions should be                       \nrevascularized and improves outcome. \nIt is recommended that in individuals with stable CAD, FFR be used to guide \nrevascularization of lesions of intermediate severity.\n182-185\nAt present, there are ongoing studies on the use of instantaneous wave-free \nratio (iFR), a pressure-derived index of stenosis severity that is not obtained I, B\nTable 8: Coronary Calcium score and CV risk*#\n \n7.5.2  Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA)\nCTA may also be used for prognostication. There is a strong predictive value \nfor mortality and major CV events independent of traditional risk \nfactors.7-9,172-174\nIn assessing prognosis, in patients with: \n • absence of any plaque the CV event rate is low - 0.24% for CV   \n  death/non-fatal MI and an annual mortality of 0.28%.7,8\n  coronary plaque but without stenosis, the mortality rate is higher but  \n  remains below 0.5%.9\n • left main stenosis or proximal triple vessel disease - the hazard ratio for    all-cause mortality is 3.70.\n7\nDespite its’ excellent predictive value, in a randomized controlled trial comparing functional testing with MPI using SPECT and CTA as initial \ndiagnostic strategies in patients with suspected CAD, there were no \ndifferences in clinical outcomes.\n59\nDue to the potential overestimation of obstructive coronary disease by CTA, \nit may be advisable to perform additional testing for the presence of ischemia \nprior to revascularization in the asymptomatic individual.175,176with the administration of a vasodilator such as adenosine.186-188 The cut-off \npoint is 0.89 when compared to 0.80 for FFR.186 The initial clinical trials \nindicate that an iFR-guided revascularization strategy was non-inferior to an \nFFR-guided revascularization strategy.187,188\nFFR may also be assessed using CT. A recent meta-analysis showed that FFR\nCT achieves a moderate diagnostic performance for non-invasive              \nidentification of ischemic lesions in stable patients with suspected or known CAD in comparison to invasive FFR measurement.\n189 This tool is not yet \nwidely available.\n7.5.4.2  Intravascular Ultrasound / Optical Coherence Tomography\nFFR provides physiological assessment of the severity of a coronary lesion, \nwhile intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and optical coherence tomography \n(OCT) allow visual assessment of the lesion. IVUS makes use of the \nminimum lumen area (MLA) as the marker for significance of coronary \nstenosis. Overall, IVUS studies showed a relatively high negative predictive \nvalue but a low positive predictive value for ischemia.190\nBoth IVUS and OCT should not be performed to determine the functional significance of a coronary lesion before intervention.\n191 These are useful in \noptimizing stent deployment and determining the size of the vessel                   undergoing stent implantation.\n7.6  Guidelines for referral to a tertiary cardiac center\nFollowing risk stratification:\nLow risk individuals  should be managed with risk factor reduction and/or \nanti anginal medications as necessary. No further intervention is required. \nIntermediate risk individuals  may be managed with risk reduction \nstrategies +/- anti anginal therapy or considered for invasive coronary \nangiogram and revascularization depending on the clinical condition and \npatient preferences."

The diagnostic \nperformance of these modalities is almost similar and the preference to use one \nimaging modality or the other depends on local expertise and availability.3,81\nThe choice of stress imaging technique will depend on:\n  the patient - ability to exercise, obesity, lung problems which may affect image  \n  quality. \n  local resources and expertise.\nPrior to performing the test, the following should be considered:\n  the modality is performed and interpreted by adequately trained personnel.\n  each modality of testing has its own inherent risk e.g. radiation, contrast  \n  sensitivity, bodily injury and interpretation error which should be explained to  \n  the patient.   \nCTA should not be used as a screening test for CAD in the asymptomatic \nindividual. \nDue to the low prevalence of disease in most individuals undergoing health \nscreening, there tends to be too many false-positive lesions. Also, many minor lesions not causing ischemia may be found, potentially resulting in \nunnecessary downstream invasive procedures and intervention.\n6.3.3  Diagnostic Accuracy of Invasive Coronary Angiography (ICA)\nInvasive Coronary angiography has been the “gold standard” for the                 \ndiagnosis of CAD. It can detect obstructive lesions with negative remodelling \naccurately but unlike CTA, it may not be able to detect non-obstructive \nlesions with positive remodelling where the lumen diameter may be \nmaintained.\nICA is rarely necessary in stable patients with suspected CAD for the sole \npurpose of establishing the diagnosis of CAD. It is indicated, following       \nnon-invasive risk stratification, to determine the most appropriate mode of \nrevascularization. \n7.  RISK STRATIFICATION IN STABLE CAD\nThe objectives of risk stratification in stable CAD are for: \n prognosis choosing the appropriate management strategy (e.g. revascularisation in high risk  \n groups)\nAbsolute levels of what constitutes high risk and low risk are not clearly defined for \nthose with stable CAD. There are several risk assessment scores for individuals with stable CAD using different CV end points.\n1,2,64,125-128\nThe ESC guidelines define risk as:44\n high risk - annual mortality of >3%\n intermediate risk - annual mortality of 1-3%\n low risk - annual mortality of <1%Patients with stable CAD should be risk stratified using the following parameters:\n clinical evaluation \n resting ECG \n assessment of left ventricular function\n non-invasive assessment of myocardial ischemia\n where indicated, evaluation of coronary anatomy and physiological  \n assessment of the significance of the coronary lesion\n7.1 Risk Stratification of Stable CAD by Clinical Evaluation\nImportant predictors of adverse outcomes in patients with stable CAD \nare:28,63,129–142\n  increasing age  prior MI  symptoms and signs of CHF\n  pattern of occurrence of angina (recent onset or progressive)\n  severity of angina, particularly if unresponsive to therapy\n  presence of atherosclerotic disease in other vascular beds - peripheral  \n  vessels, cerebral and/or aorta  presence of CV risk factors:\n    Diabetes\n    Hypertension\n    Metabolic syndrome\n    Current smoking\n    Dyslipidaemia\n    Family history of premature CAD\n  co-existing medical conditions:\n    Diabetes \n   Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)\n  psychosocial factors \n    Depression\n    Poor social support\nThe above adverse clinical predictors especially the severity of angina help \nmodulate decisions made based on non-invasive tests of ischemia and \nwhere indicated, physiological testing by Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR).In the diagnosis of CAD, these modalities are used in individuals who have \nintermediate PTP of CAD and who:\n  are unable to exercise adequately or\n  have exercise stress ECG with equivocal results or abnormal at moderate  \n  to high workloads, or \n  have un-interpretable ECG that makes interpretation of exercise stress  \n  ECG test difficult. \nIn the presence of LBBB and ventricular paced rhythms, stress imaging \ntechniques are the non-invasive tests of choice although the diagnostic \naccuracy in these situations, is reduced.\n82 \nIn patients with multivessel disease, imaging tests especially Stress MPI can sometimes underestimate the amount of myocardial ischemia. This is because these tests are based on the principle of perfusion differences \nbetween different myocardial territories and therefore require at least one \nnon-ischemic myocardial territory as a “normal” reference to be able to detect \ninducible myocardial ischemia in another territory. If all 3 vessels are                 \nsignificantly narrowed or there is a combination of left main and multivessel CAD, uniform tracer uptake due to “balanced” ischemia may lead to a rather \nhomogeneous tracer uptake and result in a false negative result.\n83-85\n6.2.2.1  Diagnostic Accuracy of Stress echocardiogram - exercise or  \n    pharmacological stress (dobutamine)\nThis is one of the least expensive and most widely available stress imaging \ntechniques.\nAn exercise stress echocardiogram is more physiological than pharmacological \nstress and is the stress of choice wherever possible.86,87\nPharmacological stress is preferred if the patient is unable to exercise or if \nthere are wall motion abnormalities seen at rest. The pharmacological stressor \nmost often used is dobutamine. The increase in cardiac workload seen with \ndobutamine is less than that with exercise. The addition of atropine augments \nthe sensitivity of the dobutamine stress echocardiogram (DSE).86,88 With the \nuse of dobutamine, viability can also be assessed.89\nThe marker for ischemia in stress echocardiogram is absence of wall thickening and inducible new or worsening wall motion abnormalities before, during and after the stress.\n86,87 If severe, there is also a decrease in LV ejection fraction and LV \nenlargement on stress.86,87 The presence of inducible wall motion abnormalities \nimplies significant limitation of blood flow at peak stress, and usually corresponds to a functionally significant stenosis, although the anatomic severity and physiologic \nconsequences are poorly related.\n86\nDSE has good sensitivity and specificity especially in the setting of multivessel \ndisease and previous MI.81,87,90-92 The interpretation is dependent on the adequacy of \nstress. In the diagnosis of CAD, the sensitivity of DSE is reduced in the presence of \nsingle vessel disease, small vessels and distal disease.86 It has greater use in \nprognostication of CAD and for the prediction of myocardial viability.86,87,91,93\nDSE has also a long learning curve and is relatively subjective relying on the human eye for the accurate assessment of myocardial motion. With the usage of myocardial contrast agents or microbubbles, endocardial border delineation is enhanced, and \nimage quality and diagnostic accuracy improved.\n94-96\n6.2.2.2.   Diagnostic Accuracy of Myocardial Perfusion Imaging (MPI) via  \n     SPECT \nMPI most commonly uses technetium-99m sestamibi as the radiotracer and SPECT \nfor imaging. Stress can be either by exercise or pharmacological agents -                    \nadenosine, dipyridamole or dobutamine.\nIschemia is indicated by reduced radiotracer uptake during stress when compared \nwith the uptake at rest. Transient ischaemic dilatation and reduced post-stress LV \nejection fraction are important predictors of severe CAD.\nSPECT detects a relative reduction in myocardial blood volume that occurs earlier \nthan wall thickening abnormality in the ischaemic cascade. Despite this, SPECT has \nnot been shown to be significantly superior to stress echocardiography in terms of \nsensitivity and detecting the extent of CAD.97 This is due to the poorer spatial         \nresolution of SPECT (12mm) as compared to stress echocardiography (2mm).91\nIn the diagnosis of CAD, MPI with SPECT has good sensitivity and specificity.98 The \ndiagnostic image quality is affected in obese patients, as well as in women with large \nbreasts. The diagnostic accuracy is also reduced in the presence of LBBB and \nventricular pacing.82,99 Other disadvantages are the use of ionizing radiation and its \ncost.6.2.2.3  Diagnostic Accuracy of Stress Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR)\nStress CMR with the use of dobutamine can be used to look at regional wall motion \nabnormalities similar to DSE and with a similar safety profile.100-102 In studies on \npatients with high disease prevalence, stress CMR demonstrated overall good sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of CAD.\n103-105 It is particularly useful in \npatients where it is difficult to acquire good echocardiographic images due to poor \nacoustic windows. \nPerfusion CMR (with adenosine) also has good diagnostic accuracy as compared to \nMPI (nuclear studies).101,105-107 It has also demonstrated good correlation with \nPressure wire (Fractional Flow Reserve) measurements.108\n6.3.  Anatomical testing in the Diagnosis of CAD\n6.3.1  Coronary Calcium Score (CAC)\nCalcium accumulates in coronary arteries in an age-related manner. Thus, all scores \nmust be adjusted for age, as well as for sex.109 The relationship of arterial calcification, \nlike that of angiographic coronary artery stenosis, to the probability of plaque rupture is unknown. Vulnerable plaques are frequently present in the absence of calcification.\n109\nCoronary calcium score has been used to detect CAD. Most studies demonstrated a high sensitivity but a much lower specificity, and an overall predictive accuracy of ≈70% in typical CAD patient populations.\n109 CAC was found not to be superior to other \nnon-invasive diagnostic modalities for the detection of CAD.109 In general, a negative \ntest (CAC =0):109\n  makes the presence of atherosclerotic plaques, including unstable plaques,  \n  very unlikely.  is highly unlikely in the presence of significant luminal obstructive disease.\n  occurs in most patients who have angiographically normal coronary arteries.\nCAC score is more useful in CV risk assessment. (Section 7.5.1, pg 56) \nIn the emergency room, CAC may be used in the triage of patients with a negative \nresting ECG and normal cardiac biomarkers. A CAC=0 has a high sensitivity and a \nvery high negative predictive value for CAD.\n110,1116.3.2  Diagnostic Accuracy of Computed Tomography Angiography  \n   (CTA)\nCTA allows visualization of the coronary arteries non-invasively. It can also \ndetermine the extent of coronary calcification, degree of luminal stenosis, degree of luminal remodelling and plaque characteristics. \nIt is usually done as a 2-stage procedure. The first being the quantification of \ncoronary calcium (CAC) and the second is the CTA. The 64-slice detector is \nthe minimum machine requirement. It has a negative predictive value of 93-99% and sensitivity and specificity of 90-94% and 95-97%                                respectively.\n112-120 It is most useful in the diagnostic assessment of individuals \nwith low or intermediate PTP of CAD.112–115\nCareful patient selection and preparation is integral to obtaining good images. These include:  patients with adequate breath holding capabilities.\n  absence of severe obesity.\n • a favourable calcium score (<400 Agatston score) and distribution.   presence of sinus rhythm (absence of ectopics).  heart rate of less than 65 beats per minute.\nA high coronary calcium score reduces the accuracy of the test.\n112 However, \nper-segment calcification (circumferential extent of calcium - arc calcium) has \na stronger influence on diagnostic accuracy than the total calcium score.121 \nCoronary CTA interpretation is less reliable in the presence of coronary stents of <3mm.\n122 In situations where the clinical presentation suggests \nlow-to-intermediate probability for restenosis and in the presence of larger stents, coronary CTA may be a reasonable alternative to invasive                      \nangiography to rule out significant in-stent restenosis.\n123\nIt is highly accurate in the assessment of coronary artery bypass grafts.124 \nThe interpretation of native coronary vessels in post bypass patients is \nhowever, more difficult.124\nCTA may be considered in:\n  individuals with low to intermediate PTP of CAD and who have mild or  \n  equivocal changes of ischemia in the exercise stress test or stress  \n  imaging tests and who are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic with  \n  good exercise capacity.112–115\n7.2 Risk Stratification of Stable CAD by Resting ECG\nResting ECG abnormalities can predict patients at greater risk of future CV \nevents than those with a normal ECG. These abnormalities \ninclude:63,127,133,135,143-145\n evidence of prior MI\n LBBB\n left anterior hemiblock, \n Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH)\n second or third-degree AV block atrial fibrillation (AF)\n7.3 Risk Stratification of Stable CAD by Left Ventricular Function\nLV function is the strongest predictor of survival. Patients with an LVEF of \n<50 % are already at high risk of CV death (annual mortality rate of >3%) \nwithout incorporating other risk factors.\n45,46,133,134,146,147\nIn the presence of a depressed LV function, it is important to determine if this is due to infarcted (scar) tissue or viable but stunned ischemic myocardium. \nThis can be done by stress imaging techniques. In the presence of ischemic \nbut viable myocardium, coronary revascularisation can result in an                    \nimprovement in LV function and survival.\n148\n7.4 Risk Stratification of Stable CAD by Non-invasive Testing \nNon-invasive tests provide useful information for prognostication. (Table 2, \npg 24) A negative test carries a good prognosis but the clinical evaluation \n(e.g. age, ability to exercise, exercise duration, co-morbidity such as \ndiabetes, CKD etc) and LV function should also be considered when              \nassessing CV risk. \nSmall imaging sub studies have shown mixed results when looking at CV \noutcomes in individuals with moderate to severe ischemia treated with \nrevascularization as compared to OMT.149–152 Two large clinical trials have not \nshown any advantage of revascularization as compared to OMT in these patients.\n76,153 In individuals with depressed LV function (LVEF ≤35%) CABG \ndid not reduce all-cause mortality but resulted in a reduction in CV mortality and hospitalizations.\n154 The ISCHEMIA trial is a large randomized clinical trial I, B\nI, B\nI, C\nI, C\nIIa, C\nthat is currently underway specifically addressing the role of revascularisation versus OMT in patients with moderate to severe myocardial ischemia.\n155 \nIn patients with unprotected Left Main stem stenosis of > 50%, revascularisation \nby CABG has been shown to improve survival in the pivotal Coronary Artery \nSurgery Study (CASS) Registry.156  In view of this “the benefit of surgery over \nmedical treatment in patients with significant LMS stenosis (greater than 50%) is little argued.” \n157\n7.5.

The diagnostic \nperformance of these modalities is almost similar and the preference to use one \nimaging modality or the other depends on local expertise and availability.3,81\nThe choice of stress imaging technique will depend on:\n  the patient - ability to exercise, obesity, lung problems which may affect image  \n  quality. \n  local resources and expertise.\nPrior to performing the test, the following should be considered:\n  the modality is performed and interpreted by adequately trained personnel.\n  each modality of testing has its own inherent risk e.g. radiation, contrast  \n  sensitivity, bodily injury and interpretation error which should be explained to  \n  the patient.   \nCTA should not be used as a screening test for CAD in the asymptomatic \nindividual. \nDue to the low prevalence of disease in most individuals undergoing health \nscreening, there tends to be too many false-positive lesions. Also, many minor lesions not causing ischemia may be found, potentially resulting in \nunnecessary downstream invasive procedures and intervention.\n6.3.3  Diagnostic Accuracy of Invasive Coronary Angiography (ICA)\nInvasive Coronary angiography has been the “gold standard” for the                 \ndiagnosis of CAD. It can detect obstructive lesions with negative remodelling \naccurately but unlike CTA, it may not be able to detect non-obstructive \nlesions with positive remodelling where the lumen diameter may be \nmaintained.\nICA is rarely necessary in stable patients with suspected CAD for the sole \npurpose of establishing the diagnosis of CAD. It is indicated, following       \nnon-invasive risk stratification, to determine the most appropriate mode of \nrevascularization. \n7.  RISK STRATIFICATION IN STABLE CAD\nThe objectives of risk stratification in stable CAD are for: \n prognosis choosing the appropriate management strategy (e.g. revascularisation in high risk  \n groups)\nAbsolute levels of what constitutes high risk and low risk are not clearly defined for \nthose with stable CAD. There are several risk assessment scores for individuals with stable CAD using different CV end points.\n1,2,64,125-128\nThe ESC guidelines define risk as:44\n high risk - annual mortality of >3%\n intermediate risk - annual mortality of 1-3%\n low risk - annual mortality of <1%Patients with stable CAD should be risk stratified using the following parameters:\n clinical evaluation \n resting ECG \n assessment of left ventricular function\n non-invasive assessment of myocardial ischemia\n where indicated, evaluation of coronary anatomy and physiological  \n assessment of the significance of the coronary lesion\n7.1 Risk Stratification of Stable CAD by Clinical Evaluation\nImportant predictors of adverse outcomes in patients with stable CAD \nare:28,63,129–142\n  increasing age  prior MI  symptoms and signs of CHF\n  pattern of occurrence of angina (recent onset or progressive)\n  severity of angina, particularly if unresponsive to therapy\n  presence of atherosclerotic disease in other vascular beds - peripheral  \n  vessels, cerebral and/or aorta  presence of CV risk factors:\n    Diabetes\n    Hypertension\n    Metabolic syndrome\n    Current smoking\n    Dyslipidaemia\n    Family history of premature CAD\n  co-existing medical conditions:\n    Diabetes \n   Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)\n  psychosocial factors \n    Depression\n    Poor social support\nThe above adverse clinical predictors especially the severity of angina help \nmodulate decisions made based on non-invasive tests of ischemia and \nwhere indicated, physiological testing by Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR).In the diagnosis of CAD, these modalities are used in individuals who have \nintermediate PTP of CAD and who:\n  are unable to exercise adequately or\n  have exercise stress ECG with equivocal results or abnormal at moderate  \n  to high workloads, or \n  have un-interpretable ECG that makes interpretation of exercise stress  \n  ECG test difficult. \nIn the presence of LBBB and ventricular paced rhythms, stress imaging \ntechniques are the non-invasive tests of choice although the diagnostic \naccuracy in these situations, is reduced.\n82 \nIn patients with multivessel disease, imaging tests especially Stress MPI can sometimes underestimate the amount of myocardial ischemia. This is because these tests are based on the principle of perfusion differences \nbetween different myocardial territories and therefore require at least one \nnon-ischemic myocardial territory as a “normal” reference to be able to detect \ninducible myocardial ischemia in another territory. If all 3 vessels are                 \nsignificantly narrowed or there is a combination of left main and multivessel CAD, uniform tracer uptake due to “balanced” ischemia may lead to a rather \nhomogeneous tracer uptake and result in a false negative result.\n83-85\n6.2.2.1  Diagnostic Accuracy of Stress echocardiogram - exercise or  \n    pharmacological stress (dobutamine)\nThis is one of the least expensive and most widely available stress imaging \ntechniques.\nAn exercise stress echocardiogram is more physiological than pharmacological \nstress and is the stress of choice wherever possible.86,87\nPharmacological stress is preferred if the patient is unable to exercise or if \nthere are wall motion abnormalities seen at rest. The pharmacological stressor \nmost often used is dobutamine. The increase in cardiac workload seen with \ndobutamine is less than that with exercise. The addition of atropine augments \nthe sensitivity of the dobutamine stress echocardiogram (DSE).86,88 With the \nuse of dobutamine, viability can also be assessed.89\nThe marker for ischemia in stress echocardiogram is absence of wall thickening and inducible new or worsening wall motion abnormalities before, during and after the stress.\n86,87 If severe, there is also a decrease in LV ejection fraction and LV \nenlargement on stress.86,87 The presence of inducible wall motion abnormalities \nimplies significant limitation of blood flow at peak stress, and usually corresponds to a functionally significant stenosis, although the anatomic severity and physiologic \nconsequences are poorly related.\n86\nDSE has good sensitivity and specificity especially in the setting of multivessel \ndisease and previous MI.81,87,90-92 The interpretation is dependent on the adequacy of \nstress. In the diagnosis of CAD, the sensitivity of DSE is reduced in the presence of \nsingle vessel disease, small vessels and distal disease.86 It has greater use in \nprognostication of CAD and for the prediction of myocardial viability.86,87,91,93\nDSE has also a long learning curve and is relatively subjective relying on the human eye for the accurate assessment of myocardial motion. With the usage of myocardial contrast agents or microbubbles, endocardial border delineation is enhanced, and \nimage quality and diagnostic accuracy improved.\n94-96\n6.2.2.2.   Diagnostic Accuracy of Myocardial Perfusion Imaging (MPI) via  \n     SPECT \nMPI most commonly uses technetium-99m sestamibi as the radiotracer and SPECT \nfor imaging. Stress can be either by exercise or pharmacological agents -                    \nadenosine, dipyridamole or dobutamine.\nIschemia is indicated by reduced radiotracer uptake during stress when compared \nwith the uptake at rest. Transient ischaemic dilatation and reduced post-stress LV \nejection fraction are important predictors of severe CAD.\nSPECT detects a relative reduction in myocardial blood volume that occurs earlier \nthan wall thickening abnormality in the ischaemic cascade. Despite this, SPECT has \nnot been shown to be significantly superior to stress echocardiography in terms of \nsensitivity and detecting the extent of CAD.97 This is due to the poorer spatial         \nresolution of SPECT (12mm) as compared to stress echocardiography (2mm).91\nIn the diagnosis of CAD, MPI with SPECT has good sensitivity and specificity.98 The \ndiagnostic image quality is affected in obese patients, as well as in women with large \nbreasts. The diagnostic accuracy is also reduced in the presence of LBBB and \nventricular pacing.82,99 Other disadvantages are the use of ionizing radiation and its \ncost.6.2.2.3  Diagnostic Accuracy of Stress Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR)\nStress CMR with the use of dobutamine can be used to look at regional wall motion \nabnormalities similar to DSE and with a similar safety profile.100-102 In studies on \npatients with high disease prevalence, stress CMR demonstrated overall good sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of CAD.\n103-105 It is particularly useful in \npatients where it is difficult to acquire good echocardiographic images due to poor \nacoustic windows. \nPerfusion CMR (with adenosine) also has good diagnostic accuracy as compared to \nMPI (nuclear studies).101,105-107 It has also demonstrated good correlation with \nPressure wire (Fractional Flow Reserve) measurements.108\n6.3.  Anatomical testing in the Diagnosis of CAD\n6.3.1  Coronary Calcium Score (CAC)\nCalcium accumulates in coronary arteries in an age-related manner. Thus, all scores \nmust be adjusted for age, as well as for sex.109 The relationship of arterial calcification, \nlike that of angiographic coronary artery stenosis, to the probability of plaque rupture is unknown. Vulnerable plaques are frequently present in the absence of calcification.\n109\nCoronary calcium score has been used to detect CAD. Most studies demonstrated a high sensitivity but a much lower specificity, and an overall predictive accuracy of ≈70% in typical CAD patient populations.\n109 CAC was found not to be superior to other \nnon-invasive diagnostic modalities for the detection of CAD.109 In general, a negative \ntest (CAC =0):109\n  makes the presence of atherosclerotic plaques, including unstable plaques,  \n  very unlikely.  is highly unlikely in the presence of significant luminal obstructive disease.\n  occurs in most patients who have angiographically normal coronary arteries.\nCAC score is more useful in CV risk assessment. (Section 7.5.1, pg 56) \nIn the emergency room, CAC may be used in the triage of patients with a negative \nresting ECG and normal cardiac biomarkers. A CAC=0 has a high sensitivity and a \nvery high negative predictive value for CAD.\n110,1116.3.2  Diagnostic Accuracy of Computed Tomography Angiography  \n   (CTA)\nCTA allows visualization of the coronary arteries non-invasively. It can also \ndetermine the extent of coronary calcification, degree of luminal stenosis, degree of luminal remodelling and plaque characteristics. \nIt is usually done as a 2-stage procedure. The first being the quantification of \ncoronary calcium (CAC) and the second is the CTA. The 64-slice detector is \nthe minimum machine requirement. It has a negative predictive value of 93-99% and sensitivity and specificity of 90-94% and 95-97%                                respectively.\n112-120 It is most useful in the diagnostic assessment of individuals \nwith low or intermediate PTP of CAD.112–115\nCareful patient selection and preparation is integral to obtaining good images. These include:  patients with adequate breath holding capabilities.\n  absence of severe obesity.\n • a favourable calcium score (<400 Agatston score) and distribution.   presence of sinus rhythm (absence of ectopics).  heart rate of less than 65 beats per minute.\nA high coronary calcium score reduces the accuracy of the test.\n112 However, \nper-segment calcification (circumferential extent of calcium - arc calcium) has \na stronger influence on diagnostic accuracy than the total calcium score.121 \nCoronary CTA interpretation is less reliable in the presence of coronary stents of <3mm.\n122 In situations where the clinical presentation suggests \nlow-to-intermediate probability for restenosis and in the presence of larger stents, coronary CTA may be a reasonable alternative to invasive                      \nangiography to rule out significant in-stent restenosis.\n123\nIt is highly accurate in the assessment of coronary artery bypass grafts.124 \nThe interpretation of native coronary vessels in post bypass patients is \nhowever, more difficult.124\nCTA may be considered in:\n  individuals with low to intermediate PTP of CAD and who have mild or  \n  equivocal changes of ischemia in the exercise stress test or stress  \n  imaging tests and who are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic with  \n  good exercise capacity.112–115\n7.2 Risk Stratification of Stable CAD by Resting ECG\nResting ECG abnormalities can predict patients at greater risk of future CV \nevents than those with a normal ECG. These abnormalities \ninclude:63,127,133,135,143-145\n evidence of prior MI\n LBBB\n left anterior hemiblock, \n Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH)\n second or third-degree AV block atrial fibrillation (AF)\n7.3 Risk Stratification of Stable CAD by Left Ventricular Function\nLV function is the strongest predictor of survival. Patients with an LVEF of \n<50 % are already at high risk of CV death (annual mortality rate of >3%) \nwithout incorporating other risk factors.\n45,46,133,134,146,147\nIn the presence of a depressed LV function, it is important to determine if this is due to infarcted (scar) tissue or viable but stunned ischemic myocardium. \nThis can be done by stress imaging techniques. In the presence of ischemic \nbut viable myocardium, coronary revascularisation can result in an                    \nimprovement in LV function and survival.\n148\n7.4 Risk Stratification of Stable CAD by Non-invasive Testing \nNon-invasive tests provide useful information for prognostication. (Table 2, \npg 24) A negative test carries a good prognosis but the clinical evaluation \n(e.g. age, ability to exercise, exercise duration, co-morbidity such as \ndiabetes, CKD etc) and LV function should also be considered when              \nassessing CV risk. \nSmall imaging sub studies have shown mixed results when looking at CV \noutcomes in individuals with moderate to severe ischemia treated with \nrevascularization as compared to OMT.149–152 Two large clinical trials have not \nshown any advantage of revascularization as compared to OMT in these patients.\n76,153 In individuals with depressed LV function (LVEF ≤35%) CABG \ndid not reduce all-cause mortality but resulted in a reduction in CV mortality and hospitalizations.\n154 The ISCHEMIA trial is a large randomized clinical trial \nthat is currently underway specifically addressing the role of revascularisation \nversus OMT in patients with moderate to severe myocardial ischemia.155 \nIn patients with unprotected Left Main stem stenosis of > 50%, revascularisation \nby CABG has been shown to improve survival in the pivotal Coronary Artery \nSurgery Study (CASS) Registry.156  In view of this “the benefit of surgery over \nmedical treatment in patients with significant LMS stenosis (greater than 50%) is little argued.” \n157\n7.5.  Risk Stratification of Stable CAD by Anatomic testing\n \n7.5.1  Coronary Calcium (CAC) Score \nCAC scores help with CV risk stratification.158-163 (Table 8, pg 57) It guides risk \nreduction strategy, OMT and the need for further evaluation. \nCAC score alone was able to predict CHD risk independently of the           \nFramingham Risk Score.156,157 When used together with the traditional CV risk \nfactors, it had incremental value in CV risk prediction.164,165 There is a                \nsignificant correlation between CAC score and overall coronary artery         \natherosclerotic plaque, with a high sensitivity >95% and a high negative \npredictive value of >95%.109,166,167 The CAC score was found to be highly \npredictive of CV risk in 4 ethnic groups - white, black, Hispanic, and \nChinese.168 \nPersons both asymptomatic and symptomatic, with a calcium score =0 have \na low CV event rate and an excellent long-term survival.167,169 However the \nPTP of disease and the clinical setting should be considered when                     \ninterpreting the test result. In interpreting a CAC =0:170\n if the PTP of CAD is low (e.g. asymptomatic individuals), there is low risk  \n of CAD and a low risk of near-term coronary events. \n in older asymptomatic patients with risk factors, there is a moderate   \n increased risk of CV events.\n in persons with clinical signs and symptoms associated with an intermediate  \n to high risk of CAD, there is often associated myocardial ischemia on  \n provocative testing and a high risk of near-term coronary events.171IIa, B7.5.3  Risk Stratification by Invasive Coronary Angiography (ICA)  \nICA continues to be the “gold standard” in assessing coronary anatomy \nalthough it has its limitations. It cannot detect vulnerable plaques which are in \nmost cases not severe (<50% stenosis) but have a rich lipid core. \nDespite these limitations, the extent and site of coronary lesions provide good \nprognostic indicators. The prognosis is worse if: \n46,146,147\n  the greater the number of vessels involved. • there is left main stem stenosis of >50%.  the proximal LAD is involved.\nRecent large clinical trials did not however, show any improvement in clinical \noutcomes in patients with significant stable CAD when an initial strategy of \ncoronary revascularization was compared to intensive OMT.\n76,153,154\nIn patients who have unprotected left main stem stenosis, CABG has been shown to improve survival when compared to medical therapy in the large \nCASS registry.\n156 Although this trial was performed before the era of current \nintensive OMT, it is considered unethical to repeat it. \nCoronary arteriography should NOT be performed in patients: \n with angina who refuse invasive diagnostic procedures.\n• who prefer to avoid coronary revascularization either by PCI or CABG.\n who are not candidates for PCI or CABG. in whom PCI/CABG will not improve quality-of-life.\n7.5.4  Risk assessment by Physiological Assessment of the functional  \n   severity of coronary lesions \nCoronary angiography is of limited value in defining the functional                   \nsignificance of coronary stenosis. Yet the most important factor related to \noutcome is the presence and extent of inducible ischemia.\n177 If a stenosis is \nnot flow-limiting, it will not cause angina and the prognosis without coronary \nintervention is excellent, with a ‘hard’ event rate (cardiac death or non-fatal \nMI) of <1% per year.175 This event rate was not reduced with PCI and \nstenting.1757.5.4.1 Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR) \nThe functional severity of coronary lesions visualized angiographically may \nbe assessed invasively, by measuring the intracoronary artery pressure or \nFractional Flow Reserve (FFR).

The diagnostic \nperformance of these modalities is almost similar and the preference to use one \nimaging modality or the other depends on local expertise and availability.3,81\nThe choice of stress imaging technique will depend on:\n  the patient - ability to exercise, obesity, lung problems which may affect image  \n  quality. \n  local resources and expertise.\nPrior to performing the test, the following should be considered:\n  the modality is performed and interpreted by adequately trained personnel.\n  each modality of testing has its own inherent risk e.g. radiation, contrast  \n  sensitivity, bodily injury and interpretation error which should be explained to  \n  the patient.   \nCTA should not be used as a screening test for CAD in the asymptomatic \nindividual. \nDue to the low prevalence of disease in most individuals undergoing health \nscreening, there tends to be too many false-positive lesions. Also, many minor lesions not causing ischemia may be found, potentially resulting in \nunnecessary downstream invasive procedures and intervention.\n6.3.3  Diagnostic Accuracy of Invasive Coronary Angiography (ICA)\nInvasive Coronary angiography has been the “gold standard” for the                 \ndiagnosis of CAD. It can detect obstructive lesions with negative remodelling \naccurately but unlike CTA, it may not be able to detect non-obstructive \nlesions with positive remodelling where the lumen diameter may be \nmaintained.\nICA is rarely necessary in stable patients with suspected CAD for the sole \npurpose of establishing the diagnosis of CAD. It is indicated, following       \nnon-invasive risk stratification, to determine the most appropriate mode of \nrevascularization. \n7.  RISK STRATIFICATION IN STABLE CAD\nThe objectives of risk stratification in stable CAD are for: \n prognosis choosing the appropriate management strategy (e.g. revascularisation in high risk  \n groups)\nAbsolute levels of what constitutes high risk and low risk are not clearly defined for \nthose with stable CAD. There are several risk assessment scores for individuals with stable CAD using different CV end points.\n1,2,64,125-128\nThe ESC guidelines define risk as:44\n high risk - annual mortality of >3%\n intermediate risk - annual mortality of 1-3%\n low risk - annual mortality of <1%Patients with stable CAD should be risk stratified using the following parameters:\n clinical evaluation \n resting ECG \n assessment of left ventricular function\n non-invasive assessment of myocardial ischemia\n where indicated, evaluation of coronary anatomy and physiological  \n assessment of the significance of the coronary lesion\n7.1 Risk Stratification of Stable CAD by Clinical Evaluation\nImportant predictors of adverse outcomes in patients with stable CAD \nare:28,63,129–142\n  increasing age  prior MI  symptoms and signs of CHF\n  pattern of occurrence of angina (recent onset or progressive)\n  severity of angina, particularly if unresponsive to therapy\n  presence of atherosclerotic disease in other vascular beds - peripheral  \n  vessels, cerebral and/or aorta  presence of CV risk factors:\n    Diabetes\n    Hypertension\n    Metabolic syndrome\n    Current smoking\n    Dyslipidaemia\n    Family history of premature CAD\n  co-existing medical conditions:\n    Diabetes \n   Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)\n  psychosocial factors \n    Depression\n    Poor social support\nThe above adverse clinical predictors especially the severity of angina help \nmodulate decisions made based on non-invasive tests of ischemia and \nwhere indicated, physiological testing by Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR).In the diagnosis of CAD, these modalities are used in individuals who have \nintermediate PTP of CAD and who:\n  are unable to exercise adequately or\n  have exercise stress ECG with equivocal results or abnormal at moderate  \n  to high workloads, or \n  have un-interpretable ECG that makes interpretation of exercise stress  \n  ECG test difficult. \nIn the presence of LBBB and ventricular paced rhythms, stress imaging \ntechniques are the non-invasive tests of choice although the diagnostic \naccuracy in these situations, is reduced.\n82 \nIn patients with multivessel disease, imaging tests especially Stress MPI can sometimes underestimate the amount of myocardial ischemia. This is because these tests are based on the principle of perfusion differences \nbetween different myocardial territories and therefore require at least one \nnon-ischemic myocardial territory as a “normal” reference to be able to detect \ninducible myocardial ischemia in another territory. If all 3 vessels are                 \nsignificantly narrowed or there is a combination of left main and multivessel CAD, uniform tracer uptake due to “balanced” ischemia may lead to a rather \nhomogeneous tracer uptake and result in a false negative result.\n83-85\n6.2.2.1  Diagnostic Accuracy of Stress echocardiogram - exercise or  \n    pharmacological stress (dobutamine)\nThis is one of the least expensive and most widely available stress imaging \ntechniques.\nAn exercise stress echocardiogram is more physiological than pharmacological \nstress and is the stress of choice wherever possible.86,87\nPharmacological stress is preferred if the patient is unable to exercise or if \nthere are wall motion abnormalities seen at rest. The pharmacological stressor \nmost often used is dobutamine. The increase in cardiac workload seen with \ndobutamine is less than that with exercise. The addition of atropine augments \nthe sensitivity of the dobutamine stress echocardiogram (DSE).86,88 With the \nuse of dobutamine, viability can also be assessed.89\nThe marker for ischemia in stress echocardiogram is absence of wall thickening and inducible new or worsening wall motion abnormalities before, during and after the stress.\n86,87 If severe, there is also a decrease in LV ejection fraction and LV \nenlargement on stress.86,87 The presence of inducible wall motion abnormalities \nimplies significant limitation of blood flow at peak stress, and usually corresponds to a functionally significant stenosis, although the anatomic severity and physiologic \nconsequences are poorly related.\n86\nDSE has good sensitivity and specificity especially in the setting of multivessel \ndisease and previous MI.81,87,90-92 The interpretation is dependent on the adequacy of \nstress. In the diagnosis of CAD, the sensitivity of DSE is reduced in the presence of \nsingle vessel disease, small vessels and distal disease.86 It has greater use in \nprognostication of CAD and for the prediction of myocardial viability.86,87,91,93\nDSE has also a long learning curve and is relatively subjective relying on the human eye for the accurate assessment of myocardial motion. With the usage of myocardial contrast agents or microbubbles, endocardial border delineation is enhanced, and \nimage quality and diagnostic accuracy improved.\n94-96\n6.2.2.2.   Diagnostic Accuracy of Myocardial Perfusion Imaging (MPI) via  \n     SPECT \nMPI most commonly uses technetium-99m sestamibi as the radiotracer and SPECT \nfor imaging. Stress can be either by exercise or pharmacological agents -                    \nadenosine, dipyridamole or dobutamine.\nIschemia is indicated by reduced radiotracer uptake during stress when compared \nwith the uptake at rest. Transient ischaemic dilatation and reduced post-stress LV \nejection fraction are important predictors of severe CAD.\nSPECT detects a relative reduction in myocardial blood volume that occurs earlier \nthan wall thickening abnormality in the ischaemic cascade. Despite this, SPECT has \nnot been shown to be significantly superior to stress echocardiography in terms of \nsensitivity and detecting the extent of CAD.97 This is due to the poorer spatial         \nresolution of SPECT (12mm) as compared to stress echocardiography (2mm).91\nIn the diagnosis of CAD, MPI with SPECT has good sensitivity and specificity.98 The \ndiagnostic image quality is affected in obese patients, as well as in women with large \nbreasts. The diagnostic accuracy is also reduced in the presence of LBBB and \nventricular pacing.82,99 Other disadvantages are the use of ionizing radiation and its \ncost.6.2.2.3  Diagnostic Accuracy of Stress Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR)\nStress CMR with the use of dobutamine can be used to look at regional wall motion \nabnormalities similar to DSE and with a similar safety profile.100-102 In studies on \npatients with high disease prevalence, stress CMR demonstrated overall good sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of CAD.\n103-105 It is particularly useful in \npatients where it is difficult to acquire good echocardiographic images due to poor \nacoustic windows. \nPerfusion CMR (with adenosine) also has good diagnostic accuracy as compared to \nMPI (nuclear studies).101,105-107 It has also demonstrated good correlation with \nPressure wire (Fractional Flow Reserve) measurements.108\n6.3.  Anatomical testing in the Diagnosis of CAD\n6.3.1  Coronary Calcium Score (CAC)\nCalcium accumulates in coronary arteries in an age-related manner. Thus, all scores \nmust be adjusted for age, as well as for sex.109 The relationship of arterial calcification, \nlike that of angiographic coronary artery stenosis, to the probability of plaque rupture is unknown. Vulnerable plaques are frequently present in the absence of calcification.\n109\nCoronary calcium score has been used to detect CAD. Most studies demonstrated a high sensitivity but a much lower specificity, and an overall predictive accuracy of ≈70% in typical CAD patient populations.\n109 CAC was found not to be superior to other \nnon-invasive diagnostic modalities for the detection of CAD.109 In general, a negative \ntest (CAC =0):109\n  makes the presence of atherosclerotic plaques, including unstable plaques,  \n  very unlikely.  is highly unlikely in the presence of significant luminal obstructive disease.\n  occurs in most patients who have angiographically normal coronary arteries.\nCAC score is more useful in CV risk assessment. (Section 7.5.1, pg 56) \nIn the emergency room, CAC may be used in the triage of patients with a negative \nresting ECG and normal cardiac biomarkers. A CAC=0 has a high sensitivity and a \nvery high negative predictive value for CAD.\n110,1116.3.2  Diagnostic Accuracy of Computed Tomography Angiography  \n   (CTA)\nCTA allows visualization of the coronary arteries non-invasively. It can also \ndetermine the extent of coronary calcification, degree of luminal stenosis, degree of luminal remodelling and plaque characteristics. \nIt is usually done as a 2-stage procedure. The first being the quantification of \ncoronary calcium (CAC) and the second is the CTA. The 64-slice detector is \nthe minimum machine requirement. It has a negative predictive value of 93-99% and sensitivity and specificity of 90-94% and 95-97%                                respectively.\n112-120 It is most useful in the diagnostic assessment of individuals \nwith low or intermediate PTP of CAD.112–115\nCareful patient selection and preparation is integral to obtaining good images. These include:  patients with adequate breath holding capabilities.\n  absence of severe obesity.\n • a favourable calcium score (<400 Agatston score) and distribution.   presence of sinus rhythm (absence of ectopics).  heart rate of less than 65 beats per minute.\nA high coronary calcium score reduces the accuracy of the test.\n112 However, \nper-segment calcification (circumferential extent of calcium - arc calcium) has \na stronger influence on diagnostic accuracy than the total calcium score.121 \nCoronary CTA interpretation is less reliable in the presence of coronary stents of <3mm.\n122 In situations where the clinical presentation suggests \nlow-to-intermediate probability for restenosis and in the presence of larger stents, coronary CTA may be a reasonable alternative to invasive                      \nangiography to rule out significant in-stent restenosis.\n123\nIt is highly accurate in the assessment of coronary artery bypass grafts.124 \nThe interpretation of native coronary vessels in post bypass patients is \nhowever, more difficult.124\nCTA may be considered in:\n  individuals with low to intermediate PTP of CAD and who have mild or  \n  equivocal changes of ischemia in the exercise stress test or stress  \n  imaging tests and who are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic with  \n  good exercise capacity.112–115\n7.2 Risk Stratification of Stable CAD by Resting ECG\nResting ECG abnormalities can predict patients at greater risk of future CV \nevents than those with a normal ECG. These abnormalities \ninclude:63,127,133,135,143-145\n evidence of prior MI\n LBBB\n left anterior hemiblock, \n Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH)\n second or third-degree AV block atrial fibrillation (AF)\n7.3 Risk Stratification of Stable CAD by Left Ventricular Function\nLV function is the strongest predictor of survival. Patients with an LVEF of \n<50 % are already at high risk of CV death (annual mortality rate of >3%) \nwithout incorporating other risk factors.\n45,46,133,134,146,147\nIn the presence of a depressed LV function, it is important to determine if this is due to infarcted (scar) tissue or viable but stunned ischemic myocardium. \nThis can be done by stress imaging techniques. In the presence of ischemic \nbut viable myocardium, coronary revascularisation can result in an                    \nimprovement in LV function and survival.\n148\n7.4 Risk Stratification of Stable CAD by Non-invasive Testing \nNon-invasive tests provide useful information for prognostication. (Table 2, \npg 24) A negative test carries a good prognosis but the clinical evaluation \n(e.g. age, ability to exercise, exercise duration, co-morbidity such as \ndiabetes, CKD etc) and LV function should also be considered when              \nassessing CV risk. \nSmall imaging sub studies have shown mixed results when looking at CV \noutcomes in individuals with moderate to severe ischemia treated with \nrevascularization as compared to OMT.149–152 Two large clinical trials have not \nshown any advantage of revascularization as compared to OMT in these patients.\n76,153 In individuals with depressed LV function (LVEF ≤35%) CABG \ndid not reduce all-cause mortality but resulted in a reduction in CV mortality and hospitalizations.\n154 The ISCHEMIA trial is a large randomized clinical trial \nthat is currently underway specifically addressing the role of revascularisation \nversus OMT in patients with moderate to severe myocardial ischemia.155 \nIn patients with unprotected Left Main stem stenosis of > 50%, revascularisation \nby CABG has been shown to improve survival in the pivotal Coronary Artery \nSurgery Study (CASS) Registry.156  In view of this “the benefit of surgery over \nmedical treatment in patients with significant LMS stenosis (greater than 50%) is little argued.” \n157\n7.5.  Risk Stratification of Stable CAD by Anatomic testing\n \n7.5.1  Coronary Calcium (CAC) Score \nCAC scores help with CV risk stratification.158-163 (Table 8, pg 57) It guides risk \nreduction strategy, OMT and the need for further evaluation. CAC score alone was able to predict CHD risk independently of the           \nFramingham Risk Score.\n156,157 When used together with the traditional CV risk \nfactors, it had incremental value in CV risk prediction.164,165 There is a                \nsignificant correlation between CAC score and overall coronary artery         atherosclerotic plaque, with a high sensitivity >95% and a high negative \npredictive value of >95%.\n109,166,167 The CAC score was found to be highly \npredictive of CV risk in 4 ethnic groups - white, black, Hispanic, and \nChinese.168 \nPersons both asymptomatic and symptomatic, with a calcium score =0 have \na low CV event rate and an excellent long-term survival.167,169 However the \nPTP of disease and the clinical setting should be considered when                     \ninterpreting the test result. In interpreting a CAC =0:170\n if the PTP of CAD is low (e.g. asymptomatic individuals), there is low risk  \n of CAD and a low risk of near-term coronary events. \n in older asymptomatic patients with risk factors, there is a moderate   \n increased risk of CV events.\n in persons with clinical signs and symptoms associated with an intermediate  \n to high risk of CAD, there is often associated myocardial ischemia on  \n provocative testing and a high risk of near-term coronary events.171IIa, A\nI, A7.5.3  Risk Stratification by Invasive Coronary Angiography (ICA)  \nICA continues to be the “gold standard” in assessing coronary anatomy \nalthough it has its limitations. It cannot detect vulnerable plaques which are in \nmost cases not severe (<50% stenosis) but have a rich lipid core. \nDespite these limitations, the extent and site of coronary lesions provide good \nprognostic indicators. The prognosis is worse if: \n46,146,147\n  the greater the number of vessels involved. • there is left main stem stenosis of >50%.  the proximal LAD is involved.\nRecent large clinical trials did not however, show any improvement in clinical \noutcomes in patients with significant stable CAD when an initial strategy of \ncoronary revascularization was compared to intensive OMT.\n76,153,154\nIn patients who have unprotected left main stem stenosis, CABG has been shown to improve survival when compared to medical therapy in the large \nCASS registry.\n156 Although this trial was performed before the era of current \nintensive OMT, it is considered unethical to repeat it. \nCoronary arteriography should NOT be performed in patients: \n with angina who refuse invasive diagnostic procedures.\n• who prefer to avoid coronary revascularization either by PCI or CABG.\n who are not candidates for PCI or CABG. in whom PCI/CABG will not improve quality-of-life.\n7.5.4  Risk assessment by Physiological Assessment of the functional  \n   severity of coronary lesions \nCoronary angiography is of limited value in defining the functional                   \nsignificance of coronary stenosis. Yet the most important factor related to \noutcome is the presence and extent of inducible ischemia.\n177 If a stenosis is \nnot flow-limiting, it will not cause angina and the prognosis without coronary \nintervention is excellent, with a ‘hard’ event rate (cardiac death or non-fatal \nMI) of <1% per year.175 This event rate was not reduced with PCI and \nstenting.1757.5.4.1 Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR) \nThe functional severity of coronary lesions visualized angiographically may \nbe assessed invasively, by measuring the intracoronary artery pressure or \nFractional Flow Reserve (FFR). FFR is more accurate than visual                       assessment of the significance and severity of coronary lesions.\n176 Even in \nthe presence of angiographically insignificant stenosis, lesions with low FFR showed significantly higher event rates than those with high FFR.\n178\nFFR is presently considered as the ‘gold standard’ for invasive assessment of the significance of coronary stenosis and is useful in decision making in the \nneed for coronary revascularization. This: \n84\n  takes into consideration collateral blood flow.  takes into consideration the amount of viable myocardial mass.\n  is independent of haemodynamic variations.\n  has a high reproducibility. \nFFR is indicated for all coronary artery stenosis of 50-90%, including left main \nstenosis, side branch stenosis, tandem lesions and even in the setting of      \nnon-culprit lesions in ACS.\n84,179-181 In patients with multivessel CAD, PCI \nguided by FFR results in an improved outcome irrespective of available \nnon-invasive functional test results.182-184\nFFR is calculated as the ratio of distal coronary pressure to aortic pressure \nmeasured during maximal hyperaemia with either intracoronary or                        intravenous infusion of adenosine. A normal value for FFR is 1.0 regardless \nof the status of the microcirculation. In individuals on OMT with:\n84,179-184\n • FFR >0.80 - have no improved outcomes with revascularisation.\n  FFR between >0.75 but <0.8 - have intermediate benefit with                        \n  revascularisation and management should be based on clinical  \n  judgement.  • FFR <0.75 - benefit from revascularisation. \nUse of FFR accurately identifies which coronary lesions should be                       \nrevascularized and improves outcome. \nIt is recommended that in individuals with stable CAD, FFR be used to guide \nrevascularization of lesions of intermediate severity.\n182-185\nAt present, there are ongoing studies on the use of instantaneous wave-free \nratio (iFR), a pressure-derived index of stenosis severity that is not obtained  Calcium score  HR for incident   CV Risk   \n  MI and CHD mortality (Risk of death at 10 years) \n0-100  1.0  Mild            \n101-400  2.4  Moderate    \n401-1000 5.1  High\n>1000  7.6  Very High\n*Based on a prospective study of subjects ≥55 years of age that began in 1990, mean age 71 years and \nadjusted for age, sex, body mass index, hypertension, total cholesterol, HDL-Cholesterol, smoking, diabetes \nand a family history of MI.\n#Vliegenthart R, Oudkerk M, Hofman A, Oei HH, van Dijck W, van Rooij FJ, Witteman JC.

It is indicated, following       \nnon-invasive risk stratification, to determine the most appropriate mode of \nrevascularization. \n7.  RISK STRATIFICATION IN STABLE CAD\nThe objectives of risk stratification in stable CAD are for: \n prognosis choosing the appropriate management strategy (e.g. revascularisation in high risk  \n groups)\nAbsolute levels of what constitutes high risk and low risk are not clearly defined for \nthose with stable CAD. There are several risk assessment scores for individuals with stable CAD using different CV end points.\n1,2,64,125-128\nThe ESC guidelines define risk as:44\n high risk - annual mortality of >3%\n intermediate risk - annual mortality of 1-3%\n low risk - annual mortality of <1%Patients with stable CAD should be risk stratified using the following parameters:\n clinical evaluation \n resting ECG \n assessment of left ventricular function\n non-invasive assessment of myocardial ischemia\n where indicated, evaluation of coronary anatomy and physiological  \n assessment of the significance of the coronary lesion\n7.1 Risk Stratification of Stable CAD by Clinical Evaluation\nImportant predictors of adverse outcomes in patients with stable CAD \nare:28,63,129–142\n  increasing age  prior MI  symptoms and signs of CHF\n  pattern of occurrence of angina (recent onset or progressive)\n  severity of angina, particularly if unresponsive to therapy\n  presence of atherosclerotic disease in other vascular beds - peripheral  \n  vessels, cerebral and/or aorta  presence of CV risk factors:\n    Diabetes\n    Hypertension\n    Metabolic syndrome\n    Current smoking\n    Dyslipidaemia\n    Family history of premature CAD\n  co-existing medical conditions:\n    Diabetes \n   Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)\n  psychosocial factors \n    Depression\n    Poor social support\nThe above adverse clinical predictors especially the severity of angina help \nmodulate decisions made based on non-invasive tests of ischemia and \nwhere indicated, physiological testing by Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR).In the diagnosis of CAD, these modalities are used in individuals who have \nintermediate PTP of CAD and who:\n  are unable to exercise adequately or\n  have exercise stress ECG with equivocal results or abnormal at moderate  \n  to high workloads, or \n  have un-interpretable ECG that makes interpretation of exercise stress  \n  ECG test difficult. \nIn the presence of LBBB and ventricular paced rhythms, stress imaging \ntechniques are the non-invasive tests of choice although the diagnostic \naccuracy in these situations, is reduced.\n82 \nIn patients with multivessel disease, imaging tests especially Stress MPI can sometimes underestimate the amount of myocardial ischemia. This is because these tests are based on the principle of perfusion differences \nbetween different myocardial territories and therefore require at least one \nnon-ischemic myocardial territory as a “normal” reference to be able to detect \ninducible myocardial ischemia in another territory. If all 3 vessels are                 \nsignificantly narrowed or there is a combination of left main and multivessel CAD, uniform tracer uptake due to “balanced” ischemia may lead to a rather \nhomogeneous tracer uptake and result in a false negative result.\n83-85\n6.2.2.1  Diagnostic Accuracy of Stress echocardiogram - exercise or  \n    pharmacological stress (dobutamine)\nThis is one of the least expensive and most widely available stress imaging \ntechniques.\nAn exercise stress echocardiogram is more physiological than pharmacological \nstress and is the stress of choice wherever possible.86,87\nPharmacological stress is preferred if the patient is unable to exercise or if \nthere are wall motion abnormalities seen at rest. The pharmacological stressor \nmost often used is dobutamine. The increase in cardiac workload seen with \ndobutamine is less than that with exercise. The addition of atropine augments \nthe sensitivity of the dobutamine stress echocardiogram (DSE).86,88 With the \nuse of dobutamine, viability can also be assessed.89\nThe marker for ischemia in stress echocardiogram is absence of wall thickening and inducible new or worsening wall motion abnormalities before, during and after the stress.\n86,87 If severe, there is also a decrease in LV ejection fraction and LV \nenlargement on stress.86,87 The presence of inducible wall motion abnormalities \nimplies significant limitation of blood flow at peak stress, and usually corresponds to a functionally significant stenosis, although the anatomic severity and physiologic \nconsequences are poorly related.\n86\nDSE has good sensitivity and specificity especially in the setting of multivessel \ndisease and previous MI.81,87,90-92 The interpretation is dependent on the adequacy of \nstress. In the diagnosis of CAD, the sensitivity of DSE is reduced in the presence of \nsingle vessel disease, small vessels and distal disease.86 It has greater use in \nprognostication of CAD and for the prediction of myocardial viability.86,87,91,93\nDSE has also a long learning curve and is relatively subjective relying on the human eye for the accurate assessment of myocardial motion. With the usage of myocardial contrast agents or microbubbles, endocardial border delineation is enhanced, and \nimage quality and diagnostic accuracy improved.\n94-96\n6.2.2.2.   Diagnostic Accuracy of Myocardial Perfusion Imaging (MPI) via  \n     SPECT \nMPI most commonly uses technetium-99m sestamibi as the radiotracer and SPECT \nfor imaging. Stress can be either by exercise or pharmacological agents -                    \nadenosine, dipyridamole or dobutamine.\nIschemia is indicated by reduced radiotracer uptake during stress when compared \nwith the uptake at rest. Transient ischaemic dilatation and reduced post-stress LV \nejection fraction are important predictors of severe CAD.\nSPECT detects a relative reduction in myocardial blood volume that occurs earlier \nthan wall thickening abnormality in the ischaemic cascade. Despite this, SPECT has \nnot been shown to be significantly superior to stress echocardiography in terms of \nsensitivity and detecting the extent of CAD.97 This is due to the poorer spatial         \nresolution of SPECT (12mm) as compared to stress echocardiography (2mm).91\nIn the diagnosis of CAD, MPI with SPECT has good sensitivity and specificity.98 The \ndiagnostic image quality is affected in obese patients, as well as in women with large \nbreasts. The diagnostic accuracy is also reduced in the presence of LBBB and \nventricular pacing.82,99 Other disadvantages are the use of ionizing radiation and its \ncost.6.2.2.3  Diagnostic Accuracy of Stress Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR)\nStress CMR with the use of dobutamine can be used to look at regional wall motion \nabnormalities similar to DSE and with a similar safety profile.100-102 In studies on \npatients with high disease prevalence, stress CMR demonstrated overall good sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of CAD.\n103-105 It is particularly useful in \npatients where it is difficult to acquire good echocardiographic images due to poor \nacoustic windows. \nPerfusion CMR (with adenosine) also has good diagnostic accuracy as compared to \nMPI (nuclear studies).101,105-107 It has also demonstrated good correlation with \nPressure wire (Fractional Flow Reserve) measurements.108\n6.3.  Anatomical testing in the Diagnosis of CAD\n6.3.1  Coronary Calcium Score (CAC)\nCalcium accumulates in coronary arteries in an age-related manner. Thus, all scores \nmust be adjusted for age, as well as for sex.109 The relationship of arterial calcification, \nlike that of angiographic coronary artery stenosis, to the probability of plaque rupture is unknown. Vulnerable plaques are frequently present in the absence of calcification.\n109\nCoronary calcium score has been used to detect CAD. Most studies demonstrated a high sensitivity but a much lower specificity, and an overall predictive accuracy of ≈70% in typical CAD patient populations.\n109 CAC was found not to be superior to other \nnon-invasive diagnostic modalities for the detection of CAD.109 In general, a negative \ntest (CAC =0):109\n  makes the presence of atherosclerotic plaques, including unstable plaques,  \n  very unlikely.  is highly unlikely in the presence of significant luminal obstructive disease.\n  occurs in most patients who have angiographically normal coronary arteries.\nCAC score is more useful in CV risk assessment. (Section 7.5.1, pg 56) \nIn the emergency room, CAC may be used in the triage of patients with a negative \nresting ECG and normal cardiac biomarkers. A CAC=0 has a high sensitivity and a \nvery high negative predictive value for CAD.\n110,1116.3.2  Diagnostic Accuracy of Computed Tomography Angiography  \n   (CTA)\nCTA allows visualization of the coronary arteries non-invasively. It can also \ndetermine the extent of coronary calcification, degree of luminal stenosis, degree of luminal remodelling and plaque characteristics. \nIt is usually done as a 2-stage procedure. The first being the quantification of \ncoronary calcium (CAC) and the second is the CTA. The 64-slice detector is \nthe minimum machine requirement. It has a negative predictive value of 93-99% and sensitivity and specificity of 90-94% and 95-97%                                respectively.\n112-120 It is most useful in the diagnostic assessment of individuals \nwith low or intermediate PTP of CAD.112–115\nCareful patient selection and preparation is integral to obtaining good images. These include:  patients with adequate breath holding capabilities.\n  absence of severe obesity.\n • a favourable calcium score (<400 Agatston score) and distribution.   presence of sinus rhythm (absence of ectopics).  heart rate of less than 65 beats per minute.\nA high coronary calcium score reduces the accuracy of the test.\n112 However, \nper-segment calcification (circumferential extent of calcium - arc calcium) has \na stronger influence on diagnostic accuracy than the total calcium score.121 \nCoronary CTA interpretation is less reliable in the presence of coronary stents of <3mm.\n122 In situations where the clinical presentation suggests \nlow-to-intermediate probability for restenosis and in the presence of larger stents, coronary CTA may be a reasonable alternative to invasive                      \nangiography to rule out significant in-stent restenosis.\n123\nIt is highly accurate in the assessment of coronary artery bypass grafts.124 \nThe interpretation of native coronary vessels in post bypass patients is \nhowever, more difficult.124\nCTA may be considered in:\n  individuals with low to intermediate PTP of CAD and who have mild or  \n  equivocal changes of ischemia in the exercise stress test or stress  \n  imaging tests and who are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic with  \n  good exercise capacity.112–115\n7.2 Risk Stratification of Stable CAD by Resting ECG\nResting ECG abnormalities can predict patients at greater risk of future CV \nevents than those with a normal ECG. These abnormalities \ninclude:63,127,133,135,143-145\n evidence of prior MI\n LBBB\n left anterior hemiblock, \n Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH)\n second or third-degree AV block atrial fibrillation (AF)\n7.3 Risk Stratification of Stable CAD by Left Ventricular Function\nLV function is the strongest predictor of survival. Patients with an LVEF of \n<50 % are already at high risk of CV death (annual mortality rate of >3%) \nwithout incorporating other risk factors.\n45,46,133,134,146,147\nIn the presence of a depressed LV function, it is important to determine if this is due to infarcted (scar) tissue or viable but stunned ischemic myocardium. \nThis can be done by stress imaging techniques. In the presence of ischemic \nbut viable myocardium, coronary revascularisation can result in an                    \nimprovement in LV function and survival.\n148\n7.4 Risk Stratification of Stable CAD by Non-invasive Testing \nNon-invasive tests provide useful information for prognostication. (Table 2, \npg 24) A negative test carries a good prognosis but the clinical evaluation \n(e.g. age, ability to exercise, exercise duration, co-morbidity such as \ndiabetes, CKD etc) and LV function should also be considered when              \nassessing CV risk. \nSmall imaging sub studies have shown mixed results when looking at CV \noutcomes in individuals with moderate to severe ischemia treated with \nrevascularization as compared to OMT.149–152 Two large clinical trials have not \nshown any advantage of revascularization as compared to OMT in these patients.\n76,153 In individuals with depressed LV function (LVEF ≤35%) CABG \ndid not reduce all-cause mortality but resulted in a reduction in CV mortality and hospitalizations.\n154 The ISCHEMIA trial is a large randomized clinical trial \nthat is currently underway specifically addressing the role of revascularisation \nversus OMT in patients with moderate to severe myocardial ischemia.155 \nIn patients with unprotected Left Main stem stenosis of > 50%, revascularisation \nby CABG has been shown to improve survival in the pivotal Coronary Artery \nSurgery Study (CASS) Registry.156  In view of this “the benefit of surgery over \nmedical treatment in patients with significant LMS stenosis (greater than 50%) is little argued.” \n157\n7.5.  Risk Stratification of Stable CAD by Anatomic testing\n \n7.5.1  Coronary Calcium (CAC) Score \nCAC scores help with CV risk stratification.158-163 (Table 8, pg 57) It guides risk \nreduction strategy, OMT and the need for further evaluation. CAC score alone was able to predict CHD risk independently of the           \nFramingham Risk Score.\n156,157 When used together with the traditional CV risk \nfactors, it had incremental value in CV risk prediction.164,165 There is a                \nsignificant correlation between CAC score and overall coronary artery         atherosclerotic plaque, with a high sensitivity >95% and a high negative \npredictive value of >95%.\n109,166,167 The CAC score was found to be highly \npredictive of CV risk in 4 ethnic groups - white, black, Hispanic, and \nChinese.168 \nPersons both asymptomatic and symptomatic, with a calcium score =0 have \na low CV event rate and an excellent long-term survival.167,169 However the \nPTP of disease and the clinical setting should be considered when                     \ninterpreting the test result. In interpreting a CAC =0:170\n if the PTP of CAD is low (e.g. asymptomatic individuals), there is low risk  \n of CAD and a low risk of near-term coronary events. \n in older asymptomatic patients with risk factors, there is a moderate   \n increased risk of CV events.\n in persons with clinical signs and symptoms associated with an intermediate  \n to high risk of CAD, there is often associated myocardial ischemia on  \n provocative testing and a high risk of near-term coronary events.1717.5.3  Risk Stratification by Invasive Coronary Angiography (ICA)  \nICA continues to be the “gold standard” in assessing coronary anatomy \nalthough it has its limitations. It cannot detect vulnerable plaques which are in \nmost cases not severe (<50% stenosis) but have a rich lipid core. \nDespite these limitations, the extent and site of coronary lesions provide good \nprognostic indicators. The prognosis is worse if: \n46,146,147\n  the greater the number of vessels involved. • there is left main stem stenosis of >50%.  the proximal LAD is involved.\nRecent large clinical trials did not however, show any improvement in clinical \noutcomes in patients with significant stable CAD when an initial strategy of \ncoronary revascularization was compared to intensive OMT.\n76,153,154\nIn patients who have unprotected left main stem stenosis, CABG has been shown to improve survival when compared to medical therapy in the large \nCASS registry.\n156 Although this trial was performed before the era of current \nintensive OMT, it is considered unethical to repeat it. \nCoronary arteriography should NOT be performed in patients: \n with angina who refuse invasive diagnostic procedures.\n• who prefer to avoid coronary revascularization either by PCI or CABG.\n who are not candidates for PCI or CABG. in whom PCI/CABG will not improve quality-of-life.\n7.5.4  Risk assessment by Physiological Assessment of the functional  \n   severity of coronary lesions \nCoronary angiography is of limited value in defining the functional                   \nsignificance of coronary stenosis. Yet the most important factor related to \noutcome is the presence and extent of inducible ischemia.\n177 If a stenosis is \nnot flow-limiting, it will not cause angina and the prognosis without coronary \nintervention is excellent, with a ‘hard’ event rate (cardiac death or non-fatal \nMI) of <1% per year.175 This event rate was not reduced with PCI and \nstenting.175III, C7.5.4.1 Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR) \nThe functional severity of coronary lesions visualized angiographically may \nbe assessed invasively, by measuring the intracoronary artery pressure or \nFractional Flow Reserve (FFR). FFR is more accurate than visual                       assessment of the significance and severity of coronary lesions.\n176 Even in \nthe presence of angiographically insignificant stenosis, lesions with low FFR showed significantly higher event rates than those with high FFR.\n178\nFFR is presently considered as the ‘gold standard’ for invasive assessment of the significance of coronary stenosis and is useful in decision making in the \nneed for coronary revascularization. This: \n84\n  takes into consideration collateral blood flow.  takes into consideration the amount of viable myocardial mass.\n  is independent of haemodynamic variations.\n  has a high reproducibility. \nFFR is indicated for all coronary artery stenosis of 50-90%, including left main \nstenosis, side branch stenosis, tandem lesions and even in the setting of      \nnon-culprit lesions in ACS.\n84,179-181 In patients with multivessel CAD, PCI \nguided by FFR results in an improved outcome irrespective of available \nnon-invasive functional test results.182-184\nFFR is calculated as the ratio of distal coronary pressure to aortic pressure \nmeasured during maximal hyperaemia with either intracoronary or                        intravenous infusion of adenosine. A normal value for FFR is 1.0 regardless \nof the status of the microcirculation. In individuals on OMT with:\n84,179-184\n • FFR >0.80 - have no improved outcomes with revascularisation.\n  FFR between >0.75 but <0.8 - have intermediate benefit with                        \n  revascularisation and management should be based on clinical  \n  judgement.  • FFR <0.75 - benefit from revascularisation. \nUse of FFR accurately identifies which coronary lesions should be                       \nrevascularized and improves outcome. \nIt is recommended that in individuals with stable CAD, FFR be used to guide \nrevascularization of lesions of intermediate severity.\n182-185\nAt present, there are ongoing studies on the use of instantaneous wave-free \nratio (iFR), a pressure-derived index of stenosis severity that is not obtained \n58Table 8: Coronary Calcium score and CV risk*#\n \n7.5.2  Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA)\nCTA may also be used for prognostication. There is a strong predictive value \nfor mortality and major CV events independent of traditional risk \nfactors.7-9,172-174\nIn assessing prognosis, in patients with: \n • absence of any plaque the CV event rate is low - 0.24% for CV   \n  death/non-fatal MI and an annual mortality of 0.28%.7,8\n  coronary plaque but without stenosis, the mortality rate is higher but  \n  remains below 0.5%.9\n • left main stenosis or proximal triple vessel disease - the hazard ratio for    all-cause mortality is 3.70.\n7\nDespite its’ excellent predictive value, in a randomized controlled trial comparing functional testing with MPI using SPECT and CTA as initial \ndiagnostic strategies in patients with suspected CAD, there were no \ndifferences in clinical outcomes.\n59\nDue to the potential overestimation of obstructive coronary disease by CTA, \nit may be advisable to perform additional testing for the presence of ischemia \nprior to revascularization in the asymptomatic individual.175,176with the administration of a vasodilator such as adenosine.186-188 The cut-off \npoint is 0.89 when compared to 0.80 for FFR.186 The initial clinical trials \nindicate that an iFR-guided revascularization strategy was non-inferior to an \nFFR-guided revascularization strategy.187,188\nFFR may also be assessed using CT. A recent meta-analysis showed that FFR\nCT achieves a moderate diagnostic performance for non-invasive              \nidentification of ischemic lesions in stable patients with suspected or known CAD in comparison to invasive FFR measurement.\n189 This tool is not yet \nwidely available.\n7.5.4.2  Intravascular Ultrasound / Optical Coherence Tomography\nFFR provides physiological assessment of the severity of a coronary lesion, \nwhile intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and optical coherence tomography \n(OCT) allow visual assessment of the lesion. IVUS makes use of the \nminimum lumen area (MLA) as the marker for significance of coronary \nstenosis. Overall, IVUS studies showed a relatively high negative predictive \nvalue but a low positive predictive value for ischemia.190\nBoth IVUS and OCT should not be performed to determine the functional significance of a coronary lesion before intervention.\n191 These are useful in \noptimizing stent deployment and determining the size of the vessel                   undergoing stent implantation.\n7.6  Guidelines for referral to a tertiary cardiac center\nFollowing risk stratification:\nLow risk individuals  should be managed with risk factor reduction and/or \nanti anginal medications as necessary. No further intervention is required. \nIntermediate risk individuals  may be managed with risk reduction \nstrategies +/- anti anginal therapy or considered for invasive coronary \nangiogram and revascularization depending on the clinical condition and \npatient preferences."

Diagnostic Accuracy of Myocardial Perfusion Imaging (MPI) via  \n     SPECT \nMPI most commonly uses technetium-99m sestamibi as the radiotracer and SPECT \nfor imaging.

Transient ischaemic dilatation and reduced post-stress LV \nejection fraction are important predictors of severe CAD.\nSPECT detects a relative reduction in myocardial blood volume that occurs earlier \nthan wall thickening abnormality in the ischaemic cascade. Despite this, SPECT has \nnot been shown to be significantly superior to stress echocardiography in terms of \nsensitivity and detecting the extent of CAD.97 This is due to the poorer spatial         \nresolution of SPECT (12mm) as compared to stress echocardiography (2mm).91\nIn the diagnosis of CAD, MPI with SPECT has good sensitivity and specificity.98 The \ndiagnostic image quality is affected in obese patients, as well as in women with large \nbreasts. The diagnostic accuracy is also reduced in the presence of LBBB and \nventricular pacing.82,99 Other disadvantages are the use of ionizing radiation and its \ncost.6.2.2.3  Diagnostic Accuracy of Stress Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR)\nStress CMR with the use of dobutamine can be used to look at regional wall motion \nabnormalities similar to DSE and with a similar safety profile.100-102 In studies on \npatients with high disease prevalence, stress CMR demonstrated overall good sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of CAD.\n103-105 It is particularly useful in \npatients where it is difficult to acquire good echocardiographic images due to poor \nacoustic windows. \nPerfusion CMR (with adenosine) also has good diagnostic accuracy as compared to \nMPI (nuclear studies).101,105-107 It has also demonstrated good correlation with \nPressure wire (Fractional Flow Reserve) measurements.108\n6.3.  Anatomical testing in the Diagnosis of CAD\n6.3.1  Coronary Calcium Score (CAC)\nCalcium accumulates in coronary arteries in an age-related manner. Thus, all scores \nmust be adjusted for age, as well as for sex.109 The relationship of arterial calcification, \nlike that of angiographic coronary artery stenosis, to the probability of plaque rupture is unknown. Vulnerable plaques are frequently present in the absence of calcification.\n109\nCoronary calcium score has been used to detect CAD. Most studies demonstrated a high sensitivity but a much lower specificity, and an overall predictive accuracy of ≈70% in typical CAD patient populations.\n109 CAC was found not to be superior to other \nnon-invasive diagnostic modalities for the detection of CAD.109 In general, a negative \ntest (CAC =0):109\n  makes the presence of atherosclerotic plaques, including unstable plaques,  \n  very unlikely.  is highly unlikely in the presence of significant luminal obstructive disease.\n  occurs in most patients who have angiographically normal coronary arteries.\nCAC score is more useful in CV risk assessment. (Section 7.5.1, pg 56) \nIn the emergency room, CAC may be used in the triage of patients with a negative \nresting ECG and normal cardiac biomarkers. A CAC=0 has a high sensitivity and a \nvery high negative predictive value for CAD.\n110,1116.3.2  Diagnostic Accuracy of Computed Tomography Angiography  \n   (CTA)\nCTA allows visualization of the coronary arteries non-invasively. It can also \ndetermine the extent of coronary calcification, degree of luminal stenosis, degree of luminal remodelling and plaque characteristics. \nIt is usually done as a 2-stage procedure. The first being the quantification of \ncoronary calcium (CAC) and the second is the CTA. The 64-slice detector is \nthe minimum machine requirement. It has a negative predictive value of 93-99% and sensitivity and specificity of 90-94% and 95-97%                                respectively.\n112-120 It is most useful in the diagnostic assessment of individuals \nwith low or intermediate PTP of CAD.112–115\nCareful patient selection and preparation is integral to obtaining good images. These include:  patients with adequate breath holding capabilities.\n  absence of severe obesity.\n • a favourable calcium score (<400 Agatston score) and distribution.   presence of sinus rhythm (absence of ectopics).  heart rate of less than 65 beats per minute.\nA high coronary calcium score reduces the accuracy of the test.\n112 However, \nper-segment calcification (circumferential extent of calcium - arc calcium) has \na stronger influence on diagnostic accuracy than the total calcium score.121 \nCoronary CTA interpretation is less reliable in the presence of coronary stents of <3mm.\n122 In situations where the clinical presentation suggests \nlow-to-intermediate probability for restenosis and in the presence of larger stents, coronary CTA may be a reasonable alternative to invasive                      \nangiography to rule out significant in-stent restenosis.\n123\nIt is highly accurate in the assessment of coronary artery bypass grafts.124 \nThe interpretation of native coronary vessels in post bypass patients is \nhowever, more difficult.124\nCTA may be considered in:\n  individuals with low to intermediate PTP of CAD and who have mild or  \n  equivocal changes of ischemia in the exercise stress test or stress  \n  imaging tests and who are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic with  \n  good exercise capacity.112–115\n7.2 Risk Stratification of Stable CAD by Resting ECG\nResting ECG abnormalities can predict patients at greater risk of future CV \nevents than those with a normal ECG. These abnormalities \ninclude:63,127,133,135,143-145\n evidence of prior MI\n LBBB\n left anterior hemiblock, \n Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH)\n second or third-degree AV block atrial fibrillation (AF)\n7.3 Risk Stratification of Stable CAD by Left Ventricular Function\nLV function is the strongest predictor of survival. Patients with an LVEF of \n<50 % are already at high risk of CV death (annual mortality rate of >3%) \nwithout incorporating other risk factors.\n45,46,133,134,146,147\nIn the presence of a depressed LV function, it is important to determine if this is due to infarcted (scar) tissue or viable but stunned ischemic myocardium. \nThis can be done by stress imaging techniques. In the presence of ischemic \nbut viable myocardium, coronary revascularisation can result in an                    \nimprovement in LV function and survival.\n148\n7.4 Risk Stratification of Stable CAD by Non-invasive Testing \nNon-invasive tests provide useful information for prognostication. (Table 2, \npg 24) A negative test carries a good prognosis but the clinical evaluation \n(e.g. age, ability to exercise, exercise duration, co-morbidity such as \ndiabetes, CKD etc) and LV function should also be considered when              \nassessing CV risk. \nSmall imaging sub studies have shown mixed results when looking at CV \noutcomes in individuals with moderate to severe ischemia treated with \nrevascularization as compared to OMT.149–152 Two large clinical trials have not \nshown any advantage of revascularization as compared to OMT in these patients.\n76,153 In individuals with depressed LV function (LVEF ≤35%) CABG \ndid not reduce all-cause mortality but resulted in a reduction in CV mortality and hospitalizations.\n154 The ISCHEMIA trial is a large randomized clinical trial \nthat is currently underway specifically addressing the role of revascularisation \nversus OMT in patients with moderate to severe myocardial ischemia.155 \nIn patients with unprotected Left Main stem stenosis of > 50%, revascularisation \nby CABG has been shown to improve survival in the pivotal Coronary Artery \nSurgery Study (CASS) Registry.156  In view of this “the benefit of surgery over \nmedical treatment in patients with significant LMS stenosis (greater than 50%) is little argued.” \n157\n7.5.  Risk Stratification of Stable CAD by Anatomic testing\n \n7.5.1  Coronary Calcium (CAC) Score \nCAC scores help with CV risk stratification.158-163 (Table 8, pg 57) It guides risk \nreduction strategy, OMT and the need for further evaluation. CAC score alone was able to predict CHD risk independently of the           \nFramingham Risk Score.\n156,157 When used together with the traditional CV risk \nfactors, it had incremental value in CV risk prediction.164,165 There is a                \nsignificant correlation between CAC score and overall coronary artery         atherosclerotic plaque, with a high sensitivity >95% and a high negative \npredictive value of >95%.\n109,166,167 The CAC score was found to be highly \npredictive of CV risk in 4 ethnic groups - white, black, Hispanic, and \nChinese.168 \nPersons both asymptomatic and symptomatic, with a calcium score =0 have \na low CV event rate and an excellent long-term survival.167,169 However the \nPTP of disease and the clinical setting should be considered when                     \ninterpreting the test result. In interpreting a CAC =0:170\n if the PTP of CAD is low (e.g. asymptomatic individuals), there is low risk  \n of CAD and a low risk of near-term coronary events. \n in older asymptomatic patients with risk factors, there is a moderate   \n increased risk of CV events.\n in persons with clinical signs and symptoms associated with an intermediate  \n to high risk of CAD, there is often associated myocardial ischemia on  \n provocative testing and a high risk of near-term coronary events.1717.5.3  Risk Stratification by Invasive Coronary Angiography (ICA)  \nICA continues to be the “gold standard” in assessing coronary anatomy \nalthough it has its limitations. It cannot detect vulnerable plaques which are in \nmost cases not severe (<50% stenosis) but have a rich lipid core. \nDespite these limitations, the extent and site of coronary lesions provide good \nprognostic indicators. The prognosis is worse if: \n46,146,147\n  the greater the number of vessels involved. • there is left main stem stenosis of >50%.  the proximal LAD is involved.\nRecent large clinical trials did not however, show any improvement in clinical \noutcomes in patients with significant stable CAD when an initial strategy of \ncoronary revascularization was compared to intensive OMT.\n76,153,154\nIn patients who have unprotected left main stem stenosis, CABG has been shown to improve survival when compared to medical therapy in the large \nCASS registry.\n156 Although this trial was performed before the era of current \nintensive OMT, it is considered unethical to repeat it. \nCoronary arteriography should NOT be performed in patients: \n with angina who refuse invasive diagnostic procedures.\n• who prefer to avoid coronary revascularization either by PCI or CABG.\n who are not candidates for PCI or CABG. in whom PCI/CABG will not improve quality-of-life.\n7.5.4  Risk assessment by Physiological Assessment of the functional  \n   severity of coronary lesions \nCoronary angiography is of limited value in defining the functional                   \nsignificance of coronary stenosis. Yet the most important factor related to \noutcome is the presence and extent of inducible ischemia.\n177 If a stenosis is \nnot flow-limiting, it will not cause angina and the prognosis without coronary \nintervention is excellent, with a ‘hard’ event rate (cardiac death or non-fatal \nMI) of <1% per year.175 This event rate was not reduced with PCI and \nstenting.1757.5.4.1 Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR) \nThe functional severity of coronary lesions visualized angiographically may \nbe assessed invasively, by measuring the intracoronary artery pressure or \nFractional Flow Reserve (FFR). FFR is more accurate than visual                       assessment of the significance and severity of coronary lesions.\n176 Even in \nthe presence of angiographically insignificant stenosis, lesions with low FFR showed significantly higher event rates than those with high FFR.\n178\nFFR is presently considered as the ‘gold standard’ for invasive assessment of the significance of coronary stenosis and is useful in decision making in the \nneed for coronary revascularization. This: \n84\n  takes into consideration collateral blood flow.  takes into consideration the amount of viable myocardial mass.\n  is independent of haemodynamic variations.\n  has a high reproducibility. \nFFR is indicated for all coronary artery stenosis of 50-90%, including left main \nstenosis, side branch stenosis, tandem lesions and even in the setting of      \nnon-culprit lesions in ACS.\n84,179-181 In patients with multivessel CAD, PCI \nguided by FFR results in an improved outcome irrespective of available \nnon-invasive functional test results.182-184\nFFR is calculated as the ratio of distal coronary pressure to aortic pressure \nmeasured during maximal hyperaemia with either intracoronary or                        intravenous infusion of adenosine. A normal value for FFR is 1.0 regardless \nof the status of the microcirculation. In individuals on OMT with:\n84,179-184\n • FFR >0.80 - have no improved outcomes with revascularisation.\n  FFR between >0.75 but <0.8 - have intermediate benefit with                         \n  revascularisation and management should be based on clinical  \n  judgement.  • FFR <0.75 - benefit from revascularisation. \nUse of FFR accurately identifies which coronary lesions should be                       \nrevascularized and improves outcome. \nIt is recommended that in individuals with stable CAD, FFR be used to guide \nrevascularization of lesions of intermediate severity.\n182-185\nAt present, there are ongoing studies on the use of instantaneous wave-free \nratio (iFR), a pressure-derived index of stenosis severity that is not obtained \n59Table 8: Coronary Calcium score and CV risk*#\n \n7.5.2  Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA)\nCTA may also be used for prognostication. There is a strong predictive value \nfor mortality and major CV events independent of traditional risk \nfactors.7-9,172-174\nIn assessing prognosis, in patients with: \n • absence of any plaque the CV event rate is low - 0.24% for CV   \n  death/non-fatal MI and an annual mortality of 0.28%.7,8\n  coronary plaque but without stenosis, the mortality rate is higher but  \n  remains below 0.5%.9\n • left main stenosis or proximal triple vessel disease - the hazard ratio for    all-cause mortality is 3.70.\n7\nDespite its’ excellent predictive value, in a randomized controlled trial comparing functional testing with MPI using SPECT and CTA as initial \ndiagnostic strategies in patients with suspected CAD, there were no \ndifferences in clinical outcomes.\n59\nDue to the potential overestimation of obstructive coronary disease by CTA, \nit may be advisable to perform additional testing for the presence of ischemia \nprior to revascularization in the asymptomatic individual.175,176 I, Awith the administration of a vasodilator such as adenosine.186-188 The cut-off \npoint is 0.89 when compared to 0.80 for FFR.186 The initial clinical trials \nindicate that an iFR-guided revascularization strategy was non-inferior to an FFR-guided revascularization strategy.\n187,188\nFFR may also be assessed using CT. A recent meta-analysis showed that FFR\nCT achieves a moderate diagnostic performance for non-invasive              \nidentification of ischemic lesions in stable patients with suspected or known CAD in comparison to invasive FFR measurement.\n189 This tool is not yet \nwidely available.\n7.5.4.2  Intravascular Ultrasound / Optical Coherence Tomography\nFFR provides physiological assessment of the severity of a coronary lesion, \nwhile intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and optical coherence tomography \n(OCT) allow visual assessment of the lesion. IVUS makes use of the \nminimum lumen area (MLA) as the marker for significance of coronary \nstenosis. Overall, IVUS studies showed a relatively high negative predictive \nvalue but a low positive predictive value for ischemia.190\nBoth IVUS and OCT should not be performed to determine the functional significance of a coronary lesion before intervention.\n191 These are useful in \noptimizing stent deployment and determining the size of the vessel                   undergoing stent implantation.\n7.6  Guidelines for referral to a tertiary cardiac center\nFollowing risk stratification:\nLow risk individuals  should be managed with risk factor reduction and/or \nanti anginal medications as necessary. No further intervention is required. \nIntermediate risk individuals  may be managed with risk reduction \nstrategies +/- anti anginal therapy or considered for invasive coronary \nangiogram and revascularization depending on the clinical condition and \npatient preferences."

The diagnostic \nperformance of these modalities is almost similar and the preference to use one \nimaging modality or the other depends on local expertise and availability.3,81\nThe choice of stress imaging technique will depend on:\n  the patient - ability to exercise, obesity, lung problems which may affect image  \n  quality. \n  local resources and expertise.\nPrior to performing the test, the following should be considered:\n  the modality is performed and interpreted by adequately trained personnel.\n  each modality of testing has its own inherent risk e.g. radiation, contrast  \n  sensitivity, bodily injury and interpretation error which should be explained to  \n  the patient.   \nCTA should not be used as a screening test for CAD in the asymptomatic \nindividual. \nDue to the low prevalence of disease in most individuals undergoing health \nscreening, there tends to be too many false-positive lesions. Also, many minor lesions not causing ischemia may be found, potentially resulting in \nunnecessary downstream invasive procedures and intervention.\n6.3.3  Diagnostic Accuracy of Invasive Coronary Angiography (ICA)\nInvasive Coronary angiography has been the “gold standard” for the                 \ndiagnosis of CAD. It can detect obstructive lesions with negative remodelling \naccurately but unlike CTA, it may not be able to detect non-obstructive \nlesions with positive remodelling where the lumen diameter may be \nmaintained.\nICA is rarely necessary in stable patients with suspected CAD for the sole \npurpose of establishing the diagnosis of CAD. It is indicated, following       \nnon-invasive risk stratification, to determine the most appropriate mode of \nrevascularization. \n7.  RISK STRATIFICATION IN STABLE CAD\nThe objectives of risk stratification in stable CAD are for: \n prognosis choosing the appropriate management strategy (e.g. revascularisation in high risk  \n groups)\nAbsolute levels of what constitutes high risk and low risk are not clearly defined for \nthose with stable CAD. There are several risk assessment scores for individuals with stable CAD using different CV end points.\n1,2,64,125-128\nThe ESC guidelines define risk as:44\n high risk - annual mortality of >3%\n intermediate risk - annual mortality of 1-3%\n low risk - annual mortality of <1%Patients with stable CAD should be risk stratified using the following parameters:\n clinical evaluation \n resting ECG \n assessment of left ventricular function\n non-invasive assessment of myocardial ischemia\n where indicated, evaluation of coronary anatomy and physiological  \n assessment of the significance of the coronary lesion\n7.1 Risk Stratification of Stable CAD by Clinical Evaluation\nImportant predictors of adverse outcomes in patients with stable CAD \nare:28,63,129–142\n  increasing age  prior MI  symptoms and signs of CHF\n  pattern of occurrence of angina (recent onset or progressive)\n  severity of angina, particularly if unresponsive to therapy\n  presence of atherosclerotic disease in other vascular beds - peripheral  \n  vessels, cerebral and/or aorta  presence of CV risk factors:\n    Diabetes\n    Hypertension\n    Metabolic syndrome\n    Current smoking\n    Dyslipidaemia\n    Family history of premature CAD\n  co-existing medical conditions:\n    Diabetes \n   Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)\n  psychosocial factors \n    Depression\n    Poor social support\nThe above adverse clinical predictors especially the severity of angina help \nmodulate decisions made based on non-invasive tests of ischemia and \nwhere indicated, physiological testing by Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR).In the diagnosis of CAD, these modalities are used in individuals who have \nintermediate PTP of CAD and who:\n  are unable to exercise adequately or\n  have exercise stress ECG with equivocal results or abnormal at moderate  \n  to high workloads, or \n  have un-interpretable ECG that makes interpretation of exercise stress  \n  ECG test difficult. \nIn the presence of LBBB and ventricular paced rhythms, stress imaging \ntechniques are the non-invasive tests of choice although the diagnostic \naccuracy in these situations, is reduced.\n82 \nIn patients with multivessel disease, imaging tests especially Stress MPI can sometimes underestimate the amount of myocardial ischemia. This is because these tests are based on the principle of perfusion differences \nbetween different myocardial territories and therefore require at least one \nnon-ischemic myocardial territory as a “normal” reference to be able to detect \ninducible myocardial ischemia in another territory. If all 3 vessels are                 \nsignificantly narrowed or there is a combination of left main and multivessel CAD, uniform tracer uptake due to “balanced” ischemia may lead to a rather \nhomogeneous tracer uptake and result in a false negative result.\n83-85\n6.2.2.1  Diagnostic Accuracy of Stress echocardiogram - exercise or  \n    pharmacological stress (dobutamine)\nThis is one of the least expensive and most widely available stress imaging \ntechniques.\nAn exercise stress echocardiogram is more physiological than pharmacological \nstress and is the stress of choice wherever possible.86,87\nPharmacological stress is preferred if the patient is unable to exercise or if \nthere are wall motion abnormalities seen at rest.

These include:  patients with adequate breath holding capabilities.\n  absence of severe obesity.\n • a favourable calcium score (<400 Agatston score) and distribution.   presence of sinus rhythm (absence of ectopics).  heart rate of less than 65 beats per minute.\nA high coronary calcium score reduces the accuracy of the test.\n112 However, \nper-segment calcification (circumferential extent of calcium - arc calcium) has \na stronger influence on diagnostic accuracy than the total calcium score.121 \nCoronary CTA interpretation is less reliable in the presence of coronary stents of <3mm.\n122 In situations where the clinical presentation suggests \nlow-to-intermediate probability for restenosis and in the presence of larger stents, coronary CTA may be a reasonable alternative to invasive                      \nangiography to rule out significant in-stent restenosis.\n123\nIt is highly accurate in the assessment of coronary artery bypass grafts.124 \nThe interpretation of native coronary vessels in post bypass patients is \nhowever, more difficult.124\nCTA may be considered in:\n  individuals with low to intermediate PTP of CAD and who have mild or  \n  equivocal changes of ischemia in the exercise stress test or stress  \n  imaging tests and who are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic with  \n  good exercise capacity.112–115\n7.2 Risk Stratification of Stable CAD by Resting ECG\nResting ECG abnormalities can predict patients at greater risk of future CV \nevents than those with a normal ECG. These abnormalities \ninclude:63,127,133,135,143-145\n evidence of prior MI\n LBBB\n left anterior hemiblock, \n Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH)\n second or third-degree AV block atrial fibrillation (AF)\n7.3 Risk Stratification of Stable CAD by Left Ventricular Function\nLV function is the strongest predictor of survival. Patients with an LVEF of \n<50 % are already at high risk of CV death (annual mortality rate of >3%) \nwithout incorporating other risk factors.\n45,46,133,134,146,147\nIn the presence of a depressed LV function, it is important to determine if this is due to infarcted (scar) tissue or viable but stunned ischemic myocardium. \nThis can be done by stress imaging techniques. In the presence of ischemic \nbut viable myocardium, coronary revascularisation can result in an                    \nimprovement in LV function and survival.\n148\n7.4 Risk Stratification of Stable CAD by Non-invasive Testing \nNon-invasive tests provide useful information for prognostication. (Table 2, \npg 24) A negative test carries a good prognosis but the clinical evaluation \n(e.g. age, ability to exercise, exercise duration, co-morbidity such as \ndiabetes, CKD etc) and LV function should also be considered when              \nassessing CV risk. \nSmall imaging sub studies have shown mixed results when looking at CV \noutcomes in individuals with moderate to severe ischemia treated with \nrevascularization as compared to OMT.149–152 Two large clinical trials have not \nshown any advantage of revascularization as compared to OMT in these patients.\n76,153 In individuals with depressed LV function (LVEF ≤35%) CABG \ndid not reduce all-cause mortality but resulted in a reduction in CV mortality and hospitalizations.\n154 The ISCHEMIA trial is a large randomized clinical trial \nthat is currently underway specifically addressing the role of revascularisation \nversus OMT in patients with moderate to severe myocardial ischemia.155 \nIn patients with unprotected Left Main stem stenosis of > 50%, revascularisation \nby CABG has been shown to improve survival in the pivotal Coronary Artery \nSurgery Study (CASS) Registry.156  In view of this “the benefit of surgery over \nmedical treatment in patients with significant LMS stenosis (greater than 50%) is little argued.” \n157\n7.5.  Risk Stratification of Stable CAD by Anatomic testing\n \n7.5.1  Coronary Calcium (CAC) Score \nCAC scores help with CV risk stratification.158-163 (Table 8, pg 57) It guides risk \nreduction strategy, OMT and the need for further evaluation. CAC score alone was able to predict CHD risk independently of the           \nFramingham Risk Score.\n156,157 When used together with the traditional CV risk \nfactors, it had incremental value in CV risk prediction.164,165 There is a                \nsignificant correlation between CAC score and overall coronary artery         atherosclerotic plaque, with a high sensitivity >95% and a high negative \npredictive value of >95%.\n109,166,167 The CAC score was found to be highly \npredictive of CV risk in 4 ethnic groups - white, black, Hispanic, and \nChinese.168 \nPersons both asymptomatic and symptomatic, with a calcium score =0 have \na low CV event rate and an excellent long-term survival.167,169 However the \nPTP of disease and the clinical setting should be considered when                     \ninterpreting the test result. In interpreting a CAC =0:170\n if the PTP of CAD is low (e.g. asymptomatic individuals), there is low risk  \n of CAD and a low risk of near-term coronary events. \n in older asymptomatic patients with risk factors, there is a moderate   \n increased risk of CV events.\n in persons with clinical signs and symptoms associated with an intermediate  \n to high risk of CAD, there is often associated myocardial ischemia on  \n provocative testing and a high risk of near-term coronary events.1717.5.3  Risk Stratification by Invasive Coronary Angiography (ICA)  \nICA continues to be the “gold standard” in assessing coronary anatomy \nalthough it has its limitations. It cannot detect vulnerable plaques which are in \nmost cases not severe (<50% stenosis) but have a rich lipid core. \nDespite these limitations, the extent and site of coronary lesions provide good \nprognostic indicators. The prognosis is worse if: \n46,146,147\n  the greater the number of vessels involved. • there is left main stem stenosis of >50%.  the proximal LAD is involved.\nRecent large clinical trials did not however, show any improvement in clinical \noutcomes in patients with significant stable CAD when an initial strategy of \ncoronary revascularization was compared to intensive OMT.\n76,153,154\nIn patients who have unprotected left main stem stenosis, CABG has been shown to improve survival when compared to medical therapy in the large \nCASS registry.\n156 Although this trial was performed before the era of current \nintensive OMT, it is considered unethical to repeat it. \nCoronary arteriography should NOT be performed in patients: \n with angina who refuse invasive diagnostic procedures.\n• who prefer to avoid coronary revascularization either by PCI or CABG.\n who are not candidates for PCI or CABG. in whom PCI/CABG will not improve quality-of-life.\n7.5.4  Risk assessment by Physiological Assessment of the functional  \n   severity of coronary lesions \nCoronary angiography is of limited value in defining the functional                   \nsignificance of coronary stenosis. Yet the most important factor related to \noutcome is the presence and extent of inducible ischemia.\n177 If a stenosis is \nnot flow-limiting, it will not cause angina and the prognosis without coronary \nintervention is excellent, with a ‘hard’ event rate (cardiac death or non-fatal \nMI) of <1% per year.175 This event rate was not reduced with PCI and \nstenting.1757.5.4.1 Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR) \nThe functional severity of coronary lesions visualized angiographically may \nbe assessed invasively, by measuring the intracoronary artery pressure or \nFractional Flow Reserve (FFR). FFR is more accurate than visual                       assessment of the significance and severity of coronary lesions.\n176 Even in \nthe presence of angiographically insignificant stenosis, lesions with low FFR showed significantly higher event rates than those with high FFR.\n178\nFFR is presently considered as the ‘gold standard’ for invasive assessment of the significance of coronary stenosis and is useful in decision making in the \nneed for coronary revascularization. This: \n84\n  takes into consideration collateral blood flow.  takes into consideration the amount of viable myocardial mass.\n  is independent of haemodynamic variations.\n  has a high reproducibility. \nFFR is indicated for all coronary artery stenosis of 50-90%, including left main \nstenosis, side branch stenosis, tandem lesions and even in the setting of      \nnon-culprit lesions in ACS.\n84,179-181 In patients with multivessel CAD, PCI \nguided by FFR results in an improved outcome irrespective of available \nnon-invasive functional test results.182-184\nFFR is calculated as the ratio of distal coronary pressure to aortic pressure \nmeasured during maximal hyperaemia with either intracoronary or                        intravenous infusion of adenosine. A normal value for FFR is 1.0 regardless \nof the status of the microcirculation. In individuals on OMT with:\n84,179-184\n • FFR >0.80 - have no improved outcomes with revascularisation.\n  FFR between >0.75 but <0.8 - have intermediate benefit with                        \n  revascularisation and management should be based on clinical  \n  judgement.  • FFR <0.75 - benefit from revascularisation. \nUse of FFR accurately identifies which coronary lesions should be                       \nrevascularized and improves outcome. \nIt is recommended that in individuals with stable CAD, FFR be used to guide \nrevascularization of lesions of intermediate severity.\n182-185\nAt present, there are ongoing studies on the use of instantaneous wave-free \nratio (iFR), a pressure-derived index of stenosis severity that is not obtained \n60Table 8: Coronary Calcium score and CV risk*#\n \n7.5.2  Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA)\nCTA may also be used for prognostication. There is a strong predictive value \nfor mortality and major CV events independent of traditional risk \nfactors.7-9,172-174\nIn assessing prognosis, in patients with: \n • absence of any plaque the CV event rate is low - 0.24% for CV   \n  death/non-fatal MI and an annual mortality of 0.28%.7,8\n  coronary plaque but without stenosis, the mortality rate is higher but  \n  remains below 0.5%.9\n • left main stenosis or proximal triple vessel disease - the hazard ratio for    all-cause mortality is 3.70.\n7\nDespite its’ excellent predictive value, in a randomized controlled trial comparing functional testing with MPI using SPECT and CTA as initial \ndiagnostic strategies in patients with suspected CAD, there were no \ndifferences in clinical outcomes.\n59\nDue to the potential overestimation of obstructive coronary disease by CTA, \nit may be advisable to perform additional testing for the presence of ischemia \nprior to revascularization in the asymptomatic individual.175,176with the administration of a vasodilator such as adenosine.186-188 The cut-off \npoint is 0.89 when compared to 0.80 for FFR.186 The initial clinical trials \nindicate that an iFR-guided revascularization strategy was non-inferior to an \nFFR-guided revascularization strategy.187,188\nFFR may also be assessed using CT. A recent meta-analysis showed that FFR\nCT achieves a moderate diagnostic performance for non-invasive              \nidentification of ischemic lesions in stable patients with suspected or known CAD in comparison to invasive FFR measurement.\n189 This tool is not yet \nwidely available.\n7.5.4.2  Intravascular Ultrasound / Optical Coherence Tomography\nFFR provides physiological assessment of the severity of a coronary lesion, \nwhile intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and optical coherence tomography \n(OCT) allow visual assessment of the lesion. IVUS makes use of the \nminimum lumen area (MLA) as the marker for significance of coronary \nstenosis. Overall, IVUS studies showed a relatively high negative predictive \nvalue but a low positive predictive value for ischemia.190\nBoth IVUS and OCT should not be performed to determine the functional significance of a coronary lesion before intervention.\n191 These are useful in \noptimizing stent deployment and determining the size of the vessel                   undergoing stent implantation.\n7.6  Guidelines for referral to a tertiary cardiac center\nFollowing risk stratification:\nLow risk individuals  should be managed with risk factor reduction and/or \nanti anginal medications as necessary. No further intervention is required. \nIntermediate risk individuals  may be managed with risk reduction \nstrategies +/- anti anginal therapy or considered for invasive coronary \nangiogram and revascularization depending on the clinical condition and \npatient preferences.IIa,B"

MANAGEMENT (Fig 2, pg 25)\nThe treatment goals in stable CAD are to:\n  alleviate symptoms and improve quality of life,  reduce risk of adverse CV outcomes and improve survival and\n  prevent progression of atherosclerotic disease. \nOptimal Medical Therapy (OMT) is the cornerstone of management of \npatients with both obstructive and non-obstructive CAD.\n72,76,153,154 It has been \nshown to improve prognosis, reduce symptoms and myocardial ischemia.\n72,76,153,154\nOMT involves:  intensive lifestyle changes (healthy diet, regular physical activity,  \n  smoking cessation and optimal management of risk factors and weight)  \n  and\n  pharmacotherapy which includes: \n   anti-platelet agents and \n   statins to achieve target LDL-C.\nIn addition, ACEi, β-blockers and anti-anginal medications may be necessary \nto treat co-existing hypertension, LV dysfunction and/or angina.\n \nThe management of these patients with Stable CAD should be multifaceted and include:\n  behavioural modification therapy (BMT) - patient education and lifestyle  \n  modification and \n  pharmacological therapy and\n  myocardial revascularization when indicated.\nAll patients should be educated on behavioural modification therapy and \nreceive OMT for survival benefit. Treatment of CV risk factors to target and adherence to treatment recommendations should also be addressed.Table 9: Nutritional Recommendations\nWarfarin is indicated in patients with Stable CAD for:\n Valvular and non-valvular AF both paroxysmal and persistent.\n22,261,262\n LV thrombus - In patients with stable CAD and depressed LV function and  \n a LV thrombus demonstrated for the first time by echocardiography,  warfarin  \n for at least 6 months may be considered.High risk individuals  in addition to risk reduction strategies, should be considered \nfor invasive coronary angiography with view to revascularization.\nLow risk individuals  can be managed in the general outpatient clinics with Family \nMedicine Specialists. Intermediate and high risk individuals should be referred to \ntertiary cardiac centers for further evaluation and revascularisation as indicated.\n8.1.4  Smoking Cessation\nSmoking is an independent risk factor for CVD.215\nIt also interacts with other CV risk factors, such as glucose intolerance and \nlow serum levels of HDL-C in a multiplicative manner215–217 Examples:\n  the presence of smoking alone is reported to double the level of risk, but  \n  the simultaneous presence of another major risk factor is estimated to  \n  quadruple the risk (2 × 2).215\n  the presence of two other risk factors with smoking may result in approx \n  imately eight times the risk (2 × 2 × 2) of persons with no risk factors.215\nSmoking is an important cause of plaque rupture leading to ACS.218 Data from \nthe NCVD-ACS Registry 2014-2015 showed that 37% of patients were smokers.\n30 In the INTERHEART study, a dose response relationship was \ndemonstrated between the number of cigarettes smoked and MI, where smokers who smoked >40 cig/day were found to have a 9-fold relative risk of \nMI compared with non-smokers.\n219\nChanging cigarette designs such as filtered, low-tar, and “light” variations, \nhave not reduced overall disease risk among smokers.215\nStopping smoking after an MI is the most effective prevention measure.215 \nThere is significant reduction on morbidity within the first 6 months of quitting and the risks of CVD almost equals the risk of never smokers after 10-15 \nyears of cessation.\n215\nPatients may be referred to the mQuit Services. Currently this smoking \ncessation service is being implemented both in government and private facilities including general practice clinics, private hospital and community \npharmacies.

MANAGEMENT (Fig 2, pg 25)\nThe treatment goals in stable CAD are to:\n  alleviate symptoms and improve quality of life,  reduce risk of adverse CV outcomes and improve survival and\n  prevent progression of atherosclerotic disease. \nOptimal Medical Therapy (OMT) is the cornerstone of management of \npatients with both obstructive and non-obstructive CAD.\n72,76,153,154 It has been \nshown to improve prognosis, reduce symptoms and myocardial ischemia.\n72,76,153,154\nOMT involves:  intensive lifestyle changes (healthy diet, regular physical activity,  \n  smoking cessation and optimal management of risk factors and weight)  \n  and\n  pharmacotherapy which includes: \n   anti-platelet agents and \n   statins to achieve target LDL-C.\nIn addition, ACEi, β-blockers and anti-anginal medications may be necessary \nto treat co-existing hypertension, LV dysfunction and/or angina.\n \nThe management of these patients with Stable CAD should be multifaceted and include:\n  behavioural modification therapy (BMT) - patient education and lifestyle  \n  modification and \n  pharmacological therapy and\n  myocardial revascularization when indicated.\nAll patients should be educated on behavioural modification therapy and \nreceive OMT for survival benefit. Treatment of CV risk factors to target and adherence to treatment recommendations should also be addressed.Table 9: Nutritional Recommendations\nWarfarin is indicated in patients with Stable CAD for:\n Valvular and non-valvular AF both paroxysmal and persistent.\n22,261,262\n LV thrombus - In patients with stable CAD and depressed LV function and  \n a LV thrombus demonstrated for the first time by echocardiography,  warfarin  \n for at least 6 months may be considered.High risk individuals  in addition to risk reduction strategies, should be considered \nfor invasive coronary angiography with view to revascularization.\nLow risk individuals  can be managed in the general outpatient clinics with Family \nMedicine Specialists. Intermediate and high risk individuals should be referred to \ntertiary cardiac centers for further evaluation and revascularisation as indicated.\n8.1.4  Smoking Cessation\nSmoking is an independent risk factor for CVD.215\nIt also interacts with other CV risk factors, such as glucose intolerance and \nlow serum levels of HDL-C in a multiplicative manner215–217 Examples:\n  the presence of smoking alone is reported to double the level of risk, but  \n  the simultaneous presence of another major risk factor is estimated to  \n  quadruple the risk (2 × 2).215\n  the presence of two other risk factors with smoking may result in approx \n  imately eight times the risk (2 × 2 × 2) of persons with no risk factors.215\nSmoking is an important cause of plaque rupture leading to ACS.218 Data from \nthe NCVD-ACS Registry 2014-2015 showed that 37% of patients were smokers.\n30 In the INTERHEART study, a dose response relationship was \ndemonstrated between the number of cigarettes smoked and MI, where smokers who smoked >40 cig/day were found to have a 9-fold relative risk of \nMI compared with non-smokers.\n219\nChanging cigarette designs such as filtered, low-tar, and “light” variations, \nhave not reduced overall disease risk among smokers.215\nStopping smoking after an MI is the most effective prevention measure.215 \nThere is significant reduction on morbidity within the first 6 months of quitting and the risks of CVD almost equals the risk of never smokers after 10-15 \nyears of cessation.\n215\nPatients may be referred to the mQuit Services. Currently this smoking \ncessation service is being implemented both in government and private facilities including general practice clinics, private hospital and community \npharmacies.

MANAGEMENT (Fig 2, pg 25)\nThe treatment goals in stable CAD are to:\n  alleviate symptoms and improve quality of life,  reduce risk of adverse CV outcomes and improve survival and\n  prevent progression of atherosclerotic disease. \nOptimal Medical Therapy (OMT) is the cornerstone of management of \npatients with both obstructive and non-obstructive CAD.\n72,76,153,154 It has been \nshown to improve prognosis, reduce symptoms and myocardial ischemia.\n72,76,153,154\nOMT involves:  intensive lifestyle changes (healthy diet, regular physical activity,  \n  smoking cessation and optimal management of risk factors and weight)  \n  and\n  pharmacotherapy which includes: \n   anti-platelet agents and \n   statins to achieve target LDL-C.\nIn addition, ACEi, β-blockers and anti-anginal medications may be necessary \nto treat co-existing hypertension, LV dysfunction and/or angina.\n \nThe management of these patients with Stable CAD should be multifaceted and include:\n  behavioural modification therapy (BMT) - patient education and lifestyle  \n  modification and \n  pharmacological therapy and\n  myocardial revascularization when indicated.\nAll patients should be educated on behavioural modification therapy and \nreceive OMT for survival benefit. Treatment of CV risk factors to target and adherence to treatment recommendations should also be addressed.Table 9: Nutritional Recommendations\nWarfarin is indicated in patients with Stable CAD for:\n Valvular and non-valvular AF both paroxysmal and persistent.\n22,261,262\n LV thrombus - In patients with stable CAD and depressed LV function and  \n a LV thrombus demonstrated for the first time by echocardiography,  warfarin  \n for at least 6 months may be considered.High risk individuals  in addition to risk reduction strategies, should be considered \nfor invasive coronary angiography with view to revascularization.\nLow risk individuals  can be managed in the general outpatient clinics with Family \nMedicine Specialists. Intermediate and high risk individuals should be referred to \ntertiary cardiac centers for further evaluation and revascularisation as indicated.\n8.1.4  Smoking Cessation\nSmoking is an independent risk factor for CVD.215\nIt also interacts with other CV risk factors, such as glucose intolerance and \nlow serum levels of HDL-C in a multiplicative manner215–217 Examples:\n  the presence of smoking alone is reported to double the level of risk, but  \n  the simultaneous presence of another major risk factor is estimated to  \n  quadruple the risk (2 × 2).215\n  the presence of two other risk factors with smoking may result in approx \n  imately eight times the risk (2 × 2 × 2) of persons with no risk factors.215\nSmoking is an important cause of plaque rupture leading to ACS.218 Data from \nthe NCVD-ACS Registry 2014-2015 showed that 37% of patients were smokers.\n30 In the INTERHEART study, a dose response relationship was \ndemonstrated between the number of cigarettes smoked and MI, where smokers who smoked >40 cig/day were found to have a 9-fold relative risk of \nMI compared with non-smokers.\n219\nChanging cigarette designs such as filtered, low-tar, and “light” variations, \nhave not reduced overall disease risk among smokers.215\nStopping smoking after an MI is the most effective prevention measure.215 \nThere is significant reduction on morbidity within the first 6 months of quitting and the risks of CVD almost equals the risk of never smokers after 10-15 \nyears of cessation.\n215\nPatients may be referred to the mQuit Services. Currently this smoking \ncessation service is being implemented both in government and private facilities including general practice clinics, private hospital and community \npharmacies. More information is available at www.jomquit.moh.gov.my\nNon-smokers exposed to second-hand smoke increase their risk of developing:\n220\n  CHD by 25-30%.\n  stroke by 20-30%.\n  lung cancer by 20-30%.\nThere is no safe level of exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke.220E-cigarette aerosol (vaping) is harmful.221,222\n  The use of products containing nicotine poses dangers to youth,  pregnant  \n  women, and foetuses. \n  Nicotine exposure during adolescence can cause addiction and can  \n  harm the developing adolescent brain.\nThe use of e-cigarettes and shisha are not recommended.221,222\n8.1.5. Weight managementBoth overweight and obesity are associated with an increased risk of death in \nCAD. \nObesity increases the risk of:\n223–225\n  all-cause mortality by about 20%.\n  overall CV mortality by 50%. \n  CHD mortality by about 50% in women and about 60% in men.\nEvery 5 kg/m² higher BMI, was associated, on the average, with a 30% higher \noverall mortality and 40% increase for vascular mortality. 225 In morbid obesity \n(BMI ≥40 kg/m²) CV mortality is increased by 200% to 300%.226 The presence \nof sleep apnoea symptoms should be carefully assessed, especially in obese patients. Sleep apnoea has been associated with an increase in CV mortality \nand morbidity.\n227,228 \nWeight loss is a challenge and preventing weight regain after weight loss may \nbe even more difficult. Modest weight loss of between 5 to 10%, can reduce \nblood pressure (BP), improve glycaemic control, lipid profile, and quality of \nlife.229\nThe goals of weight management are to achieve 5 to 10% weight loss 229-234 \nand to maintain this over a period of 1-2 years before attempting further \nweight loss. \nMethods of weight loss include dietary intervention, increased physical \nactivity, behavioural modifications (e.g. self-monitoring of eating habits), pharmacological agents and bariatric surgery.Anti-obesity drugs that are available locally are:   Sympathomimetic (Phentermine) - this drug should not be used  \n  continuously for longer than 6 months at any one time.\n235,236\n  Lipase Inhibitor - Orlistat.237-239 \n  Glucagon-like peptide 1 Receptor Agonist - Liraglutide.240 \nThese drugs may be considered for overweight and obese people with: 22\n  BMI >25.0 kg/m2 plus 2 CV risk factors or \n  BMI ≥27.0 kg/m2 after failing to lose weight despite 6 months of lifestyle  \n  modification\nIn patients with morbid obesity, bariatric surgery may be considered.22,241, 245\n8.2.  Pharmacological therapy\nThe aims of pharmacological therapy in patients with both obstructive and \nnon-obstructive CAD are to:\n  prevent future CV events and  relieve symptoms of angina and improve quality of life.\n8.2.1. Prevention of future CV events\nThis is achieved by: \n  reducing the progression and possibly causing regression of the     coronary atherosclerotic plaque,   stabilizing the plaque and \n  preventing thrombosis in the event of plaque rupture.\n8.2.1.1. Antiplatelet agents and anticoagulantsA)  Antiplatelet agents\nIn patients with stable CAD, aspirin reduces the risk of non-fatal MI, non-fatal \nstroke and vascular death by 22%.\n246-248\nAspirin monotherapy at a dosing of 75-150  mg daily remains the initial                \nantiplatelet agent of choice.246-248 In patients who cannot tolerate aspirin, alternatives include:\n Clopidogrel249\n Ticlopidine - its use is limited by the scarcity of evidence on cardiac outcomes  \n and the associated risk of blood dyscrasias.250\n Triflusal - Triflusal is an antiaggregant related to the salicylate group. A  \n review did not find any difference between trifusal and aspirin in secondary  \n prevention of stroke or MI.251\nTicagrelor and prasugrel as monotherapy have not been studied in patients \nwith stable CAD. \nDual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) has been shown to reduce all-cause         \nmortality, MI and stroke post ACS whether this is managed medically, by PCI \nor surgically. The current recommendation is for DAPT for 12 months post \nACS.22,252,253\nFollowing an ACS, the risk of a recurrent cardiac event remains high.17-19,254 \nThis may be due to stent thrombosis (late, very late), in-stent restenosis \nand/or de novo lesions. \nThe use of DAPT (aspirin + thienopyridine) beyond one year has been shown \nto reduce additional ischemic events but the risk of bleeding is also increased.\n255–257 Similarly, in an extended >one year study of patients post \nACS, the use of aspirin in combination with ticagrelor was also associated \nwith a reduction in ischemic events but at the cost of an increased risk of \nbleeding.258\nThe use of DAPT beyond one year, in patients with stable CAD who have \nundergone PCI and stenting, has to be individualized weighing the risk of a recurrent ischemic event versus bleeding risks.\n22,253\nIn patients with high bleeding risk, the duration of DAPT post stenting can be shortened.\n259,260I, A   \nIIb, B\nIIb, B\nIIa, A\nIIa, B"

Intermediate and high risk individuals should be referred to \ntertiary cardiac centers for further evaluation and revascularisation as indicated.\n8.2.2.1.  β-blockers \nβ-blockers are suitable first-line agents to reduce the symptoms of angina. They act \nby competitively inhibiting catecholamines from binding to β1, β2 and β3 receptors, \nthus reducing heart rate, myocardial contractility and blood pressure. This results in \na decrease in myocardial oxygen demand.302 The prolongation of diastole also \nresults in improved coronary arterial filling.302 All these result in an improvement in \nsymptoms and exercise tolerance. \n \nβ-blockers have not been shown to reduce the rate of CV events or mortality in \npatients with stable CAD. A meta-analysis of trials done in post MI patients in the \npre-primary PCI era, showed that β-blockers reduced all-cause mortality and \nnonfatal MI.303 Current data however, have not shown β-blockers to reduce long term \nmortality if continued beyond 1-year post MI.304,305\nβ-blockers reduce all-cause mortality in individuals with reduced LV function, both \nischemic and non-ischemic heart failure.306 In these patients however, only \ncarvedilol, bisoprolol, long acting metoprolol and nebivolol have been shown to improve prognosis and CV outcomes.\n307-314\nAll β-blockers appear to be equally effective in treating stable CAD. However, \nnebivolol has not been studied in patients with angina or who have had a recent MI.\nIn diabetes, vasodilating β-blockers seem to have better metabolic profile since they \ncause less insulin resistance.315 Nebivolol, a β1 selective blocker, has a favourable \nmetabolic profile, improves insulin sensitivity and does not cause deleterious effects on lipid profile.\n316,317 Likewise, carvedilol, a non-selective β- and α1-blocker, \nmaintains glycaemic control, while improving insulin sensitivity.318\nSide-effects of β-blockers include hypotension, fatigue, bradycardia, heart block, bronchospasm, peripheral vasoconstriction, impotence, hypoglycaemia and            depression. β-blockers are contraindicated in patients with known conduction \ndisorders, cardiogenic shock and should be used with caution in patients with asthma.\n319\nβ-blockers can worsen symptoms in patients with vasospastic (Prinzmetal) angina and should therefore be avoided in these patients."

Calcium Channel Blockers (CCBs)\nCCBs dilate systemic arterioles and coronary arteries, resulting in reduced afterload \nand peripheral vascular resistance.320 Selective, non-competitive inhibition of \nvoltage-dependent L-type calcium channels lead to reduced myocardium contractility, smooth muscle relaxation and nodal inhibition leading to a slowing down of                \nconduction.\n320\nCCBs can be classified as:\n  dihydropyridines (DHPs) - amlodipine, felodipine, long-acting nifedipine. These  \n  have greater binding affinity to the calcium channels in vascular smooth muscle\n  non-DHPs - verapamil and diltiazem. These agents act mainly on the sinus  \n  node resulting in a reduction in the heart rate.  \nDHPs do not lower heart rate or reduce myocardial contractility. In addition to their \nanti-anginal effects, they are also effective in controlling co-existing hypertension. \nThe CCB-β-blocker combination is beneficial because the DHPs induced reflex \ntachycardia is blunted with the co-existing use of a β-blocker.25,321\nThe short-acting formulations of DHPs (short acting nifedipine) should be avoided in patients with CAD. Studies have shown that they increase the risk of MI while, at \nhigher doses, they increased mortality rates.\n322,323\nNon-DHPs such as verapamil and diltiazem are as efficacious as β-blockers as \nanti-anginal therapy and cause less symptoms of depression.25,324,325 However, the \nmultiple daily dosing of the immediate release formulations of the non-DHPs can \nresult in reduced adherence. Concurrent use of a non-DHP and a β-blocker, should \nbe used with caution because of the risk of bradycardia and heart block.326 They may \nalso be used cautiously in patients with LV dysfunction.\nCCBs are effective anti-anginal therapy but have not been shown to have any effect \non long term CV outcomes.327,328\n8.2.2.3.

        "text": "77\nStable Coronary Artery Disease 2018\n(2nd Edition)\n8.2.2.3.1. Nitrates for acute angina\nSublingual glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) can be given for immediate relief of angina. The \naerosol formulation has a faster onset of action. GTN improves exercise tolerance \nwhen given prophylactically, thus preventing anticipated angina caused by exertion. Besides its anti-anginal properties, GTN also has shown antithrombotic and \nantiplatelet activity.\n330,331\nGTN tablets should be kept in an amber coloured bottle and protected from sunlight. \nOnce the bottle has been opened, the life-span is reduced to 8 weeks. The aerosol formulation can be used until the expiry date.\n8.2.2.3.2. Nitrates for angina treatment and prophylaxis\nNitrates are often used with β-blockers or CCBs to prevent or reduce angina and \nincrease exercise tolerance in symptomatic patients. Isosorbide mononitrate (ISMN) \nhas similar efficacy as isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) but with a longer duration of action \nand a better side effect profile.\nLong-term regular use of nitrates without a nitrate-free or nitrate-low interval of about \n8-10 hours can lead to nitrate tolerance. This could offset the beneficial short-term \nischemic preconditioning effects and potentially worsen endothelial dysfunction.\n332,332 \nTwice daily dosing of ISDN that provides a 10-12-hour nitrate-free interval each day is preferred. \nThe most common side effect of nitrates is headache. It may also cause hypotension. \nConcurrent use with a phosphodiesterase type-5 (PDE5) inhibitor like sildenafil is \ncontraindicated because of severe hypotension. \n8.2.2.4. Ivabradine (I\nf inhibitor)\nAn elevated heart rate is associated with an increase in both all-cause as well as CV \nmortality.334–337 This relationship is independent of other risk markers. Decreasing \nheart rate can lead to an improvement in angina by reducing myocardial oxygen \nconsumption and by increasing diastolic perfusion time.302\nIvabradine is a selective inhibitor of the sinus node I f ion current (‘funny current’). It \nis negatively chronotropic (slows heart rate), thereby decreasing myocardial oxygen \ndemand with no effect on myocardial contractility or systemic blood pressure.338,339Ivabradine has been shown to improve symptoms and reduce CV hospitalization, fatal and non-fatal MI and the need for coronary revascularization in patients with \nstable CAD, moderate LV dysfunction and HR >70 bpm.\n340-344\nIvabradine may be considered for symptomatic treatment of stable CAD in patients with normal sinus rhythm, especially in those who have a contraindication to or \nintolerance to β-blockers. It may also be used in combination with β-blockers in \npatients with high resting heart rates.\n344-347 The dose should be decreased or            \ndiscontinued if HR remains below 50bpm.\nIvabradine is not suitable for patients who are in atrial fibrillation. Its use with \nrate-limiting non-DHPs should be avoided because of the QT prolonging effect.348 \nSide-effects include bradycardia and reversible visual disturbances.338 There is no \nsignificant interaction with most other cardiac drugs e.g. ACEis, ARBs, warfarin, \namiodarone, anti-platelet agents, cholesterol lowing agents, digoxin and diuretics.\n8.2.2.5.

Compared to persons with no apparent coronary lesions (<20% luminal narrowing), non-obstructive CHD (≥20% and <50% luminal narrowing) \nwas associated with significantly higher risk of MI and all-cause mortality in both \ngender.\n461,463\nThe WISE study showed that the 5-year cardiac event rate for MI and CVD death were significantly different (P ≤0.002) in the 3 subgroups:\n464\n  16% for women with angina and non-obstructive CAD (stenosis <50%)\n  7.9% for women with angina and normal coronary arteries (Cardiac Syndrome X)\n  2.4% for the asymptomatic control group \nWomen with non-obstructive CAD and documented myocardial ischemia have a \npoorer prognosis.34,465 Women with Syndrome X and severe endothelial dysfunction \nhave a 30% increased risk of developing CAD at 10 years.464,466-468\nParadoxically, women tend to have lower prevalence of obstructive coronary disease but more symptoms, ischemia and adverse outcomes.\n459,469 It has been postulated that this could be due to abnormal coronary vasomotor reactivity, \nmicrovascular dysfunction, distal coronary erosion/embolization and non-obstructive \ncoronary disease. 459,470 \nData seems to suggest that the adverse outcomes seen in women could be due to \ntheir baseline risk and clinical characteristics rather than to gender dependent \nfactors or to bias in therapies.471\n10.2.1.   Diagnosis of CAD in women\nThe diagnosis of angina in women is more difficult for the following reasons:\n  Atypical chest pain and angina-equivalent symptoms such as dyspnoea are  \n  more common in women.\n  Correlation between symptoms and 'significant' luminal obstruction at coronary  \n  angiography is weaker in women.  Angina with demonstrable myocardial ischaemia may be present in the presence  \n  of normal coronaries or minor atherosclerotic disease. \nIn the non-invasive evaluation of women with chest pain, exercise stress ECG is the \nfirst test of choice in women with good exercise capacity and a normal resting ECG. Exercise stress ECG have higher false positive rates in women than in men. The \nsensitivity is 31-71% and specificity is about 66 to 78% in women and about 80% for \nboth in men.\n66,472,473\nDespite these limitations, a normal exercise stress ECG at adequate workloads in women with intermediate probability of CAD is a good indication that there is no \nsignificant obstructive lesion.\n66,471 An exercise ECG stress test, however, does not \ndetect myocardial ischemia in women with non-obstructive coronary lesions. \nDue to the limitations of exercise ECG stress testing, stress echocardiography \n(exercise or dobutamine) and stress SPECT have been recommended in women. Both these tests can detect myocardial ischemia in the presence of obstructive and \nnon-obstructive coronary lesions.\n66 These tests also have higher specificity.473 The \ndiagnostic accuracy of SPECT however, can be reduced in women by both breast \ntissue and obesity, especially in the anterior myocardial segments, resulting in \nfalse-positives.\nCardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) is a newer imaging tool to investigate CAD in \nwomen. A negative stress CMR study is associated with very low risk of CV death and MI.\n474"

Women tend to present at an older \nage and therefore have higher morbidity and mortality after an MI, PCI and CABG.455 \nFor more details please refer to CPG Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease in \nWomen, 2nd Ed.455\n10.3.    Elderly \nIn the elderly, often defined as >75 years of age, there is equal prevalence of CAD \nin both gender.475\nIn this age group, complaints of chest discomfort, weakness and dyspnoea are \ncommon, and evaluation of chest pain can be difficult. This may be further compounded when some of the elderly have difficulties expressing their symptoms \ndue to dysphasia or cognition issues. Comorbidities that can mimic stable CAD are \ncommon (e.g. gastroesophageal reflux disease, musculoskeletal pain). The elderly \nare usually undertreated and under-represented in clinical trials and most of the available knowledge is derived from sub analyses of main trials or retrospective studies. \n10.3.1. Diagnostic testing in the elderly\nDiagnostic testing in the elderly may be problematic. Exercise stress testing is often \ndifficult due to muscle weakness and deconditioning and osteoarthritis of the knees. \nLess challenging exercise stress protocols or pharmacological stress imaging such \nas DSE may be appropriate.\n476\nThe specificity of test results is often reduced because of a higher rate of false positive results due to abnormal resting ECG and a higher prevalence of                  confounders including prior Ml, conduction disturbances, hypertension and left \nventricular hypertrophy. At the same time a negative test may be a false negative in \na population with high prevalence of disease. Arrhythmias are also more common at higher exercise workloads.\n477 \nCTA may not be suitable in the elderly because of the presence of coronary             \ncalcification making visualization of the lumen difficult.\nElderly patients with objective evidence of moderate to severe ischemia on            \nnon-invasive testing or with troubling angina despite OMT, should have similar"
