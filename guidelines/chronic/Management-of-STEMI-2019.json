Rapid developments have taken place, especially in the area of \npre-hospital care. This 4th edition was developed to provide a clear and concise \napproach based on current evidence with the focus being on efforts to reduce \nthe time from first medical contact, improve pre-hospital care as well support the \napplication of guideline-directed therapies. \nThis CPG has been prepared by a panel of committee members from the National \nHeart Association of Malaysia (NHAM) and Ministry of Health (MOH). The committee \nmembers were multidisciplinary and comprised of cardiologists, internal medicine, \nfamily medicine, rehabilitation and emergency physicians from the government, \nprivate sector and universities. Relevant clinical trial data and published literature \nhave been summarized and adapted to local practices. This guideline also \nimplemented the work of our very own national STEMI network which links non-PCI-\ncapable centres to PCI-capable centres so PCI services can be arranged in a timely \nmanner for all patients.\nIschaemic heart disease has been a significant burden to this country, and it \nis projected that the burden will continue to increase with the rising number of \ncardiovascular risk factors and an ageing population. I believe this CPG will be an \ninvaluable guiding document for healthcare providers involved in the management of \nSTEMI and subsequently be translated to an improved clinical outcome for patients \nsuffering from ischaemic heart disease.\nDATUK DR NOOR HISHAM ABDULLAH\nDIRECTOR GENERAL OF HEALTH OF MALAYSIA"

With timely intervention and early reperfusion, the \ncardiovascular outcomes have improved. The biggest challenge has been to reduce \nthe total ischaemic time, which is the time from onset of chest pain till the time when \nthe infarct related artery is opened. A large portion of this delay has been the late \npresentation of the patient with AMI to medical attention (onset of chest pain to First \nMedical Contact – FMC).\nThe 1st Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) on ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction \n(STEMI) was published in 2001 with a 2nd and 3rd update in 2007 and 2014 \nrespectively. Rapid further developments have taken place especially in the area \nof pre-hospital care. This 4th edition was developed to provide a clear and concise \napproach based on current evidence with the focus being on efforts to reduce time \nto FMC and improve pre-hospital care. We have summarised and adapted relevant \nclinical trial data and published literature to the local practice.\nThis CPG has been prepared by a panel of committee members from the National \nHeart Association of Malaysia (NHAM) and Ministry of Health (MOH). The committee \nmembers were multidisciplinary and comprised of cardiologists, internal medicine, \nfamily medicine, rehabilitation and emergency physicians from the government, \nprivate sector and universities. The external reviewers were also multidisciplinary \nand in addition to specialists, general practitioners were also included. Patient and \ncarer groups were however not included as external reviewers.\nObjectives\nThese guidelines are intended to provide awareness and education in order to \nreduce the morbidity and mortality associated with STEMI by:\n• Reducing total ischaemic time\n• Developing a network for early referral and treatment of STEMI patients\n• Updating the management of STEMI with respect to:\n Diagnosis\n Management\n Secondary prevention"

Literature search was carried out using the \nfollowing electronic databases – PubMed and Cochrane Database of Systematic \nReviews. The search was conducted for the period 1st September 2013 till 31st \nAugust 2018. The following MeSH terms or free text terms were used either singly \nor in combination:\n“Myocardial infarction (MI)”; “STEMI”; ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction;” “definition \nof MI”; “Myocardial injury”, “ECG criteria of STEMI”, “Pre-hospital Management \nof STEMI”; “STEMI Networks”; “Pre-hospital thrombolysis”; “Fibrinolysis”; \n“Primary PCI”; “Reperfusion strategies in STEMI”; “Pharmaco-invasive strategy”; \n“Pharmacotherapy in STEMI”; “Oxygen therapy in MI”; “Complications post STEMI”, \n“cardiogenic shock”; “Heart Failure post STEMI”; “Risk stratification scores in \nSTEMI”; “Cardiac rehabilitation”, “second prevention post STEMI”, “management of \nSTEMI in women, the elderly, persons with diabetes and in those with chronic renal \ndisease.”\nThe search was filtered to clinical trials and reviews, involving humans and published \nin the English language. The relevant articles were carefully selected from this huge \nlist. In addition, the reference lists of all relevant articles retrieved were searched to \nidentify further studies. Local CPGs were also studied. Experts in the field were also \ncontacted to obtain further information. International guidelines mainly that from the \nAmerican Heart Association/ American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) and the \nEuropean Society of Cardiology (ESC) were used as main references. \nAll literature retrieved were appraised by members of the Expert Panel and all \nstatements and recommendations made were collectively agreed by the group. The \ngrading of evidence and the level of recommendation used in this CPG was adapted \nfrom the AHA/ACC and the ESC (pg 14).\nAfter much discussion, the draft was then drawn up and submitted to the Technical \nAdvisory Committee for Clinical Practice Guidelines, MOH Malaysia and key health \npersonnel in the major hospitals of the MOH and the private sector for review and \nfeedback."

Clinical history consistent with chest pain of ischaemic origin.\nii. New ischaemic ECG changes or development of pathological Q waves.\niii. Imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall \nmotion abnormality.\niv. Identification of an intracoronary (IC) thrombus by angiography or autopsy.\n• MI may be due to STEMI or Non ST Elevation Acute Coronary Syndrome (NSTE-\nACS).\n• STEMI is diagnosed when there is:\n ST elevation of ≥1 mm in 2 contiguous leads or \n a new onset LBBB in the resting ECG\n in a patient with ischaemic type chest pains of > 30 minutes and \n accompanied by a rise and fall in cardiac biomarkers. (Table 6, pg 48 for ECG \ndiagnosis of STEMI) \n• New onset Right Bundle Branch Block with ST elevation of ≥1 mm in 2 contiguous \nleads does not interfere with the diagnosis of STEMI. \n• Patients having prolonged ischaemic type chest pain of > 30 minutes and having:\n a normal ECG or ST segment depression may be having NSTE-ACS.

INTRODUCTION\nThe most recent data from the National Department of Statistics Malaysia indicated \nthat in 2014, ischaemic heart disease (IHD) was the principal cause of mortality \n(13.7%). For men, it was the principle cause of death (15.2%) and for women, it was \nsecond after pneumonias.1\nMost deaths in STEMI occur within the first hour due to fatal arrhythmias. In addition, \nTIME LOST IS MYOCARDIUM LOST .  Thus, early diagnosis and prompt reperfusion \nis important. \nBased on the latest Malaysian Annual Report of the National Cardiovascular \nDatabase- Acute Coronary Syndrome (NCVD-ACS) Registry 2014-2015 it was noted \nthat:2 \n• The demographics of patients with Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) have not \nchanged over the last 10 years. \n They are young with a mean age of 58.6 years, and about a quarter are below \nthe age of 50 years. This age is lower than that seen in Thailand, Singapore and \nin Western populations.3-5 The patients presenting with ST segment Elevation \nMyocardial Infarction (STEMI) are even younger with a mean age of 56 years. \n Majority of men presented with STEMI (50.5%) whereas women presented with \nNon ST Elevation Acute Coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) (70.8%). NSTE-ACS \nencompasses both Unstable Angina (UA)  and Non ST-Elevation Myocardial \nInfarction (NSTEMI).\n There was a high prevalence of hypertension, dyslipidaemia and diabetes – the \nprevalence of these risk factors has not changed over the last 10 years. \n• The in-hospital mortality following STEMI was 10.6% and that following NSTE-\nACS was 8.0%. \n• The STEMI patients were generally more ill. \nh 67.4% were in the intermediate-high TIMI risk score. \nh 19.0% were in Killip class III/IV. \n• Fibrinolytic therapy was the most common mode of reperfusion (69.1%), and only \n13.7% were treated with primary PCI. Even in PCI capable centres, only 16.4% \nof STEMI patients underwent Primary PCI. About 14% of patients did not receive \nany form of reperfusion treatment due to late presentation, missed and delayed \ndiagnosis. \n The median door-to-needle time (DNT) was 45 minutes and only 35.2% \nachieved the recommended DNT time of < 30 minutes. However, as a Key \nPerformance Indicator for the Emergency Department (ED) the DNT of < 30 \nmins was achieved in 87.1% of patients diagnosed with STEMI at presentation.6"

About 69.0% and 56.1% were on ß-blockers and Angiotensin \nConverting Enzyme Inhibitors (ACE- I)/ Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARB) upon \ndischarge.\n• The in-hospital, 30-day and 1-year mortality following STEMI remains high \nat 10.6%, 12.3% and 17.9% respectively. This in-hospital mortality is almost \ndouble that reported in the ACTION (Acute Coronary Treatment and Intervention \nOutcomes Network) Registry-GWTG (Get With the Guidelines) database in the \nUnited States for the period January 2012 to December 2013 which was only \n4.6%.7\n• Patients receiving reperfusion therapy (PCI or fibrinolytic) had overall better \nsurvival than those who did not receive any form of reperfusion. \n• Patients who underwent PCI during the index hospitalisation did better irrespective \nof it being primary PCI, rescue PCI, as part of pharmaco-invasive therapy or \ndelayed PCI.

DEFINITION AND PATHOGENESIS OF MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION    \nAcute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) is a clinical spectrum of Coronary Artery Disease \n(CAD) ranging from Unstable Angina (UA), non-ST segment Elevation Myocardial \nInfarction (NSTEMI) to STEMI depending upon the degree and acuteness of \ncoronary occlusion (Figure 1, pg 43). In UA, myocardial injury is absent and cardiac \nbiomarkers are normal. In myocardial injury, cardiac biomarkers are raised.\nIt is important to distinguish between myocardial injury and myocardial infarction \n(MI). Myocardial injury may be due to:10\n• ischaemia and/or \n• non-ischaemic causes (eg myocarditis, renal failure) \nMI is myocardial injury due to ischaemia.10 It is defined pathologically as myocardial \ncell death due to prolonged ischaemia.10 \nThe preferred cardiac biomarkers are the troponins (both I and T). Elevation of \ncardiac troponins indicates myocardial necrosis. A level above the 99th percentile \nof the URL is abnormal and indicative of myocardial injury.10 All locally available \ncommercial assays indicate this level, the exact value varying depending on the \nreagents used. The point of care kits, however, although giving a more rapid result, \nare not sensitive enough to detect this low level.  \nTroponins should always be interpreted in the clinical setting. Many troponin \nelevations, especially below certain cut-off points and troponin elevations without a \nrise and fall, are myocardial injuries and not MI. \nA rise and/or fall in the troponin level is indicative of acute injury, while a persistently \nelevated level is indicative of chronic injury.10 \nMI is diagnosed when there is a rise and/or fall in cardiac troponins, with at least \none value above the 99th percentile of the URL, and accompanied with at least one  \nof the following:\ni. Clinical history consistent with chest pain of ischaemic origin of > 30 minutes.\nii. ECG changes of ischaemia/infarction and/or the development of pathological Q \nwaves.\niii. Imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion \nabnormality.\niv. Identification of an intracoronary (IC) thrombus by angiography or autopsy.\nMI may be STEMI  or NSTE-ACS  based on the ECG. (Figure 1, pg 43)"

Occasionally the other types of MI may also present as STEMI.\n‘Reinfarction’ is used for MI that occurs within 28 days of the incident event (incident \nMI) while recurrent MI occurs after 28 days.11"

In these patients, often the myocardium involved is small and \nthe prognosis is not that bad.14 \nGenerally, patients with new onset Bundle Branch Block (BBB) have more \ncomorbidities and a worse prognosis.15,16\nIn the early stages of MI, the initial ECG may be normal, equivocal or show hyperacute \nT-wave changes only. In these patients, if the index of suspicion of STEMI is high, \nthe ECG should be repeated at close intervals of at least 15 minutes to look for \nprogressive ST changes. Comparison with previous ECGs may also be helpful. In \naddition, there are some conditions with ECG changes that can mimic that of STEMI. \n(Appendix I, pg 118)\nPatients with inferior STEMI should have an ECG recording of the right precordial \nlead (V4R) to identify concomitant right ventricular (RV) involvement.17,18 The cut-off \npoint is ≥ 0.5 mm (≥ 1 mm in men < 30 years old).10\nIn those with ST segment depression in leads V1-V3, it is advisable to have an ECG \nrecording of the posterior chest wall (V7-V9) to identify a true infero-basal (formerly \nknown as infero-posterior) STEMI.19 The cut-off point for ST segment elevation in the \nposterior leads is ≥ 0.05 mV (≥ 0.1 mV in men < 40 years).10 \nST elevation of > 1mm in lead aVR may accompany anterior or inferior STEMI.

PRE-HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT\nPublic awareness about heart disease should be increased so that individuals will \nseek appropriate treatment early, thus reducing time from symptom onset to FMC. \nMost deaths following STEMI occur in the pre-hospital phase. \nPatients with ischaemic-type chest pain should go to the nearest hospital rather \nthan a clinic.\nIn STEMI, it is important to reduce total ischaemic time i.e. the time from symptom \nonset to the time of institution of reperfusion strategies. Total ischaemic time is a \ncombination of:\n1. Time from arterial occlusion to symptom onset.\n2. Time from symptom onset to FMC.\n3. FMC to initiation of reperfusion strategies (Primary PCI or fibrinolysis).\nThe public should be educated about:\n• Symptoms of ACS.\n•  The importance of seeking early treatment at the nearest hospital. \n•  The benefits of early treatment – opening the blocked coronary artery as soon as \npossible to limit myocardial damage to the minimum and preserve heart function. \n“TIME IS MYOCARDIUM.”\nImmediate measures to be taken in suspected cases of ACS.\n4.1. For the general public\n• Seek immediate medical attention at the nearest hospital.\n• Call for an ambulance (dial 999) or get someone to take you immediately and \ndirectly to the nearest hospital. \n• Do not drive yourself. \n• If not on regular aspirin and with no history of allergy, chew 300mg aspirin \nimmediately.

Tachyarrhythmias \n• Pulseless ventricular tachyarrhythmias \nThis is either pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF). \nDefibrillate immediately. Early VF occurs within the first 48 hours and is due to \nelectrical instability. Late VF is associated with large infarcts and poor pump \nfunction and carries a poor prognosis (refer to algorithm 1, page 114).\n• Ventricular tachycardia (VT)\nVT in the setting of STEMI may arise from either ischaemia (usually within 48 hours) \nor from a myocardial scar due to the infarct (late onset). Treatment of ischaemia \nmay result in the termination of the tachycardia (refer to algorithm 2, page 115). \n• Ventricular premature contractions (VPC) \nThese are often benign and do not require treatment. Correct underlying ischaemia, \nhypoxia and electrolyte disturbances. \n• Accelerated idioventricular rhythm\nThese do not require any treatment. This is a sign suggestive of successful \nreperfusion.\n• Atrial fibrillation (AF)\nThis is more commonly seen in the elderly and is associated with large infarcts. \nIt denotes a poorer prognosis and carries an increased risk of thromboembolism \n(refer to algorithm 3, page 116).\nB.

The Melbourne \nRegistry showed that only 54% of patients stopped smoking by 30 days.330 Almost \n23% of those who quit smoking at 30 days had relapsed at 12 months highlighting \nthe difficulty of long-term abstinence.330,332  \nHospitalisation for an acute cardiovascular event provides a unique window of \nopportunity to encourage patients to quit smoking. A study has shown that the \nmajority of successful quitters at 1 year stopped immediately after their ACS.333\nHowever, smoking-cessation therapy in hospitalised patients offers challenges. \nThe duration of hospitalisation for acute myocardial infarction is usually brief and \nhospital stay is busy, making it difficult to gain the patient’s full attention for smoking-\ncessation counselling. Nevertheless, effective counselling in the hospital should be \nprovided for all smokers, and not just the minority who are ready to quit.334 Effective \ntransition from inpatient to outpatient smoking cessation treatment should take \nplace, with a minimum of 1-month follow-up.334 MQuit (Quit smoking) Services is \ncurrently available in all health clinics (Klinik Kesihatan) throughout the country. \n13.1.1.2   Pharmacotherapy\nPost-STEMI patients usually have been chronic smokers and most of them would \nhave high degree of nicotine dependency. Thus, they should be given personalised \nsmoking cessation medication intended to relieve withdrawal symptoms and to \nsupport long-term cessation.\nHowever, very low rates of these medications are prescribed post-MI, and this rate \nhas declined over time.335 Some clinicians are hesitant to add a smoking-cessation \nmedication on top of a number of other medications that have been initiated or \ncontinued. All smoking cessation interventions (nicotine replacement therapy, \nvarenicline and bupropion) have been shown to be safe in cardiac patients.336,337 \nFor further details of smoking cessation, please refer to the Malaysian Clinical \nPractice Guidelines on Primary and Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular \nDisease, 1st Ed, 2017.338\n   \n13.1.2 Diet and Weight Control\nCurrent guidelines on secondary CV prevention recommend:338,339\n• A diet similar to the Mediterranean diet, which includes a maximum of 10% \nof total energy intake from saturated fat, replacing it wherever possible with"

SPECIAL GROUPS\n14.1 STEMI in Older Individuals\nPatients above the age of 75 years have much higher in-hospital as well as 1-year \nmortality.364-367 This may be explained by their atypical and delayed presentations, \nmultiple co-morbidities and under-utilisation of reperfusion strategies.368,369 Diagnosis \nmay be delayed because of:\n• Atypical symptoms such as dyspnoea, syncope and acute delirium and confusion \nin the presence of pre-existing cognitive impairment.365,366 \n• Non-diagnostic and difficult to interpret ECGs complicated by an abnormal \nbaseline. \n• Non-diagnostic cardiac biomarkers.

Therefore, the risk-benefit ratio \nof each intervention should be individualised so that these patients are not excluded \nfrom interventions.373 It is important to assess frailty, general health and functional \nstatus, co-morbidities as well as the particular wishes of the patient and family.\nIn addition, age related differences in physiology can affect disease manifestation, \nbleeding risks, drug metabolism and management. Most MI’s in older patients \nare NSTEMI rather than STEMI.374 Older patients are more likely to develop left \nventricular failure (more than 50% of those aged > 75 years of age) and more than \n>10% develop cardiogenic shock.374,375 This is due to their more extensive disease, \nlate presentation, and age-related changes in cardiac physiology or decreased \nvascular compliance, ventricular hypertrophy and remodeling.375,376\n \nCKD is common in these patients and may increase the risk of bleeding.375,376 Most \ndrugs are excreted by the kidneys and doses need to be adjusted. Creatinine \nclearance (CrCL) should be estimated using the Cockcroft-Gault and the estimated \nglomerular filtration rate (eGFR) by the CKD-EPI (Chronic Kidney Disease \nEpidemiology Collaboration) equations or Modification of Diet in Renal Disease \n(MDRD) equations. (Appendix VI, pg 124).\nIn the management of STEMI in older patients: \n• Primary PCI  - this is the preferred reperfusion strategy if facilities are available \nand the patient is eligible for PCI.376-381 Procedural success is highly variable. Older \npatients are more likely to have PCI related complications especially bleeding.382 \n• Fibrinolytic therapy  - there is an increased risk of intracranial haemorrhage in \nolder patients and the risks of bleeding have to be carefully considered in those \nolder than 75 years.383--386 The dose of tenecteplase is 50% of the recommended \ndose in those ≥ 75 years of age.387\n• Adjunctive therapy  - when compared with younger patients, older patients \nhave a greater absolute reduction with most evidence based medications.365 It is \nimportant to balance the risks of polypharmacy and the risks of drug interactions \nwith the benefit of not withholding guideline-directed medications, proven to be \nof benefit in these older individuals.

Women however, have higher \nearly all-cause and cardiac mortality after primary PCI and they also have higher \nbleeding risk.434 Women are less likely to undergo coronary angiography and \nreperfusion and those who underwent primary PCI tend to have longer DBT.434\n• Women given fibrinolytics [recombinant tissue plasminogen activators (r-TPA)] \nhad a higher incidence but lower mortality from bleeding than men.442 \n• Adjunctive therapy is similar in both gender.443-445 Women however have higher \nbleeding risk.\n• Cardiac rehabilitation – women, especially older women, are under-referred for \ncardiac rehabilitation.446,447 Efforts should be initiated to overcome these barriers.448\n• Continuing HRT after STEMI does not confer a benefit nor pose a worrisome \nincrease in risk. When considering the need for HRT for menopausal symptoms, \nclinical judgement is necessary.449,450\nKey messages #12:\n• Diagnosis of STEMI in the elderly, diabetics and women is difficult and a high \nindex of suspicion is important.\n• Treatment is the same although the elderly and women tend to have higher \nbleeding risk."

Small studies \nseem to indicate that Troponin I may be more specific for myocardial necrosis than \nTroponin T in CKD.463 \nManagement\nReperfusion Strategy:\nThe optimal mode of reperfusion in patients with CKD presenting with STEMI has not \nbeen addressed in large prospective trials. The best strategy in patients with severe \nCKD and those on dialysis is still unclear.464-468 Registry data seem to indicate that \nthe benefits of reperfusion is uncertain in this population.464-469\nIn patients receiving fibrinolytics, there are no dose adjustment recommendations \nfor the use of streptokinase, alteplase, reteplase, or tenecteplase in patients with \nCKD. However, the risk of intracranial haemorrhage is increased.470\nThe success rate of emergency PCI in patients with CKD is generally lower and \ncan result in worsening renal function due to haemodynamic instability and CIN.471 \nPatients with CKD tend to have more extensive atherosclerosis and more complex \ncalcified lesions.471 In some patients with multivessel coronary involvement and \nhaemodynamic instability, complete revascularization by CABG may be superior to \nPCI."
