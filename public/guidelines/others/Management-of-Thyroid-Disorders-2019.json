        "text": "CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES \nMANAGEMENT OF THYROID DISORDERS1KEY RECOMMENDATIONS\nThe following recommendations were highlighted by the guidelines Development \nGroup as the key clinical recommendations that should be prioritised for implementation. \nHYPERTHYROIDISM\n• In patients with suspected hyperthyroidism, serum TSH and fT4 should \nbe obtained at the initial evaluation. fT3 should be measured when TSH is suppressed but fT4 is within normal range. \n• Patients with overt Graves’ hyperthyroidism should be treated with any of the following modalities: ATDs, RAI therapy, or thyroidectomy.\n• If ATD is chosen as the primary therapy for GD, the medication should be continued for approximately 12–18 months, and then discontinued if the TSH levels are normal at that time.\n• If surgery is chosen as the primary therapy for GD, near total or total thyroidectomy is the procedure of choice and should be referred to a high-volume thyroid surgeon. \n• Patients with overtly TMNG or TA should be treated with RAI therapy or thyroidectomy. On occasion, long-term, low-dose treatment with MMI may be appropriate. \n• A differential WBC count should be obtained during febrile illness and at the onset of pharyngitis in all patients taking antithyroid medication. \n• Liver function and hepatocellular integrity should be assessed in patients taking \nMMI or PTU who experience pruritic rash, jaundice, light-coloured stool or dark \nurine, joint pain, abdominal pain or bloating, anorexia, nausea, or fatigue. \nHYPOTHYROIDISM\n• Levothyroxine is the recommended preparation of choice and the mainstay of \ntreatment of hypothyroidism. \nThe three main aims of therapy are: \n i)   To provide resolution of signs and symptoms, including biological and \nphysiological markers of hypothyroidism \n ii)   To achieve normalisation of serum TSH with improvement in thyroid \nhormone concentrations \n iii)  To avoid iatrogenic thyrotoxicosis or overtreatment particularly in the elderly \n• Levothyroxine is best taken on empty stomach (1 hour before breakfast or at bedtime, at least 3 hours after the last meal of the day) because absorption is impaired if taken with food. Compliance may be enhanced however, by instructing patients to consistently take it before breakfast each day."

        "text": "CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES \nMANAGEMENT OF THYROID DISORDERS2• Levothyroxine replacement therapy can be started as an initial full replacement \nor as partial replacement with gradual dose increments titrated using serum TSH as the goal. Dose adjustments should be made when there are significant \nchanges in body weight, and with pregnancy and ageing. Serum TSH should be \nreassessed 4–8 weeks after any dose adjustments. \nSUBCLINICAL THYROID DISORDERS\n• When TSH is persistently <0.1 mIU/L, treatment of SCHyper is recommended in \nall individuals >65 years of age.\n• Antithyroid drugs should be the first line and initial treatment for subclinical \nhyperthyroidism, whatever the aetiology.\n• Radioactive iodine therapy should be considered in those with persistent \nand progressive subclinical hyperthyroidism due to autonomous nodule and \nmultinodular goitre.\n• Investigation of raised TSH requires repeated measurements to establish a firm \ndiagnosis of subclinical hypothyroidism.\nTHYROID NODULES/GOITRE\n• All patients with a suspected thyroid nodule/nodular goitre or radiographic \nabnormality suggesting a thyroid nodule incidentally detected on another imaging study should undergo a dedicated thyroid/neck US that encompasses \nthe thyroid as well as the central and lateral neck compartments.\n• Surgery is recommended in:\n i. symptomatic compression or large goitres (>80 g)\n ii. relatively low uptake of RAI\n iii.  when thyroid malignancy is documented or suspected (e.g. suspicious or \nindeterminate cytology)\n iv.  large thyroid nodules, especially if greater than 4 cm or if nonfunctioning, or hypofunctioning on \n123I or 99mTc pertechnetate scanning\n v. coexisting hyperparathyroidism requiring surgery\n vi. especially if TRAb levels are particularly high\n vii. patients with moderate-to–severe active Graves’ Ophthalmopathy (GO)\n• Surgery is not recommended for patients with substantial comorbidity such as cardiopulmonary disease, end-stage cancer, or other debilitating disorders, or \nwhere there is lack of access to a high-volume thyroid surgeon. \n• Subacute thyroiditis should be suspected in all patients who present with painful \ngoitre."

        "text": "CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES \nMANAGEMENT OF THYROID DISORDERS3THYROID EMERGENCIES\nThyroid Storm\n• The diagnosis of thyroid storm is clinical. Both the BWPS and JTA diagnostic tools \ncould be used to aid diagnosis, but we recommend the use of BWPS as this scoring tool is more sensitive. \n• High doses of PTU (500–1000 mg loading, then 250 mg, 4–6 hourly) should be used in thyroid storm. In the presence of contraindications, high doses of MMI (60–80 mg/day) can be used. \n• b-adrenergic receptor antagonists such as propranolol should be administered in thyroid storm to control heart rate and inhibit other peripheral action of thyroid hormone. \n• Shorter acting intravenous esmolol or diltiazem can be used to control heart rate when there are contraindications to b-adrenergeic receptor antagonists. \n• High doses of glucocorticoids (IV hydrocortisone 100 mg, 6 hourly or \ndexamethasone 2 mg, 6 hourly) should be given in thyroid storm. \n• 5–10 drops of Lugols iodine 6–8 hourly for the first 10 days, should be given after \nadministration of antithyroid drugs for rapid improvement of thyrotoxicosis in \nthyroid storm. \n• All patients with thyroid storm should have early definitive therapy with RAI. \nIn patients with large obstructing goitre or contraindications to RAI, early \nthyroidectomy should be considered instead. \nMyxoedema Coma\n• Intravenous hydrocortisone 200 mg start then 100 mg 6–8 hourly should be \nadministered prior to levothyroxine. \n• Initial intravenous levothyroxine of 200–400 mg followed by 1.6 mcg/kg/day \n(75% if administered intravenously) should be given thereafter. If intravenous levothyroxine is not available, oral levothyroxine can be given as 500 mcg loading \nfollowed by maintenance dose. \n• Intravenous liothyronine (when available) may be given in addition to thyroxine. \nLoading dose recommended is 5–20 mcg followed by 2.5–10 mcg every 8 hours \ntill patient regains consciousness. \nPre-/Perioperative Management\n• All elective surgery should be postponed until euthyroidism or near euthyroid \nstate is achieved. \n• In patients who are hyperthyroid and require urgent surgery, rapid control \nwith high dose MMI or PTU, b-blockers, Lugol’s iodine and glucocorticoids are \nrecommended."

Graves’ disease is differentiated from gestational thyrotoxicosis clinically. TRAb supports the diagnosis of Graves’ disease.\n• Management of gestational transient thyrotoxicosis is mainly through \nsupportive therapy: rehydration and hospitalisation if needed in the presence of \nhyperemesis gravidarum; and b-blocker if very symptomatic. Antithyroid drug is not recommended. \n• In pregnant women in whom ATD needs to be continued; PTU is recommended throughout the first trimester.\n• The lowest effective dose of ATD should be used for thyrotoxicosis during \npregnancy, targeting fT4 at or moderately above the reference range. \n• In postpartum thyroiditis\n -  Women in thyrotoxic phase of PPT who are symptomatic should be treated \nwith b-blockers; ATDs are not recommended.\n -  Women in hypothyroid phase of PPT and who are symptomatic should be treated with thyroxine. Women with mild symptoms who choose not to be \ntreated need to have their TFT checked every 4–8 weekly until euthyroidism \nis restored."

        "text": "CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES \nMANAGEMENT OF THYROID DISORDERS5ACQUIRED HYPOTHYROIDISM AND HYPERTHYROIDISM IN CHILDREN AND \nADOLESCENTS\n• Hypothyroidism secondary to Hashimoto’s thyroiditis: Levothyroxine is \nrecommended as the medication of choice with the recommended dose is \nbased on the body weight or body surface area. The recommended target range for TSH is in the lower half of the reference range while for free T4 is in the upper half of the reference range. Levothyroxine is effective in reducing the thyroid gland size/goitre.\n•  Non-goitrous euthyroid Hashimoto’s thyroiditis:  One should monitor for goitre, \nantithyroid antibodies and pattern of thyroid function; treatment with thyroxine is controversial.\n•  Hyperthyroidism:  The first-line initial treatment is ATD, which is carbimazole \nor its active metabolite MMI. Methimazole/carbimazole dose typically used is 0.2–0.5 mg/kg daily, with a range from 0.1 mg/kg to 1.0 mg/kg daily (maximal \ninitial dose: 30 mg daily). After 2–4 weeks, when the thyroid hormone levels have \nnormalised, the initial dose should gradually be reduced by 30%–50%. TSH levels may take 2–4 months to appear in the serum and should not be used to titrate the dose. If children develop serious adverse reactions to MMI, RAI or surgery \nshould be considered, because the risks of PTU are considered greater than the \nrisks of RAI or surgery.\n• Hyperthyroidism:  Propylthiouracil (PTU) should not be used in children. If it is \nused, it should be stopped immediately and liver function should be assessed in children who develop anorexia, pruritus, rash, jaundice, light coloured stool or dark urine, joint pain, right upper quadrant pain or abdominal bloating, nausea or malaise due to the risk of idiosyncratic liver failure.\n• Hyperthyroidism:  Definitive therapy available for GD is RAI or thyroidectomy. \nIndications for definitive treatment in children include relapse after an appropriate duration of ATD, a lack of compliance on the part of the patient/caretakers or adverse effects of ATD. The issue of how long ATDs should be used \nin children before considering either RAI or surgery is controversial.\nTHYROID DISORDERS IN THE ELDERLY\nIn subclinical hypothyroidism\n•\t In\tpatients\taged\t>70\tyears,\tif\tserum\tTSH\tis\t≥10\tmIU/L,\tconsider\tL-thyroxine\t treatment \t\nif patients have clear symptoms of hypothyroidism or high vascular risk.\n•\t In\tpatients\taged\t>70\tyears,\tif\tserum\tTSH\tis\t≤10\tmIU/L,\tobserve\tand\trepeat\tTFTs\t\nin 6 months.\n•\t In\tpatients\taged\t≤70\tyears,\tif\tserum\tTSH\tis\t≥10\tmIU/L,\tconsider\t L-thyroxine\t\ntreatment.\n•\t In\tpatients\t aged\t≤70\tyears,\tif\tserum\tTSH\tis\t≤10\tmIU/L\tand\tsymptoms\t of\t\nhypothyroidism are present, consider a 3-month trial of L-thyroxine, then assess \nresponse to treatment."

The inclusion criteria are all thyroid diseases/disorders regardless of study design. The search was limited \nto literature published in the last 10 years and on humans and in English. In addition, \nthe reference lists of all retrieved literature and guidelines were searched and experts in the field contacted to identify relevant studies. All searches were conducted from 1 March 2017 to 31 December 2017. Future CPG updates will consider evidence \npublished after this cut-off date. The details of the search strategy can be obtained \nupon request from the CPG Secretariat. \nReference was also made to other guidelines as listed below: \n• Ministry of Health Malaysia–CPG on Management of Thyroid Dysfunction During \nPregnancy and Postpartum 2007\n• American Thyroid Association–Guidelines for Diagnosis and Management of \nHyperthyroidism and Other Causes of Thyrotoxicosis 2016\n• American Thyroid Association–Guidelines for the Treatment of Hypothyroidism \n2014\n• American Thyroid Association–Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Thyroid Disease During Pregnancy and Postpartum 2017\n• European Thyroid Association–Guidelines on Diagnosis and Treatment of Endogenous Subclinical Hyperthyroidism 2015\n• European Thyroid Association Guideline: Management of Subclinical Hypothyroidism 2013\nThese CPGs were evaluated using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II prior to them being used for reference."

        "text": "CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES \nMANAGEMENT OF THYROID DISORDERS151. THYROID DISORDERS: THE DISEASE\n1.1 EPIDEMIOLOGY OF THYROID DISORDERS IN MALAYSIA\nA large cross-sectional multicentre study done recently demonstrated that the \nprevalence of thyroid dysfunction in Malaysia is 3.4%: 0.6% had overt hyperthyroid -\nism and 2.8% subclinical hyperthyroidism. On the other hand, the prevalence of \nhypothyroidism is 2.1% (0.5% overt and 1.6% subclinical hypothyroidism). Except for overt hyperthyroidism, the majority of subjects with thyroid dysfunction were newly diagnosed. The proportion of those who were newly diagnosed with thyroid \ndysfunction was as high as 68%. Females were found to have a higher prevalence \nof thyroid dysfunction compared to their male counterparts (female: 4.1% vs. male: 1.9% for hyperthyroidism and 2.6% vs. 1.2% for hypothyroidism).\n1 (Level\tIII) \nThe same study looked at the prevalence of goitre and thyroid nodule. The \nprevalence of goitre and thyroid nodule in the Malaysian population is 9.3% and \n3.6%, respectively. Despite having an abnormality at the anterior neck, as high as 62% of those with grade 2 goitre and 68% of those with thyroid nodule were newly diagnosed. In the Malaysian population, there was a higher prevalence of goitre in the Indian population and those aged less than 45 years. There was also a higher \nprevalence of goitre with positive thyroid antibodies in coastal and urban areas, \nindicating increased iodine exposure. On the other hand, there may also be pockets of iodine-deficient areas in rural regions, where a high prevalence of goitre was not associated with positive thyroid antibodies.\n2 (Level III) \nThe prevalence of thyroid antibodies in the Malaysian population was 12.2% for \nanti-thyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO) and 12.1% for anti-thyroglobulin (anti-TG). \nFemales have a higher prevalence of positive thyroid antibodies compared to males (female: 15.2% vs. male: 3.0% for anti-TPO and 15.7% vs. 6.0% for anti-TG). Surprisingly, those with Indian ethnicity had a significantly higher prevalence of anti-TPO compared from other ethnic groups. Coastal and urban regions reported a \nhigher prevalence of thyroid antibodies (as high as 16.1% for anti-TPO and 17.8% for \nanti-TG), supporting the possibility of higher iodine exposure in these areas.\n3 (Level III)\n2. HYPERTHYROIDISM\n2.1 OVERT HYPERTHYROIDISM\n2.1.1 Causes Of Thyrotoxicosis\nThyrotoxicosis occurs due to inappropriately high thyroid hormone action in tissues \nsecondary to elevated thyroid hormone levels, as opposed to hyperthyroidism, which is a subset of thyrotoxicosis due to inappropriately high thyroid hormone synthesis and secretion by the thyroid gland.\n4 (Level I)"

Its prevalence can be as high as 70%–84% in different countries.\n5,6 (Level III, II) Graves’ \ndisease occurs due to the presence of anti-TSH receptor antibodies. Yersinia enterocolitica  infection has been associated with Graves’ disease.\n7 (Level II) Other causes \nof primary hyperthyroidism include toxic adenoma and toxic multinodular goitre. Genetic analysis of resected nodules revealed a mutation in the TSH receptor gene, \nwhich leads to basal activation of the protein kinase A pathway and increased \nT4 production and increased cellular proliferation. In addition, the mutation leads to increased TSH receptor affinity to TSH, thus increasing thyroid hormone synthesis.\n8 (Level\tII) Not all of these hot nodules are actually benign. Some may be \nmalignant, and further workout is necessary. The risk of malignancy in hot nodules may be underestimated, and a literature review reported that a weighted rate of \n3.1% (0–12.5%) of hot nodules are graded as thyroid cancer.\n9(Level I) Thyroid papillary \ncarcinoma can cause hyperthyroidism.10 (Level III) Graves’ disease can co-exist with toxic \nadenoma and is termed as Marine–Lenhart syndrome.11 (Level III) And, finally, there is \na small group of patients with diffuse non-autoimmune hyperthyroidism due to a \ngenetic mutation leading to the production of thyroid hormone without any TSH \nligand.12 (Level III)\nB.  Thyroid Stores Of Preformed Hormone Are Passively Released In Excessive \nAmounts Due To Autoimmune, Infective, Chemical, Or Physical Insults\nDestruction of the thyroid follicle cells can result in the hyperthyroid stage of any thyroiditis. It could be due to autoimmune processes such as Hashimoto’s thyroiditis; infective like subacute thyroiditis (viral) or even Mycobacterium tuberculosis ,\n13,14 (Level \nIII) cellulitis of the skin anterior to the neck or due to physical insult from a rapidly \ngrowing anaplastic carcinoma of the thyroid gland or primary thyroid lymphoma.15, \n16 (Level III)\nC.  Exposure To Extrathyroidal Sources Of Thyroid Hormone Either Endogenous Or Exogenous\nEndogenous sources of thyroid hormones include struma ovarii, which is actually teratoma of the ovaries composed mainly of thyroid tissue\n17 (Level III) and metastatic \nthyroid carcinoma secreting thyroid hormones. These are actually rare, with fewer than 100 cases reported since 1946.\n18 (Level III) Exogenous sources of thyroid \nhormones are becoming commoner nowadays. Over-the–counter supplements containing thyroid support/thyroid supplements/thyroid health actually contain \nvarious amounts of T3 and/or T4 that are readily available over the Internet – via \nonline purchases.\n19, 20 (Level III,II) They are cheap, there is no need for a prescription, \nand people have more privacy in managing their own health.

These supplements may not mention the actual ingredients \nused.20,21 (Level II,III) In addition, exogenous sources of thyroid hormones can come from \ncooked animals’ thyroid gland, as reported in an epidemic of thyrotoxicosis after ingesting thyroid hormone-containing beef hamburger.\n22 (Level III)\nD.  The Thyroid Gland Is Excessively Stimulated By Trophic Factors Such As Thyrotropin-Stimulating Hormone (TSH) And Other Factors. \nTSHoma, which is pituitary gland thyrotrophs adenoma secreting excessive \namounts of TSH leading to secondary hyperthyroidism is rare. Besides, gestational \ntrophoblastic disease, which secretes b-HCG (which has partial molecular similarity with TSH) can lead to thyrotoxicosis. It is also rare, as only 2.0 per 1000 pregnancies have gestational trophoblastic disease, of which only 7% have biochemical \nthyrotoxicosis.\n23 (Level III) Iodinated contrast materials are increasingly being used \nduring CT scans and angiographic procedures. Amiodarones are used frequently \nfor various types of tachyarrhythmia. The iodine content in radiographic contrast \nmaterials and amiodarone is much higher than the amount human beings actually \nrequire. This excess iodine will lead to Jod–Basedow thyrotoxicosis.24, 25 (Level III)  \nThe prevalence of contrast iodine-induced subclinical hyperthyroidism can reach \nup to 2.66%26, 27 (Level II) and contrast iodine-induced hyperthyroidism up to 1.7%.28,29 \n(Level II,III) Amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis is more prevalent, and is in the range  \nof 3.0%–20.8%.30, 31, 32, 33 (Level III) There are other rare case reports of thyrotoxicosis  \nsuch as due to L-asparaginase chemotherapy, which leads to transient thyrotoxicosis.\n34 (Level III)\n2.1.2 How To Diagnose Hyperthyroidism?\n2.1.2.1 Biochemical Evaluation For Diagnosis Of Hyperthyroidism Serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) measurement has the highest sensitivity \nand specificity of any single blood test and is used as an initial screening test for \nhyperthyroidism.\n35 (Level III) However, diagnostic accuracy is improved when serum \nTSH and free T4 (fT4) are assessed at initial evaluation. If fT4 is within the normal range and TSH is suppressed, then free T3 (fT3) should be measured. In overt \nhyperthyroidism, serum fT4, fT3, or both are elevated and serum TSH is suppressed \n(usually <0.01 mIU/L).\n4(Level III)\n2.1.2.2 Diagnostic Testing For Aetiology Of Hyperthyroidism\nThyroid UltrasoundWhen expertise is available and there is no stigmata of Graves’ disease and the \naetiology not clear by history, thyroid ultrasound comprising both conventional \ngreyscale and colour flow Doppler examination is recommended as the imaging procedure for hyperthyroidism work-up.

However, thyroid scintigraphy is significantly less sensitive for diagnosing thyroid nodules measuring less than 1–1.5 cm.\n48 (Level III) The most \nused radionuclides in scintigraphy according to the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists/European Thyroid Association (AACE/ETA) guideline are \n123I or \n99mTc.

A special diet is not required before RAI therapy, \nbut nutritional supplements that may contain excess iodine and seaweeds should be avoided for at least seven days. A low-iodine diet may be useful for those with \nrelatively low RAIU to increase the proportion of RAI trapped. Patients who might \nbenefit from adjunctive MMI or carbimazole may be those who tolerate hyperthyroid symptoms poorly. Such patients frequently have free T4 at 2–3 times the upper limit of normal. Young and middle-aged patients who are otherwise healthy and \nclinically well compensated despite significant biochemical hyperthyroidism can \ngenerally receive RAI without pretreatment. If given as pretreatment, MMI and carbimazole should be discontinued before the administration of RAI. Continuation of ATDs up to 2–3 days prior to RAI can prevent a short-term increase of thyroid hormone levels, which is found after six days. In elderly patients or in those with \nunderlying cardiovascular disease, resuming MMI or carbimazole 3–7 days after \nRAI administration should be considered and generally tapered as thyroid function normalises. In selected patients with Graves’ hyperthyroidism who would have been candidates for pretreatment with ATDs because of comorbidities or excessive \nsymptoms, but who are allergic to ATDs, the duration of hyperthyroidism may be \nshortened by administering iodine (e.g. saturated solution of potassium iodide [SSKI]) beginning a week after RAI administration.\n4 (Level II)\nThe goal of RAI therapy in GD is to control hyperthyroidism by rendering the patient hypothyroid; this treatment is very effective, provided a sufficient radiation dose is deposited in the thyroid. This outcome can be accomplished equally well by \neither administering a fixed dose or by calculating the activity based on the size of \nthe thyroid and its ability to trap RAI. The first method is simple, while the second method requires two unknowns to be determined: the uptake of RAI and the size of the thyroid.\n4 (Level II)\nAnti-Thyroid Drugs (ATDs)\nThe goal of the therapy is to render the patient euthyroid as quickly and safely as \npossible. These medications do not cure Graves’ hyperthyroidism; however, when \ngiven in adequate doses, they are very effective in controlling hyperthyroidism. When \nthey fail to achieve euthyroidism, the usual cause is nonadherence. The treatment itself might have a beneficial immunosuppressive role, either to primarily decrease thyroid-specific autoimmunity, or secondarily, by ameliorating the hyperthyroid \nstate, which may restore the dysregulated immune system back to normal. \nCarbimazole is rapidly converted to MMI in the serum (10 mg of carbimazole is metabolised to approximately 6 mg of MMI). They work in an identical fashion, and both are effective as a single daily dose. At the start of MMI therapy, initial doses of 10–30 mg daily are used to restore euthyroidism, and the dose can then be titrated \ndown to a maintenance level (generally 5–10 mg daily). The dose of MMI should be \ntargeted to the degree of thyroid dysfunction because too low dose will not restore a euthyroid state in patients with severe disease and an excessive dose can cause iatrogenic hypothyroidism in patients with mild disease. In addition, adverse drug \nreactions are more frequent with higher MMI doses. Thus, it is important to use"

It is important to monitor serum T3 levels initially because some patients normalise their free T4 levels with \nMMI, but have persistently elevated serum T3, indicating continuing thyrotoxicosis. \nMethimazole has the benefit of once-a–day administration and a reduced risk of major side effects compared to propylthiouracil (PTU). Propylthiouracil has a  \nshorter duration of action and is usually administered two or three times daily, \nstarting with 50–150 mg three times daily, depending on the severity of the \nhyperthyroidism. As clinical findings and thyroid function tests results return to normal, a reduction to a maintenance PTU dose of 50 mg two or three times daily is usually possible. When more rapid biochemical control is needed in patients with severe thyrotoxicosis, an initial split dose of MMI (e.g. 15 or 20 mg twice a day) \nmaybe more effective than a single daily dose because the duration of action of MMI \nmay be less than 24 hours.\n4 (Level II)\nThe adverse effects of ATDs can be divided into common, minor allergic side effects and rare but serious allergic/toxic events such as agranulocytosis, vasculitis, or hepatic damage. The minor allergic reactions included pruritus or a limited, minor \nrash.

The remission rate varies considerably between geographical areas. A meta-analysis shows \nthe remission rate in adults is not improved by a course of ATDs longer than 18 \nmonths. A lower remission rate has been described in men, smokers (especially men), and those with large goitres (>80 g). Higher initial doses of MMI (60–80 mg/day) do not improve remission rates; they increase the risk of side effects and are \nnot recommended.

In such patients, the thyroid gland \noften remains palpable.\nBeta-blockers that were instituted prior to RAI treatment should be tapered when \nfree T4 and free T3 have returned to the reference range. As free T4 and free T3 \nimprove, ATDs can usually be tapered, which allows an assessment of the response to RAI. Most patients eventually develop hypothyroidism, which is indicated by a free T4 below the normal range. At this point, levothyroxine should be instituted. \nTSH levels may not rise immediately with the development of hypothyroidism \nand should not be used initially to determine the need for levothyroxine. When thyroid hormone replacement is initiated, the dose should be adjusted based on an assessment of free T4. Overt hypothyroidism should be avoided, especially in patients with active GO.\nOnce euthyroidism is achieved, lifelong annual thyroid function testing is \nrecommended at least annually, or if the patient experiences symptoms of hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. Since TSH levels may remain suppressed for a month or longer after hyperthyroidism resolves, the levels should be interpreted \ncautiously and only in concert with free T4 and free T3.\n4 (Level II)\nResponse to RAI therapy can be assessed by monitoring the size of the gland, \nthyroid function, and clinical signs and symptoms. The goal of re-treatment is to control hyperthyroidism with certainty by rendering the patient hypothyroid. \nPatients who have persistent, suppressed TSH with normal free T3 and free T4 \nmay not require immediate retreatment but should be monitored closely for either relapse or development of hypothyroidism. In the small percentage of patients with hyperthyroidism refractory to several applications of RAI, surgery should be \nconsidered.\n4 (Level II)\nPatients Treated With ATD\nPeriodic clinical and biochemical evaluation of thyroid status in patients taking \nATDs is necessary, and it is essential that patients understand its importance. An \nassessment of serum free T4 and free T3 should be obtained about 2–6 weeks after initiation of therapy, depending on the severity of the thyrotoxicosis, and the dose of medication should be adjusted accordingly. Serum T3 should be monitored because the serum free T4 levels may normalise despite persistent elevation of \nserum free T3. Serum TSH may remain suppressed for several months after starting \ntherapy, and it is therefore not a good parameter for monitoring therapy early in the course. Once the patient is euthyroid, the dose of MMI can usually be decreased by 30%–50% and biochemical testing repeated in 4–6 weeks. Once euthyroid levels \nare achieved with the minimal dose of medication, clinical and laboratory evaluation \ncan be undertaken at intervals of 2–3 months. If a patient is receiving long-term MMI (>18 months), this interval can be increased to 6 months.\n4 (Level II)"

However, changes in clinical symptoms should be followed longitudinally and taken into consideration together with serum TSH and thyroid \nhormones levels, comorbidities, and other potential causes.\n91 (Level I)\n3.1.3 How Should Levothyroxine Administration Be Timed With  \nRespect To Meals And Beverages In Order To Maintain Maximum,  \nConsistent Absorption?\nWhen levothyroxine is co-administered with food, absorption is reduced compared \nwith absorption in the fasting state.92 (level II) Taking levothyroxine at bedtime has been \nshown to be just as efficacious as taking it in the morning, with no significant changes in the TSH levels.\n93–94 (Level II) It is important to consider not only when the absorption \nof levothyroxine would be optimal, but also what timing promotes adherence."

This is consistent with the ileum being the main site of levothyroxine absorption.\n105-106 (Level II) It should \nalso be noted that autoimmune atrophic gastritis is particularly prevalent in older patients with hypothyroidism and Hashimoto’s thyroiditis.\n107 (Level II)\n Recommendation\n •\t Evaluation\t for\tgastrointestinal\t disorders\t (H. pylori, atrophic gastritis, and \ncoeliac’s disease) should be considered in patients requiring a much higher-\nthan-expected dose of levothyroxine.

Higher serum fT4 (but not fT3) was associated with lower GHQ-12 scores, implying improved well-being.\n116 (Level II) Another \ncommunity-based study from Norway suggested a higher prevalence of depression and anxiety, as measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) \nscores in hypothyroid women aged 40 years and older taking levothyroxine.\n117\t(Level II) \nIn a third study from the USA, levothyroxine-treated women were shown to have \ndecrements in health status, psychological function, working memory, and motor \nlearning compared to euthyroid controls. However, correlations between TSH \nlevels and outcomes were not found.118 (Level II) The evidence suggests that despite \nnormal serum TSH levels, psychological distress, impaired well-being, and cognitive disturbances occur more often in patients with hypothyroidism treated with \nlevothyroxine monotherapy than controls and that 5%–10% of patients treated with \nlevothyroxine monotherapy with normal serum TSH can have persistent symptoms related to the disease and therapy.\n3.1.16 Is There A Biological Rationale For Persistent Complaints In  \nL-T4–Treated Hypothyroid Patients?Two most common causes of hypothyroidism are Hashimoto’s disease and \nthyroid ablation in Graves’ disease, and therefore most hypothyroid patients have autoimmune thyroid disease. Autoimmune thyroid disease is associated with other autoimmune disorders, with rheumatoid arthritis being the most common \ncoexisting autoimmune disorder. Also, there are significantly increased relative risks \nfor almost all other autoimmune diseases (RR >10 for systemic lupus erythematosus, Addison’s disease, pernicious anaemia, coeliac disease, and vitiligo). Due to the nonspecific nature of associated symptoms, many of these conditions may go unnoticed for a long time. Therefore, screening for other autoimmune diseases has \nbeen recommended for patients with autoimmune thyroid disease who present \nwith new or unresolving non-specific symptoms.\n119–121 (Level II)\nPersistent symptoms despite normal serum TSH levels in patients with hypothyroidism treated with levothyroxine monotherapy have been suggested to be due to the patients’ awareness of a chronic disease, thyroid autoimmunity"

Repeat measurements of TSH at two-to-three–month intervals from the \ninitial finding of a raised TSH are reasonable.\n125 (Level III)\n3.2.2 How To Diagnose Subclinical Hypothyroidism?\nSubclinical thyroid disease is a laboratory diagnosis. It is defined as a serum TSH \nconcentration above the statistically defined upper limit of the reference range \nwhen serum fT4 and T3 concentrations are within their reference ranges.126 (Level I);\t\n127 (Level I; 128 (Level I) However, since an array of factors has been shown to lead to \ntransient abnormalities of serum TSH, investigation for raised TSH requires repeat measurements within two to three months to establish a firm diagnosis.\n128 (Level 1) \nTransient elevations of TSH may occur in numerous circumstances, such as subacute or painless thyroiditis, following withdrawal of L-thyroxine, during recovery from \na significant non-thyroidal illness, and during treatment with various drugs (e.g. \nlithium, amiodarone).\n128 (Level I) Patients with subclinical disease may have few or no \ndefinitive clinical signs or symptoms of thyroid dysfunction.128 (Level I) Serum TSH has \na log-linear relationship with circulating thyroid hormone levels (a two-fold change  \nin free thyroxine will produce a 100-fold change in TSH).125 (Level I) The generally  \naccepted reference range for serum TSH is 0.40–4.2 mIU/L.125 (Level I); 129 (Level IV) \nDetermination of anti-TPO antibodies may be helpful in defining the risk of progression (2.6% each year if thyroid peroxidase [TPO] antibodies are absent and"

The only large study to \nsystematically investigate symptoms in patients with overt and SCHypo as compared \nto euthyroid controls is the Colorado Thyroid Disease Prevalence study. This large questionnaire-based study conducted among 25,862 subjects reported a small but significant difference in symptoms between euthyroid and subclinical hypothyroid \npatients. The main problems reported were drier skin, poorer memory, slower \nthinking, weaker muscles, greater tiredness, more muscle cramps, more feeling cold, deeper and hoarser voice, puffier eyes, and more constipation in SCHypo.\n133 (Level\tIV)\nThe Tromsö study compared symptoms in 154 controls and 89 SCHypo subjects with a TSH between 3.5 and 10.0 mIU/L using a similar panel of questions. Tiredness, but none of the other symptoms, was significantly different between the groups.\n134 (Level IV) \nThese studies suggest that some patients with subclinical hypothyroidism do indeed develop clinical manifestations of mild thyroid failure.\nPatients with SCHypo have a high rate of progression to clinically overt \nhypothyroidism. In a prospective cohort study by Gerold Huber, Jean-Jacques  \nStaub et al., 82 women with subclinical hypothyroidism underwent a follow-up \nfor a mean of 9.2 years. Patients were classified into three groups on the basis of  \ntheir\tinitial\tTSH\tvalues:\t≥4\tto\t6,\t6\tto\t12,\tand\tgreater\tthan\t12\tmIU/mL. The 10-year \nincidence of hypothyroidism was 0%, 42.8%, and 76.9%, respectively, in these three groups.\n135 (Level IV) The rate of progression to overt hypothyroidism was significantly \nhigher in women with a higher baseline serum TSH concentration.133 (Level IV) The \npresence of anti-TPO antibodies was also correlated with a significantly increased incidence of progression to overt hypothyroidism.\n135 (Level IV); 136 (Level IV); 137 (Level IV) However, \nsome people do not show progression and some experience normalisation.135 (Level IV); \n136 (Level IV); 137 (Level IV); 138 (Level IV)"

Thyroid nodules are generally benign hyperplastic (or colloid) nodules or benign follicular adenomas and, uncommonly, \ncarcinoma occurs in 5%–10% of nodules. A nontoxic goitre is defined as any thyroid \nenlargement characterised by uniform or selective growth of thyroid tissue that is not associated with overt hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism and that does not result from inflammation or neoplasia.\n4.1 HOW COMMON ARE THYROID NODULES/GOITRE?\nThe prevalence of goitre, diffuse or nodular, differs widely depending on iodine \nintake by the population. Goitre may occur endemically, due mainly to iodine deficiency, or sporadically. By using ultrasonography as the screening method, a \nprevalence of up to 30%–50% of an unselected adult population has been described \nas having goitre, with a higher prevalence noted in iodine-deficient areas and in older people. \nThyroid nodules are a common clinical finding. In large population-based  \nstudies, the estimated prevalence of thyroid nodules detected by palpation is  \n4%–7%.\n145–146 (Level II) Imaging studies identify up to 10 times more nodules, mostly \nbenign.

Therefore, affected patients do not have any symptoms or \nsigns of thyroid dysfunction and present with neck lump or swelling. About 70% of \npatients with sporadic nontoxic goitre complains of neck discomfort. Some patients have concerns about cosmetic appearance and fear of possible malignancy.\nLarge goitres may displace or compress the trachea, oesophagus, and neck vessels. \nThere may be compressive symptoms and signs such as inspiratory stridor, \ndysphagia, or a choking sensation. Compression of the recurrent laryngeal nerve \ncan result in hoarseness of voice due to vocal cord paralysis, usually associated with thyroid malignancy.\n4.3 CLINICAL EVALUATION OF THYROID NODULES/GOITRE\nThe main objective of the evaluation of a thyroid nodule is to differentiate malignant \nlesions from benign conditions. Most nodules are asymptomatic and benign. The \ninitial evaluation of a patient with a thyroid nodule should include a complete history \nand physical examination.\n149 (Level III)\nHistorical features that favour benign disease are a family history of Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, benign thyroid nodule/goitre, and symptoms of hypothyroidism/hyperthyroidism. A sudden increase in the size of the nodule with pain and \ntenderness suggests a cyst or localised thyroiditis.\n149 (Level III)\nHistorical features that suggest malignancy:\n• Young age (<20 years) or old age (>60 years)\n• Male gender\n• History of external neck radiation during childhood/adolescence\n• Rapid growth\n• Recent changes in speaking, breathing, or swallowing\n• Family history of thyroid cancer or MEN type 2\nPhysical manifestations of thyroid malignancy:• Firm to hard consistency of nodule\n• Irregular shape\n• Fixation to underlying or overlying tissues\n• Vocal cord paralysis\n• Suspicious regional lymphadenopathy"

This reporting system enables assessment of thyroid malignancy risk and helps select patients for FNA and/or surgery, and may substantially reduce \nthe number of unnecessary invasive procedures. The structured reporting greatly \nfacilitates communication between radiologists and physicians, as well as between practitioners and patients.\nFor\tpatients\t with\tmultiple\t nodules\t(≥4)\tpresent,\t only\tthe\tfour\thighest\tscoring\t\nnodules, should be scored, reported, and followed up. Follow up shall be according \nto the highest grade TI-RADS nodule available. Other nodules are also reassessed with ultrasound. Interval enlargement on follow up is significant if there is an increase of 20% and 2 mm in two dimensions, or a 50% increase in volume. If the ACR TI-RADS level increases between scans, an interval scan the following year \nis again recommended. Ultrasound follow up of a thyroid nodule can be ceased  \nafter\t5 years\tif\tthere\tis\tno\tincrement\t in\tTI-\tRADS\tgrade\tand\tsize.\tThus\tstability\tof\t\nthe nodule over that time span reliabily indicates that the nodule has a benign \ncharacteristic. \n4.5 FINE NEEDLE ASPIRATION BIOPSY (FNAB) OF THYROID NODULES\nFine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) of thyroid nodules is the main technique for \ndiagnosing thyroid cancer; it has high sensitivity and specificity rates. The technique is easy to perform and safe. It requires an adequate specimen, which should contain \nat least five or six groups of 10–15 well-preserved cells. Ultrasound-guided FNAB \nreduces the possibility of non-diagnostic specimens and is preferred in nodules with a higher likelihood of either non-diagnostic cytology (>25–50% cystic) or sampling error (non-palpable or posterior location).\n151 (Level III)\nFNAB is recommended for suspicious lesions (TR3–TR5) with the specific size criteria, according to the ACR Ti-RADS 2017 management algorithm (Refer Figure 6)\n•\t TR1: no\tFNA\trequired\n•\t TR2: no\tFNA\trequired"

The major precipitant for thyroid storm is non-compliance or discontinuation of anti-thyroid \ndrugs, followed by severe infection, cardiac event, thyroidal and non-thyroidal \nsurgery, trauma, administration of iodinated contrast and radioactive iodine, pregnancy and delivery, adrenal insufficiency, and diabetic ketoacidosis.\n158(Level III); \n159 (Level\tIII);\t160\t(Level\tIII)\nMultiorgan and acute heart failure are the main cause of mortality.163 (Level III) \nEarly recognition and intensive treatment will improve survival in patients with thyroid storm. In view of the high mortality rates, intensive care unit admission \nand multidisciplinary expertise encompassing endocrinologists, intensivists, \ncardiologists, hepatologists, and neurologists are required with multiorgan decompensation.\n5.1.1 How is Thyroid Storm Diagnosed?\nThe diagnosis of thyroid storm is made clinically in a thyrotoxic patient with \nevidence of decompensation. The diagnosis may be challenging, as often there is an overlap with clinical features of other critical medical conditions.

Lugol’s iodine should not be given beyond 10 days or else this would lead to escape from the Wolff-Chaikoff \nphenomenon. Patients known to be allergic to inorganic iodide containing drugs \nshould not be given these agents. Inorganic iodide may also be administered via rectal or nasogastric routes in critically ill patients. The solution should be diluted in water or taken with bread to avoid mucosal irritation."

Total plasma exchange removes thyroid hormones, antibodies, and circulating \ncytokines. Total plasma exchange with 40–50 mL/kg of replacement fluid has \ndemonstrated improved outcomes and resolution of thyroid storm and should be continued until clinical improvements are noted.\n184 (Level III); 185 (Level III) fT4 and fT3 \nshould be sampled before and after each session. Two types of replacement therapy: fresh frozen plasma (FFP) or albumin have been used in TPE for \nthyroid storm. Although there is no randomised study to compare between  \nthe two, fresh frozen plasma (FFP) has been preferentially used because it contains \nthyroid binding globulin (TBG) that will better enhance removal of TBG bound thyroid hormones.\n166 (Level III) Continuous hemodiafiltration (CHDF) is sometimes used \nin parallel with TPE in haemodynamically compromised patients.166 (Level III)\n Recommendation\n •\t TPE\t(with\tFFP\tas\tfluid\treplacement)\t should\tbe\tconsidered\t in\tsevere/rapidly\t\ndeteriorating thyroid storm or with contraindications to standard multimodal \ntherapy"

These include \nintravenous fluids, respiratory support, and nutritional support. Cooling measures \nusing cooling blankets and with the use of acetaminophen is recommended. The use \nof salicylates should be avoided as these drugs displace bound thyroxine leading to further elevations of free thyroid hormone.\n4 (Level III); 166 (Level III) Infection should be \ntreated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, tailored to source of infection.

The onset of disease is between one and two weeks. Typically, the hyperthyroid state lasts for 2–3 weeks, peaks at 1 week after the onset, followed by a period \nof hypothyroidism which lasts for 6–12 weeks. Subsequently, euthyroid state \nensues.\n211 (Level\t III);\t219\t(Level\tIII) Most of studies recorded moderate increase in thyroxine level  \nwith suppressed thyroid stimulating hormone, while thyroid storm is rare. 210 (Level III);  \n211 (Level III); 212 (Level III); 213 (Level III); 215 (Level III); 216 (Level III) A cross-sectional study comparing the  \nthyroid function of patients with subacute thyroiditis and Graves’ disease demonstrates that the free tri-iodothyronine (fT3) to free thyroxine (fT4) was \nsignificantly lower in the former. An fT3/fT4 ratio of less than 0.3 has a sensitivity \nof 52.4% and specificity of 91.3% for destructive thyroiditis.\n220 (Level II) Apart from \nthyroxine and triiodothyronine, thyroglobulin levels are also elevated.213 (Level III);  \n216 (Level III); 219 (Level III) The presence of thyroid antibodies in subacute thyroiditis varies \nfrom study to study (between 4% and 20%).214 (Level III); 215 (Level III); 217 (Level III) However, \noverall, the thyroid antibody titre in destructive thyroiditis is much lower compared from Graves’ disease.\n219 (Level III);220 (Level II)\nRaised erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is one of the important diagnostic criteria.

Overt maternal hypothyroidism is also characterised by a decreased serum fT4 below the lower limit of the pregnancy specific reference \nrange while SCHypo is characterised by an isolated high TSH with fT4 within the \npregnancy-specific reference range. At present, serum TSH remains the main determinant used to guide treatment decisions and target. The difficulties lie in the presence of substantial differences in the upper reference limits of pregnancy specific reference range for TSH between populations which varies from 2.15 to  \n4.68 mIU/L.\n228 (Level II) It is therefore recommended that each institution should establish \ntheir own pregnancy-specific reference intervals for each trimester of pregnancy using the local population. If this is not available, an arbitrary level of 4 mIU/L can be \nused as the TSH upper reference limit. This level represents a reduction of 0.5 mIU/L \nof the non-pregnant TSH upper reference limit for most assays.\n229 (Level II)\n Recommendations\n •\t Each\t institution\t should\testablish\t their\town\tpregnancy\t specific\treference\t\nintervals for each trimester of pregnancy using the local population \n •\t As\tthere\tis\tno\tpublished\t data\ton\tthe\tpregnancy\t specific\treference\t range\t\nrepresentative of the Malaysian pregnant population, we recommend a TSH \nupper reference limit of 4 mIU/L \n7.1.2 What Are the Prevalence And Common Causes of Maternal Hypothyroidism?\nThe prevalence of hypothyroidism in pregnancy ranges from 0.3% to 4.8%.\n230,\t231\t(Level III);\t\n232 (Level II); 233 (Level III); 234,235,236 (Level II) The onset of the disease in pregnancy is rare.235\t(Level II) \nThe most common cause of hypothyroidism in pregnancy is chronic autoimmune \nthyroiditis (Hashimoto’s thyroiditis).230, 231, 233 (Level III) Other causes include previous"

How Should It Be Monitored?\nAn increase in LT4 requirement occurs soon after conception at four to six weeks of \ngestation. The LT4 requirement gradually increases through mid-gestation between 16–20 weeks and plateaus thereafter in the third trimester until delivery.\n267 (Level II) \nA retrospective observational study demonstrated a 45%–70% increment in LT4 dosing at the end pregnancy for women who received LT4 before conception.\n268\t(Level II) \nAnother retrospective study demonstrated an increment of 13%–27% during the first trimester which further increased to 26%–51% by the second trimester with no \nsignificant further increase in the third trimester.\n269 (Level II) The percentage increment \nin LT4 requirement was generally higher for hypothyroidism post thyroidectomy or \nradioactive iodine compared to autoimmune thyroiditis.268 (Level II); 269 (Level II) A prospective \nRCT comparing two LT4 dosage increment strategies with increment of LT4 tablets by two tablets per week versus three tablets per week, i.e. 29% versus 43% in early \npregnancy showed that both strategies are equally effective in keeping the serum \nTSH within target, with the first strategy associated with a lower risk of overtreatment resulting in TSH suppression.\n270 (Level I) However, the target TSH in this study was up \nto 4.9 mIU/L, which is significantly higher than the pregnancy-specific TSH upper reference limit for most populations.\n228 (Level II) This study also showed that a thyroid \nfunction testing interval of four-weekly was able to detect more than 90% of all the abnormal values throughout pregnancy.\n270 (Level I) As the increased LT4 requirement \nduring gestation is due to the physiological requirement of an increased total body thyroxine pool during pregnancy, the LT4 dosing should be reduced to pre-pregnant \ndose upon delivery. However, an observational study on patients with Hashimoto’s \nthyroiditis revealed an increased LT4 requirement postpartum compared to before conception with no reduction versus during pregnancy was possibly related to postpartum exacerbation of autoimmune thyroiditis.\n271 (Level II)\n Recommendations\n •\t Pregnant\t women\twho\tare\talready\ttreated\twith\tLT4\tbefore\tconception\t are\t\nrecommended to have their LT4 dosage increased by 30%–50% upon conception \nwith a higher percentage being considered for post ablative hypothyroidism \nand lower percentage for autoimmune hypothyroidism \n •\t Thyroid\t function\ttesting\tshould\tbe\tperformed\t every\tfour\tweeks\tfrom\tconception\t\nuntil mid-gestation and at least once during the middle of the third trimester \n •\t After\tdelivery,\tthe\tLT4\tdosage\tcan\tbe\tgenerally\t re-adjusted\t to\tthe\tprepregnancy\t\nrequirement"

Transient thyrotoxicosis is followed by transient hypothyroidism with a return to the euthyroid state by the end of the initial postpartum year (classical form). Incidence in \nthe general population is 5.4%. About 22% of patients present with the classical form, \n30% with isolated thyrotoxicosis, and 48% with isolated hypothyroidism.\n312\t(Level III)  \nThe thyrotoxic phase of PPT typically occurs between 2 and 6 months postpartum. \nAll episodes of thyrotoxicosis resolve spontaneously. The hypothyroid phase of PPT \noccurs from 3 to 12 months postpartum with about 20%–40% of cases resulting in \npermanent hypothyroidism in the ensuing 3–12 years.313 (Level III) A prospective study \nreported that 50% of women with PPT remained hypothyroid at the end of the first postpartum year.\n314 (Level III)\n7.3.2 What Is The Aetiology?\nIt is an autoimmune disorder associated with the presence of thyroid antibodies \n(TPOAb and TgAb), lymphocyte abnormalities, complement activation, increased levels of IgG1, increased Natural Killer (NK) cell activity, and specific Human \nLeukocyte Antigen (HLA) haplotypes.\n313 (Level III) Women who are thyroid Ab positive \nin the first trimester have a high risk of developing PPT, ranging from 33% to \n50%.313 (Level III) Women with the highest Ab titres also have the highest risk of PPT.

An elevated T4:T3 ratio suggests the presence of PPT. Physical stigmata of GD, such as goitre with a bruit or ophthalmopathy, are diagnostic when present. The radioiodine uptake is elevated or normal in GD and low in the thyrotoxic phase of PPT.\n313 (Level II)\n7.3.4 What Is The Management?\nDuring the thyrotoxic phase of PPT, symptomatic women may be treated with \nbeta-blockers.313 (Level III); 312 (Level III); 230 (Level III) A beta-blocker that is safe for lactating \nwomen, such as propranolol or metoprolol, at the lowest possible dose to alleviate \nsymptoms is the treatment of choice. Therapy is typically required for a few weeks. \nAntithyroid drugs are not recommended for the treatment of the thyrotoxic phase of  \nPPT.313 (Level III); 312 (Level III); 228 (Level III) LT4 treatment should be started during the hypothyroid \nphase of PPT if the patient is symptomatic, lactating or if the patient is considering \nanother conception. Asymptomatic women or women with mild symptoms who \nchoose not to be treated need to have their TFT checked every 4- to 8-weekly until a \neuthyroid state is restored.313 (Level III); 312 (Level III); 228 (Level III) Length of time that LT4 should \nbe continued has not been systematically evaluated.

Nearly 10%–50% of women in whom the hypothyroid \nphase of PPT initially resolves will ultimately go on to develop permanent hypothyroidism.\n313 (Level III); 314 (Level III) Factors associated with an increased risk of \ndeveloping permanent hypothyroidism are multiparity, thyroid hypoechogenicity on ultrasound, greater severity of the initial hypothyroidism, higher TPOAb titre, \ngreater maternal age, and a history of pregnancy loss.\n313 (Level III) Women with a prior \nhistory of PPT should have TSH testing annually to evaluate for the development \nof permanent hypothyroidism.313 (Level III) Women who have had a prior history of \nPPT, who have another autoimmune disease, or are known to be TPO-Ab-positive  \nshould be screened at 3 months for PPT with a TSH and fT4.

The incidence of antithyroid antibodies was highest in Hispanic-American adolescents and lowest in black non-Hispanic adolescents. Non-Hispanic whites had an incidence rate between these \ntwo groups.\n52 (level II-2)\n7.4.1.2 What Are The Clinical Features Of Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis In Children \nAnd Adolescents?\nThe most common manifestation of hypothyroidism in children is declining \nheight velocity that results in short stature which tends to be insidious in onset \nand may present for several years before other symptoms occur. Other common symptoms are altered school performance, sluggishness, lethargy, cold intolerance, constipation, dry skin, brittle hair, facial puffiness and muscle pain.\n318 (Level II-2)\nThe commonest physical finding at presentation is a diffusely enlarged thyroid gland/goitre in 39.5% in one series. Other physical findings are short stature; apparent overweight; puffy facies with dull, placid expression; bradycardia; \npseudohypertrophy of the muscles and delayed deep tendon reflexes.\n319 (Level II-2)\nPubertal development is delayed in most patients; however, some children have \nprecocious puberty characterised by breast development and vaginal bleeding in girls and macro-orchidism in boys.\n320 (Level II-2)\n Recommendation \n •\t The\tclinical\tfeatures\tof\thypothyroidism\t in\tchildren\tand\tadolescents\t are\tsimilar\t\nto adults; however, in children, evaluations of height and puberty are essential \nsince growth retardation and abnormal puberty are common"

Among all children, euthyroid goitre is more common than \nhypothyroidism.52 (Level\t II-2) Hashimoto’s thyroiditis with thyrotoxicosis (Hashitoxicosis) \nin general has a definitive resolution of hyperthyroidism in an average of eight months.\n318 (Level II-2) In patients with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis with euthyroidism, 64.8% \nremains euthyroid after 5 years. Predictive factors for future development of hypothyroidism are presence of goitre, elevated TPO antibodies, ATG antibodies, \nand progressive increase in TSH.\n318 (Level II-2)\nAn unusual outcome of Hashimoto’s is the conversion to Graves’ disease in 7% \nof children and adolescents, which is due to alteration in the biological activity of the TSH receptor antibody from predominantly a TSH receptor-blocking antibody \nduring the hypothyroid phase to a thyroid-stimulating antibody when Graves’ \ndisease manifests.\n318 (Level II-2)\nIn Hashimoto’s thyroiditis with subclinical hypothyroidism at the end of five-year follow-up, 89.6% had thyroid dysfunction.

There are varying studies reporting the \nprevalence of hypothyroidism in PWS that range from 4.8%348 (Level III) to as high as \n20%–30%.349 (Level IV) However, a small study looking at thyroid status in PWS patients \nup until two years of life reported that in 72.2% patients, serum TT4 and/or fT4 levels \nwere below the 2.5th percentile of the reference population.350 (Level III) This study \nsuggests that transient or definitive TSH-releasing hormone (TRH)–TSH thyroid axis dysfunction may frequently be present in young PWS patients. Awareness of \nthis dysfunction in this critical period of thyroid hormone action on neurological \ndevelopment is important among paediatricians.\nEvaluation of thyroid function in children with PWS, before and during GH treatment, \nwas carried out in a study of 75 PWS children. It was found that during GH treatment, \nfT4 decreased significantly to low-normal levels, while TSH levels remained  \nnormal.

School-aged children and adolescents could present with poor concentration, deterioration in school performance, irritability, fatigue, palpitations, heat intolerance, fine tremor, and goitre. Younger prepubertal children more \ncommonly present with poor weight gain and frequent bowel movements and tend \nto be diagnosed later.\n353 (Level III); 354 (Level III) In the paediatric age group, hyperthyroidism \ncan also affect growth, puberty, and bone density.353\t(Level III)\tIncrease in height velocity \nwith advanced bone age, is related to the duration of hyperthyroidism. As in adults, children with GD may have a lower than normal bone mass; however, bone mass is \noften restored to normal levels after two years of an euthyroid state. \nThe size of the thyroid gland is variable. It is usually symmetrically enlarged, firm, \nuniformly smooth, and not tender. Ophthalmic abnormalities are usually less severe in children than in adults.\n355 (Level III) Thyrotoxicosis crisis and pretibial myxoedema are \nrare in childhood. \nA suppressed serum TSH and an elevated free T4 or T3 or both confirms the diagnosis \nof hyperthyroidism. With paediatric patients, it is important that free T4 levels are interpreted according to the reference range for age. There also exists a variation in the reference levels with different manufacturer assays. Some patients, especially prepubertal children, may have elevated serum T3, but normal free T4 levels (isolated \nT3 toxicosis).\n4\t(Level III) In a patient with a symmetrically enlarged thyroid, recent onset \nof orbitopathy, and moderate-to–severe hyperthyroidism, the diagnosis of GD is \nlikely and further evaluation of the aetiology is often unnecessary.4 (Level III) If the \ndiagnosis is not apparent, further diagnostic tests depending on available resources include measurement of TSH-receptor antibody, determination of radioactive \niodine uptake (RAIU), or measurement of thyroid blood flow on ultrasonography \nis needed.\n4 (Level III) If the diagnosis of GD is unclear, TSH receptor antibodies (TRAb) \nshould be measured.4 (Level III); 356 (Level III) They are sensitive and specific biomarkers for \nthe diagnosis of GD in childhood and reflect disease severity and activity.356 (Level III) \nThere is a positive correlation reported between serum TRAb and fT4 levels and significantly\thigher\tlevels\tin\tyoung\tchildren\t≤5\tyears\tof\tage.\n357 (Level II)\nMeasurement of TSH receptor antibodies may be useful in differentiating GD from the toxic phase of chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis and subacute thyroiditis.\n358 (Level III) \nHowever, TSH-receptor antibodies can be negative in mild or initial presentation of GD. A negative result may also be due to assay insensitivity. Other thyroid \nantibodies, antithyroglobulin and antithyroid peroxidases, are also often present \nbut are not specific in the diagnosis of GD. \nThyroid ultrasonography in GD usually shows a diffusely enlarged thyroid gland, \noften homogeneous.

First-line initial treatment is ATD, which is \ncarbimazole or its active metabolite methimazole (MMI). Propylthiouracil should \nbe avoided in children, except in selected circumstances, because of the risk of idiosyncratic liver failure. Methimazole/carbimazole dose typically used is  \n0.2–0.5 mg/kg daily, with a range from 0.1 mg/kg to 1.0 mg/kg daily.\n4\t(Level\tIII);359\t(Level III);\t\n360 (Level III) The initial starting dose is usually 0.5–1 mg/kg/day, with a maximal dose \nof 30 mg/day.361; 362 (Level III) Because most side effects of MMI are dose-related and \noccur within the first three months of treatment, high doses of MMI (>30 mg for an adolescent or adult) should rarely be used initially.\n4 (Level III); 361 (Level III); 362 (Level III) \nMethimazole/carbimazole could be administered once daily, which provides better compliance.\n4 (Level\tIII) Administration in divided doses has not been proven to be superior, \ncompared to once-daily dosing.

Indications for definitive \ntreatment in children include relapse after an appropriate duration of ATD, a lack \nof compliance on the part of the patient/caretakers or adverse effects of ATD. The issue of how long ATDs should be used in children before considering either RAI or surgery is controversial. \nThe American Thyroid Association 2016 guideline recommends paediatric patients \nwith GD, who are not in remission following at least 1–2 years of MMI/carbimazole, be considered for definitive treatment. Alternatively, MMI/carbimazole may also be used for longer duration if there are no adverse effects.\n4 (Level III) Patients and caretakers \nshould be counselled of the therapeutic options to make a best-informed decision. \nIn children, when ATDs are used for 1–2 years, remission rates reported are \ngenerally not high, that is, at around 20%–30% with remission defined as being euthyroid for one year after cessation of therapy.\n4 (Level I); 367 (Level II) However, a \nstudy from France had reported remission rates of 20%, 37%, 45%, and 49% after 4, 6, 8, and 10 years follow-up, respectively, of 154 children treated with \nATD.\n368 (Level II) Thus, while definitive therapy should be considered after 1–2 years \nof MMI, treatment for longer periods is also reasonable if ATD is tolerated. \nRetrospective studies have suggested that the chance of remission after two \nyears of ATDs is low if; the thyroid gland is large (more than 2.5 times the normal \nsize for age), the child is young (<12 years), prepubertal, or not Caucasian, has high serum TRAb levels on therapy and substantially elevated free T4 levels  \n(>4 ng/dL, 50 pmol/L) at diagnosis (Table 15).\n359 (Level III)\nTable 15: Predictors of poor remission (Adapted from 359 [Level III])\nPredictors of poor remission for children and adolescents with Graves’ disease\nLarge thyroid gland (>2.5x the normal size for age)\nYoung age <12 years\nPrepubertalNon-Caucasian\nHigh serum TRAb levels\nSignificantly elevated free T4 level (>50 pmol/L) at diagnosis"

Attempts to minimise the RAI activity will result in undertreatment and the possible need for additional RAI therapy and \nradiation exposure. The administered activity of RAI to patients with large goitres \nis high. The size of the gland may be underestimated, resulting in insufficient administration of RAI activities. Therefore, surgery may be preferable to RAI in children with goitres larger than 80 g.\n4 (Level III) \nPhysicians at some centres administer a fixed dose to all children, whereas others calculate the activity from estimation or direct measurement of gland size. To \nassess thyroid size, especially of a large gland, ultrasonography is recommended. \nThere is a lack of data comparing outcomes of fixed versus calculated activities in children. Advantage of calculated versus fixed dosing is that it may be possible \nto use lower administered activities of RAI and, at the same time, assure that an \nadequate administered activity is given. Radioactive iodine is excreted in saliva, \nurine, perspiration, tears, and stool. Significant radioactivity is retained within the thyroid for several days. It is therefore important that patients and families be informed of local radiation safety recommendations. \nAfter RAI therapy, T3, T4, and/or free T4 levels should be obtained every month. \nBecause TSH levels may remain suppressed for several months after correction \nof the hyperthyroid state, TSH determinations may not be useful. Hypothyroidism usually develops 2–3 months following successful RAI and should be treated with levothyroxine. \nSide effects of RAI therapy in children are uncommon apart from the lifelong \nhypothyroidism which is the goal of therapy. Less than 10% of children complain of tenderness over the thyroid in the first week after therapy, which can be treated with acetaminophen or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents for  \n24–48 hours.\n4(Level III) \nIf residual thyroid tissue remains in young children after RAI treatment, a theoretical risk of development of thyroid cancer exists. Increased rates of thyroid cancer \nand thyroid nodules were observed in young children exposed to radiation after \nHiroshima and the Chernobyl nuclear reactor explosion.\n4 (Level\tIII);\t359 (level III) The risk \nappeared to be age-dependent, greatest for children younger than 5–6 years of age and decreasing progressively through 12 years of age.\n359 (Level III) However, these data \ndo not apply directly when assessing the risks of RAI therapy. It is also important to note that iodine deficiency and exposure to radionuclides other than RAI may \nhave contributed to the increased risk of thyroid cancer in young children after \nthe Chernobyl reactor explosion.\n359 (Level III) Thyroid cancer rates were not increased \namong 3000 children exposed to RAI from the Hanford nuclear reactor site in an iodine-replete region.\n4 (Level III)"

In individuals with large thyroid glands (>80 g), the response to RAI may be \npoor and thus surgery may be preferable for these patients. When performed, a total or near-total thyroidectomy is the recommended procedure.\n4 (Level III) MMI is typically \ngiven for 1–2 months in preparation for thyroidectomy. Iodides block the release of thyroid hormones and reduce the vascularity of the thyroid gland. Potassium  \niodine (50 mg iodide/drop) can be given as 1–2 drops (i.e. 0.05–0.1 mL) three times daily for ten days before surgery. It can be mixed in juice or milk.\n4 (Level III)\nSurgical complication rates are higher in children than in adults. Younger children are at a higher risk for transient hypoparathyroidism post-thyroidectomy than adolescents or adults.\n372 (Level III); 373 (Level III); 374 (Level III) Calcium levels should be monitored \npostoperatively and treatment with calcitriol and calcium supplements may be needed. Postoperative hypocalcaemia requiring intravenous calcium infusions had \nbeen reported to occur more frequently in children than in adults. Complication \nrates are reported to be two-fold higher with surgeons without extensive experience.\n372(Level III) Further support that thyroidectomy for GD in children should \nbe performed by experienced thyroid surgeons comes from reports of institutional experience showing low complication rates at high-volume centres.\n374 (Level III)"

It contains approximately 37% iodine by weight. Because approximately \n10% of the molecule is deiodinated daily, and the maintenance daily dose of the drug \nranges from 200 to 600 mg, approximately 7–21 mg iodide is made available each day, resulting in a marked increase in urinary iodide excretion.

Amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis may develop early, late during \namiodarone treatment, or even many months after drug withdrawal, due to the slow release of amiodarone and its metabolites from the body stores. Occurrence of AIT between 5 and 16 months after stopping amiodarone has been reported. \nThus, periodical monitoring of thyroid function is warranted even after amiodarone \ndiscontinuation.\n415 (Level III); 4 (Level III); 416 (Level III)\n Recommendation\n •\t Monitor\t TFT\tbefore\tand\t3–4\tmonths\tafter\tstarting\tamiodarone\t and\tat\t \n3–6 months interval thereafter.

Type 1 AIT (AIT 1) is a form of iodine-induced hyperthyroidism caused by excessive, uncontrolled biosynthesis of thyroid hormone \nby autonomously functioning thyroid tissue in response to iodine load that typically \ndevelops in persons with underlying nodular goitre or latent Graves’ disease. Type 2 AIT (AIT 2) is a destructive thyroiditis occurring in an otherwise substantially normal thyroid gland. A mixed/indefinite type is also recognised where patients \nacquire an overlapping condition of both AIT 1 and AIT 2. Out of the two, AIT 2 \nis more prevalent in iodine-sufficient areas and, in general, is the most frequent form of AIT.\n414 (Level III) Identification of the different subtypes of AIT is crucial because \nthis affects the therapeutic approach. Thyroid ultrasonography may be useful as it shows the presence or absence of a diffuse or a nodular goitre. Colour flow Doppler \nultrasound study of the thyroid is perhaps more reliable. In AIT 2, most cases are \ncharacterised by absent hypervascularity, whereas in AIT 1 they usually show an increased vascularity and blood flow velocity.\n414 (Level III) Nuclear imaging using \nthyroidal 131I uptake (RAIU) is another useful diagnostic tool. The results of RAIU are usually very low (<3%) in AIT 2 and low–normal, normal, or even increased in AIT \n1. Other tracers such as 99m pertechnetate (99mTcO4) and 99mTcO4 2-methoxy-\nisobutyl-isonitrile (MIBI) have also been used.\n414 (Level III); 413 (Level III)"

In a  \nrandomised controlled study that compared treatment groups in AIT 2 with prednisolone alone, perchlorate alone and combination prednisolone and \nperchlorate, prednisolone treatment resulted in euthyroidism in all patients, while \n30% of the patients treated with sodium perchlorate alone needed additional prednisolone treatment to become euthyroid.\n417 (Level I) An earlier retrospective \nobservation showed that a six-week treatment of 42 AIT 2 patients with methimazole alone resulted in euthyroidism in 15% of patients compared to 76% of the patients treated with prednisolone alone.\n414 (Level III); 418 (Level III) The suggested dose of \ncorticosteroids in this setting is equivalent to 40 mg prednisolone given once daily for 2–4 weeks, followed by a gradual taper over 2–3 months, based on the patient’s clinical response.\n4 (Level III)\nMixed or indefinite form of AIT: If a precise diagnosis cannot be made, two possible approaches can be proposed. The first one is to start with thionamides (± sodium perchlorate) as for AIT 1 and, in the absence of a biochemical improvement within a relatively short period of time (4–6 weeks), to add glucocorticoids with the assumption \nthat a destructive component is also present superimposed on an underlying \nthyroid disorder. An alternative approach is represented by a combined treatment (thionamides and glucocorticoids) from the very beginning.\n414 (Level III)) Evidence is \nlacking on the best therapeutic strategy for mixed/indefinite AIT, and randomised clinical trials are warranted. One study had looked at the use of lithium in AIT but the effectiveness is limited and has not been confirmed.\n414 (Level III) Radioiodine treatment \nis usually not feasible due to the low thyroidal iodine uptake.415 (Level III) Patients \nwith AIT who fail to respond to medical therapy should be offered thyroidectomy  \nbefore they become excessively debilitated from inadequately controlled thyrotoxicosis.\n4 (Level III) A retrospective study on 24 patients who failed medical \ntherapy for AIT underwent total thyroidectomy and the outcome was improved cardiac function in AIT patients with severe LV dysfunction with no mortality.\n419 (Level III) \nThere is neither consensus nor sufficient evidence concerning the decision to either continue or stop amiodarone in AIT patients. Continuing amiodarone may increase the recurrence rate of thyrotoxicosis, causing a delay in the stable restoration of \neuthyroidism and a longer exposure of the heart to thyroid hormone excess.\n420 (Level III) \nThe decision to continue or stop amiodarone should be individualised and taken \njointly by specialist cardiologists and endocrinologists.

Decompression surgery: Minimally invasive approach is preferred. Decompressing \nsurgery aims to reduce intraocular pressure by enlarging the bony orbit with \ndifferent degrees of extension of medial/lateral orbital walls or removal of \nthe orbital floor. Fat excision via the inferolateral or inferomedial extraconal compartments is another alternative. Orbital decompression can reduce exophthalmos, periorbital puffiness, and lid retraction as well as reduce the \nintraocular pressure and thereby relieve retro-orbital pain. This procedure can \nalso improve strabismus and cure postural visual obscuration in patients with orbital and optic nerve microvasculopathy. Potential complications of orbital decompression are new onset/worsening strabismus and globe dystopia.\n474(Level II)\n2. Strabismus/squint surgery: It aims to restore fusion in primary position avoiding diplopia in downward gaze and to correct residual incomitances.\n475(Level II) \n3. Eyelid surgery: Medical therapies such as alpha-blocker eye drops or post-ganglia adrenergic blockers are not very effective or limited by side effects. Botulinum injection is effective but transient. There are many approaches to  \nlid retraction surgeries (from mild to severe degree of upper lid retraction), such as sutureless mullerectomy, transconjuctival free en block recession of the levator palpebrae superioris muscle and conjunctiva, or transcutaneous blepharotomy.\n474,476(Level II)\n4.

The updated, revised section is as below; \n7.1.3  Is Maternal OH/SCHypo Associated With Adverse Maternal/  \nFoetal Outcomes?\nMaternal OH has consistently been shown to be associated with adverse \npregnancy outcomes, including pregnancy loss, pre-eclampsia, low birth weight (LBW), intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and impaired foetal neurocognitive development.\n237 (Level II); 238 (Level II); 239 (Level II) A prospective cohort study in India \ndemonstrated more than seven times increased risk of intrauterine death while another prospective cohort study in China demonstrated more than thirteen times \nincreased risk of foetal loss among pregnant women with OH compared to the \neuthyroid control.\n237 (Level II); 238 (Level II) \nThe associations between maternal SCHypo and adverse pregnancy outcomes have \nbeen less robust than maternal OH. This is partly due to the variable TSH cut-offs \nused in different studies and many studies did not take into account the influence of thyroid autoimmunity (TAI) or thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPO Ab) positivity on the outcome.\n240 (Level II); 241 (Level II); 242 (Level II) The adverse outcomes that were most \nconsistently reported to be associated with maternal SCHypo included pregnancy loss and preterm delivery.\n243 (Level II); 244 (Level II); 245 (Level II); 246 (Level II); Consortium on Thyroid and Pregnancy \n2019 (Level II)* Van den Boogard E et al. also reported an increased risk of pre-eclampsia \namong pregnant women with SCHypo while Chan et al. reported increased risk \nof placental abruption and breech presentation and Maraka et al. reported  \nincreased risk of premature ruptured of membrane (PROM) and placental abruption in their respective meta-analyses.\n243 (Level II); 244 (Level II); 245 (Level II) The association between \nimpaired intellectual development in the offspring with maternal SCHypo has been shown to be present in some studies but absent in others.\n247 (Level II); 238 (Level II); 248 (Level II) \nThe association between maternal SCHypo and adverse pregnancy outcomes were \noften exacerbated by the presence of TPO Ab.249\t(Level\tII);\t250\t(Level\tII);\t251\t(Level\tII);\t252\t(Level\tII);\t246\t(Level II) \nIn a prospective cohort study involving 5971 singleton pregnancies, the association \nbetween maternal SCHypo and preterm delivery was lost after exclusion of women \nwith TPO Ab positivity or co-morbidities. However, those with high TSH (defined as \n>4.04 mIU/L) and positive TPO Ab was found to have more than three times increased risk of preterm delivery.\n250 (Level II) A prospective cohort study in China showed that the \nincreased risk of miscarriage occurred at a lower TSH threshold among the pregnant women with concomitant SCHypo and TAI at 2.5 mIU/L compared to 5.2 mIU/L for \nwomen with isolated SCHypo without TAI.\n251 (Level II) Similarly, a meta-analysis on nine \ncohort studies comparing the prevalence of miscarriage among pregnant women \nwith SCHypo to the euthyroid pregnant women showed that the presence of TAI"

        "text": "CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES \nMANAGEMENT OF THYROID DISORDERS147increased the risk of miscarriage by 2.5 times among pregnant women with SCHypo \ncompared to isolated SCH without TAI.246 (Level II)\nSummary\n• Maternal OH has been consistently shown to be associated with adverse \npregnancy outcomes, including pregnancy loss, pre-eclampsia, preterm delivery, LBW, IUGR and impaired foetal neurocognitive development.\n• The adverse outcomes that were most consistently reported to be associated with maternal SCHypo include pregnancy loss and preterm delivery.\n• These associations were dependent on the maternal TPO Ab status with a lower \nTSH threshold (TSH at or above 2.5 mIU/L) among the TPO Ab positive women \nversus a higher TSH threshold (TSH >5 mIU/L) among the TPO Ab negative women.\n7.1.4 What Is the Impact of TPO Ab Positivity on Euthyroid Women or Women \nWith Subclinical Hypothyroidism in Pregnancy? \nThe presence of TAI has been consistently shown to be associated with pregnancy \nloss and preterm delivery independent of maternal thyroid function in various meta analyses.\n243 (Level II); 253 (Level II); 254 (Level II); Consortium on Thyroid and Pregnancy 2019 (Level II)*\nMost studies defined the presence of TAI by TPO Ab positivity while others defined it as TPO and or thyroglobulin (Tg) Ab positivity. The risk was exacerbated in the presence of maternal TSH of more than 2.5 mIU/L.\n251 (Level II) The association between \nTPO Ab positivity and recurrent miscarriages was less robust with only two studies reporting an association.\n255 (Level II); 243 (Level II) Lower intellectual development scores \nof offspring have also been shown to be associated with TPO Ab positivity in two retrospective cohort studies but the evidence is weak.\n247 (Level II); 256 (Level II) A meta-\nanalysis of 38 studies examining clinical significance of TAI before conception and in early pregnancy also showed an increased risk of sub-fertility and postpartum \nthyroiditis.\n243 (Level II)\nSummary\n• The presence of TAI is associated with pregnancy loss and preterm delivery \nindependent of maternal thyroid function. This is predominantly driven by the \npresence of TPO Ab positivity. \n• The risk was exacerbated in the presence of maternal TSH of >2.5 mIU/L.\n7.1.5 Does Treatment With Levothyroxine (LT4) Improve Adverse Outcomes Associated With Maternal Overt/Subclinical Hypothyroidism?\nLevothyroxine treatment for pregnant women with OH is highly recommended, \nalthough no prospective randomised control trial (RCT) has been conducted to \nprove its benefits. This is because of the numerous serious adverse maternal and"

It \nwould be unethical to withhold treatment in this population to perform an RCT. LT4 replacement in pregnancy is particularly essential in the first 18 to 20 weeks of \ngestation where foetal thyroid hormones depends largely on the placental transfer \nof maternal thyroxine.\nFor maternal SCHypo, the benefits of LT4 treatment are not as clear-cut as OH. \nWhile there have been many studies that demonstrated the associations of \nmaternal SCHypo with adverse pregnancy outcomes, especially pregnancy loss and \npreterm delivery, only a small number of studies demonstrated the benefits of LT4 treatment in this population. A prospective, non-randomised open-labelled study on maternal SCHypo demonstrated that the increased risk of spontaneous abortion \namong SCHypo patients not given LT4 treatment compared to controls with normal \nTSH was eliminated with LT4 treatment.\n257 (Level II) A retrospective study on the United \nStates national cohort demonstrated significant risk reduction in pregnancy loss with LT4 treatment among pregnant women with SCHypo when the serum TSH was \nimproved to less than 4.0 mIU/L.\n258 (Level II) Similarly, a meta-analysis of nine cohort \nstudies showed normalisation of an increased miscarriage risk associated with \nmaternal SCHypo upon LT4 treatment compared to that of euthyroid women.246 (Level II) \nA recent randomised controlled trial showed that LT4 treatment reduced the risk of preterm delivery among a group of TPO Ab negative women with TSH above \n4 mIU/L.\n259 (Level I) However, no study has specifically assessed whether the presence \nof TPO Ab positivity will lower the serum TSH threshold in obtaining risk reduction \non miscarriage and preterm delivery.\nTwo RCTs examining the effect of LT4 replacement in maternal SCHypo or isolated \nhypothyroxinaemia had failed to show any benefits in the improvement of IQ scores in the offspring.\n260 (Level I); 261 (Level I) \n Recommendations\n •\t Pregnant\twomen\twith\tOH\tshould\tbe\ttreated\twith\tLT4\n •\t For\tmaternal\t SCHypo,\t LT4\ttreatment\t should\tbe\tconsidered\t in\tthe\tfollowing\t\nsituations to reduce the risk of miscarriage and preterm delivery:\n a) pregnant women with negative TPOAb: \n\t \t – LT4\tis\trecommended\tif\tTSH\tis\t>10\tmIU/L\n\t \t – \t LT4\tmay\tbe\tconsidered\t if\tTSH\tis\tabove\tthe\tpregnancy\t specific\treference\t\nrange or 4.0 mIU/L\n b) pregnant women with positive TPOAb:\n\t \t – \t LT4\tis\trecommended\t if\tTSH\tis\tabove\tthe\tpregnancy\t specific\treference\t\nrange or 4.0 mIU/L\n\t \t – LT4\tmay\tbe\tconsidered\tif\tTSH\tis\t>2.5\tmIU/L\n •\t LT4\ttreatment\t is\tnot\tindicated\t to\timprove\tthe\tIQ\tscores\tof\toffsprings\t to\tmothers\t\nwith SCHypo"

        "text": "CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES \nMANAGEMENT OF THYROID DISORDERS1497.1.6 Does Treatment With LT4 Improve Adverse Outcomes Associated With \nTPO Ab Positivity?\nWhile TPO Ab positivity has been shown to be associated with pregnancy loss \nand preterm delivery independent of maternal thyroid status, the benefits of LT4 replacement in reducing the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes among TPO Ab positive women has yet to be established. The first prospective randomised controlled trial looking at the effect of LT4 treatment among euthyroid women with \nTAI showed significant risk reduction in miscarriage and preterm delivery with LT4 \ntreatment.\n262 (Level I) However, a relatively high TSH cut-off of 4.4 mIU/L was used to \ndefine euthyroid in that study. Results from subsequent retrospective studies have yielded mixed results.\n263 (Level II);264 (Level II) Another recent RCT demonstrated significant \nrisk reduction in preterm delivery but not miscarriage rate among a group of TPO Ab positive women without overt thyroid dysfunction.\n265 (Level I) However, the benefits \nwere predominantly driven by those with TSH of 4 mIU/L and above. The TABLET trial also failed to show any benefits in improving live birth rates among euthyroid \nwomen with positive TPO Ab associated with history of miscarriage or infertility \ndespite being commenced on LT4 before conception.\nDhillon-Smith 2019* \nThe evidence available to date is therefore insufficient to recommend routine LT4 \ntreatment in euthyroid pregnant women with positive TPO Ab. \n Recommendations\n •\t There\t is\tinsufficient\t evidence\t to\trecommend\t routine\tLT4\ttreatment\t in\teuthyroid\t\nwomen with positive TPO Ab in pregnancy.\n7.1.9 Who Should Be Screened for Maternal Hypothyroidism?\n Recommendations\n •\t The\tcurrent\tlevel\tof\tevidence\t does\tnot\tsupport\tuniversal\t screening\t for\tmaternal\t\nhypothyroidism  \n •\t TSH\ttesting\tshould\tbe\tperformed\t for\twomen\twho\tare\ttrying\tto\tconceive\t or\tas\t\nsoon as pregnancy is confirmed if the following risk factors are present: \n i.
