However, the lists of compounded \nitems in this manual are not exhaustive. Preparations included in the manual \nare for ingredients available commercially but not in the required dosage \nform for therapy and thus, necessitate extemporaneous preparations.\nThe committee has made all reasonable efforts to confirm the accuracy of \nthe information contained in the manual and to present the best practices as \nidentified at the time of its completion. Formulations are only included where \nthere is existence of published formulations and associated stability data.\nThe use of this manual requires knowledge based interpretation by healthcare \nprofessionals and is intended solely for use by pharmacists in healthcare \nfacilities. All information contained in the manual has been provided with the \nsole intention that it be readily accessible for pharmacist’s information and as \na guide for preparing extemporaneous preparations that may be prescribed.\nOBJECTIVE\nTo standardise formulations of extemporaneous preparations and practice in \nhealthcare facilities."

        "text": "2\nPOLICY\n1. Always consider the use of commercially available products as far as \npossible. \n2. If no suitable commercial product exists, consider a therapeutic \nalternative that is available in a suitable dosage form. This must be \ndiscussed with the physician. \n3. Extemporaneous preparations should be done based on evidence-based \nreferences. \n4. Always check for the suitability of the product/brand for extemporaneous \npreparations.\n5. Preparations listed in this manual should be done according to what is \nstated as far as possible unless stated otherwise in the product leaflet.\n6. When no information is available, compound an oral medication by \ndispensing a tablet and/or capsule and directing the caregiver to mix just \nprior to administration. \n7. Stability stated in this manual is applicable for shelf storage in the pharmacy \nwithout opening. Once opened, the stability of the preparation should \nbe no longer than 30 days. Maximum quantity of the extemporaneous \npreparations to be dispensed should not exceed one month.\n8. Refrain assumptions on the therapeutic equivalence in the case of \nsuggesting alternative agents as the possibilities and supporting data \nmay be limited. \n9. Techniques in compounding preparations and manipulations should \nalways be in line with the standard Good Preparation Practice as delivering \nan accurate dose is paramount. \n10. Staff and facilities are challenged to undertake intermittent competency \nassessments in order to achieve the standards requirement. \n11. Documentation after each preparation should include details on the \nmaterials used, processes involved and the responsible personnel in \ncharge."

        "text": "3\nCONSIDERATIONS FOR PREPARING EXTEMPORANEOUS COMPOUNDS\n1. Pharmacy personnel are reminded not to empirically change flavourings \nor suspending agents because they can affect the pH and stability of the \nproduct and result in an unstable product.\n2. Please consider ingredients in the formulations that require special \nprecautions in neonates.\n3. Mixing of a compounded formulation should always be in line with the \nfollowing principles:\na. Ensure that all ingredients used are within the expiry date. \nb. Ensure that all utensils are clean; including mortar and pestle, \ngraduates, pill cutters and stirring rods. \nc. Product should be labelled clearly and stored as recommended \nwithin the formula. \nd. For solution or suspension products, emphasise on the importance \nof thorough shaking before administration. \n4. If compounding a preparation using contents from an ampoule, \nremember to withdraw the solution (medication) from the ampoule \nusing a filter needle to ensure no glass particles are incorporated into \nthe compound. \n5. Place tablet(s) within mortar and pestle to grind tablets to a fine powder. \nFor film-coated tablets, it may be necessary to add a small amount of \ndiluents such as water, to soften the coating prior to grinding the tablets. \nThis will ensure that the compound will not have an eggshell appearance \nfrom the film coating floating throughout the suspension. If you are using \ncapsules, open the capsule and empty the powder into the mortar and \ndiscard the capsule shell. \n6. Solutions will have a clearer appearance versus a compounded \nsuspension."

        "text": "4\n7. Manipulations of the available dosage forms in order to fulfil the \nunusual practitioner’s request may impose risks such as preparation \nand administration errors as well as unpredictable bioavailability, \ncompatibility and stability profile. \n8. Understand the roles of excipients in certain formulations and consider \ntheir risks over benefits limitation.\n9. If distilled water is not available, water for injection can be used as a \nsubstitution, and vice versa."
