        "text": "v FOREWORD   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOne in two smokers will eventually die as a result of their addiction to nicotine in \nMalaysia. In absolute numbers, more than 20,000 Malaysians die annually as a \nresult of their smoking habit. It is estimated that 43.0% of men and 1.4% of \nwomen, above the age of 15, smoke in Malaysia. These figures are still alarmingly \nhigh and more needs to be done to help smokers to quit, espec ially if Malaysia is \nto achieve the global World Health Organization Non -Communicable Diseases \n(WHO NCD) target to achieve smoking prevalence of 15% by the year 2025.  \n \nWe have now reached a point where the majority of smokers are aware that \nsmoking is not good for their health but have difficulty quitting. Globally and \nnationally, the majority of current smokers would like to give up smoking. As a \nparty to the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), Malaysia \nis committed to strengthen the smokin g cessation services, as stipulated in Article \n14 FCTC. Hence, this Clinical Practice Guideline was developed to ensure \nsmokers gets the latest evidenced -based treatment there are to ensure higher \nquit smoking success rate. Helping our fellow Malaysian smo kers to beat their \nnicotine addiction is beneficial for both short and long -term personal and national \ngains. Last but not least, I would like to thank the CPG committee members and \nmany others that have contributed to the development of this CPG.  \n \nTowards  a healthy and smokefree Malaysian generation ! \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(DATUK SERI DR.

        "text": "vi FOREWORD   \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNicotine addiction is one of the hardest addictions to break but nonetheless, every \nyear, many smokers managed to break away from this addiction. However, a \nnational survey in 2016 revealed that nearly 80% of former smokers quit unaided, \nwithout any profes sional intervention. This figure is worrying, as studies \nrepeatedly show that quitting unaided yield the lowest success rate of being \nsmokefree, hence many smokers needed 7 -8 attempts before successfully \nbecoming  ex-smokers.  \n \nMost government Health Clinics and major hospitals in Malaysia have smoking \ncessation services and now, with the introduction of mQuit Services, this service \nis also available in the private sector, through some community pharmacies, \ngeneral practices or other institutions. Our challenge now is how to attract  fellow \nMalaysians who smoke to visit our smoking cessation services and deliberate on  \nhow they can be guided to quit properly. Smoking cessation services should \nentice as many smokers as possible, who are otherwise coming to  health care \nfacilities for other health services anyway.  \n \nA national survey conducted in 2016 among Malaysian adolescents aged 10 ‚Äì 19 \nyears old (Tobacco and Electronic Cigarette Survey among Malaysian Adolescent \n‚Äì TECMA) found that an alarming 78.7% of e ver smokers had their first cigarette \nbefore the age of 14 year s old. The same study also show that 28.5% of the \ncurrent adolescent smokers have already developed low nicotine dependence. \nMore often than not, their nicotine dependence will only get stronge r by the time \nthey enter their working life.  \n \nTherefore, it is high time for healthcare providers to promote and attract young \nadult smokers to think about quitting and to at least discuss about quitting with the \nhelp of healthcare professionals. Our data showed that young adults are the least \nlikely to enquire about quitting, while their tobacco disorder is probably easier to \ntreat in comparison to older and more mature smokers. Our smoking cessation \nservices must do more to appeal to younger Malaysian smo kers to come to the \nservices."

        "text": "viii EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  \n \nTobacco use is recognized as the main cause  of premature and preventable death \nin our  country. It is estimated that 2 0,000 deaths in Malaysi a are attributed to \nsmoking annual ly. Tobacco dependency does not only cause physical withdrawal, \nit also causes lifelong addiction. Hence, due recognition should be given to it as \na chronic disease. Malaysia has a high prevalence of smokers especially among \nthe males and adolescents. Howe ver, despite the high prevalence of tobacco use, \nhealthcare providers are not well trained to manage this problem effectively. \nFurthermore , health care providers lack the knowledge and awareness that \ntreating tobacco dependence is more cost effective as co mpared to treating \ntobacco related diseases.  \n \nSince  the launch  of the Clinical Practice  Guideline  (CPG) on Treatment of \nTobacco Use and Dependence 2003 by  the Ministry of Health, there have been \nseveral new  evidences  based  development s in the smoking cessation services  \nwhich are highlighted in this update . For example, t here are changes or \nintroduction of new cessation pharmaceutical aid s, combination use of \npharmaceutical aids , new scientific evidence of beha vioural therap ies and now \nthe emergence  of electronic nicotine and non -nicotine devices, such as Vape. The \napproach towards tobacco use or nicotine addiction has also changed whereby  it \nis now considered a medical condition that requires medical attention. Hence, it is \nvery timely for the 2003 CPG to be updated to the  CPG of Tobacco Use and \nDisorder 2016.  \n \nThe objective of this CPG remains the same . It is to provide the latest and updated \ntreatment protocols to assist health care providers in managing tobacco use and \ndependence effectively.  \n \nThis guideline wa s based on a combination of two methods . The first part was \nwhere three leading and prominent international CPGs on tobacco cessation  were \nused as references  and the second was  inclusion of  the latest literature based on \na systematic search of the evidence. All recommendations in this CPG  are  \ngraded  based  on  the  appropriate  level  of  evidence  and  are  specific  and \nunambiguous.  The health benefits, adverse effects and risks of all recommended \npharmacological agents are detailed in tab les throughout this document . The \noverall treatment guideline is provided in a clinical pathway format. Furthermore, \nthe effectiveness and health benefits derived from each recommendation in this \nCPG are taken into consideration.  \n \nBoth non -pharmacological and pharmacological approaches towards achieving \nsmoking cessation are equally important and the skills involved must be grasped \nby cessation providers. There are several standardised behavioural approaches \nsuch as 5A, 5R and STAR to help cessation provide rs to assist their clients.  When \nthese behavioural approaches are combined  with pharmacological intervention ,"

Combination pharmacological intervention s \nwhich might include the  combination of NRT s or with a  non-NRT medication can \nfurther increase the success rate.  Therefore, the treatment approach should be \ntailored to  the individual  smoker  and care be given when treating certain special \npopulation s. \n \nIt is hoped that clinicians and other allied healthcare p roviders will adopt this \nevidence ‚Äì based guideline to maximize the success rate of tobacco cessation  in \ntheir respective services . This CPG , however,  is not meant as a substitute for \nclinical judgement and clinicians are recommended to individualize their  treatment \nstrategies  where appropriate . \n \nEvaluation of this CPG would include  an assessment of the number of smoking  \ncessation services and the outcome of smokers treated throughout Malaysia. \nStudies to look at improvement in standard of practice regarding smoking \ncessation treatment will be conducted.  Local research and analysis of Malaysian \nsmoking and tobacco use sce nario should be encouraged to improve our \nunderstanding towards improving the smoking cessation in our country."

There was active involvement of a \nmultidisciplinary Review Committee (RC) during the process of the CPG \ndevelopment.  \n \nA litera ture search was carried out using the following electronic databases: \nGuidelines International Network (G -I-N); Medline via Ovid, PubMed and \nCochrane Database of Systemic Reviews (CDSR) (refer to Appendix 1 for \nExample of Search Strategy). The inclusion cr iteria are all literature on tre atment \non tobacco use disorder regardless of study design s. The search was limited to \nliterature published in the last 15 years, humans and English. In addition, the \nreference lists of all retrieved literature and guidelines  were searched to further \nidentify relevan t studies. Experts in the field were also contacted to identify \nrelevant studies. In certain situations, pivotal papers beyond the scope of search \nwere used in the CPG. All searches were  conducted from 30th July 20 14 to 30th \nMarch 2016. Literature searches were repeated for all clinical questions at the \nend of the CPG development process allowing any relevant papers published \nbefore 30th June 2016  to be included. Future CPG updates will consider evidence \npublished a fter this cut -off date. The details of the search strategy can be obtained \nupon request from the CPG Secretariat."

The literature retrieved was appraised by at least two DG members \nusing Critical Appraisal Skill Programme checklist, presented in evidence tables \nand further discussed in e ach DG meetings. All statements and recommendations \nformulated after that were a greed upon by the DG . Where evidence was \ninsufficient, the recommendations were ma de by consensus of the DG . Any \ndifferences in opinion were resolved consensually. The CPG was based largely \non the findings of systematic reviews, meta -analyses and clinical trials, with local \npractices taken into consideration.  \n \nOn completion, the draft of the CPG was reviewed by external reviewers.

In \nMalaysia, s moking kills 20,000 Malaysians every year and will increase to 30,000 \nby the year 2020 if the pat tern of smoking does not change . \n \nMalaysia is a party to the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO \nFCTC) since its enforcement in September 2005. Article 14 of the WHO FCTC \ndemand s that ‚Äúeach Party shall develop and disseminate appropriate, \ncomprehensive and integrated  guideline s based on scientific evidence and best \npractices, taking into account national  circumstances and priorities, and shall take \neffective measures to promote cessation of tobacco  use and adequate treatment \nfor tobacco dependence‚Äù.  Strengthening tobacco cessat ion is core to the ‚ÄòO - Offer \nhelp to quit tobacco use‚Äô  component of the MPOWER strategy of the WHO FCTC \n2, Level I. \n \nMalaysia is committed to achieve its WHO Global NCD Target 2025, which is to \nreduce national smoking prevalence by 30% from the baseline in 2011. There are \ntwo main strategies to achieve this, which  are to reduce smoking initiation among \nyouths and to help existing smokers to beat their nicotine addiction.  \n \nA National Strategic Plan on Tobacco Control has been developed by the Ministry \nof Health in 2015, incorporating the MPOWER strategy for co-ordinating tobacco in \nMalaysia3, Level I II. Strengthening tobacco cessation services is given priority, with \ndevelopment of a standardised services a cross the public and private practices ‚Äì \n‚Äòthe mQuit Services‚Äô as one the activities. This Clinical Practice Guideline is \nessential for delivery of uniformed tobacco cessation services through the mQuit \nServices.  \n \nNicotine is highly addictive and some resea rchers have placed nicotine dependence \nas comparable to the dependence caused by opiates, cocaine, or other illicit drugs4, \nLevel I. Effective pharmacologic and counselling strategies are now the pillars of \ntobacco cessation program mes, and taken in combinat ion can achieve the highest \nrates of smoking cessation5, Level I II. Pharmacotherapy  for smoking cessation aims \nprimarily  to reduce the intensity of urges to smoke and/or  ameliorate the aversive \nsymptoms while counselling or behavioural  support aims to boost or support \nmotivation to  resist the urge to smoke and develop peop le‚Äôs capacity to implement \ntheir plans to avoid  smoking6, Level I II.  \n \nMost smokers believe that stopping smoking is purely a matter of willpower and \nremain unaware of effective treatments to promote quitting. It is important that \nhealth care providers whom often treat smokers to be familiar with available \ntherapies to educate pat ients of their options for smoking cessation."

The \nidentification of smokers itself increases rates of clinician intervention. Hospitals \nprovide a good setting to implement smoking cessation intervention. However \nissues of ac cessibility and availability of the medication, dedicated staff, operating \ndays and equipment have  to be solved11, 12. Effective identification of tobacco use \nstatus not only opens the door for successful interventions (e.g., clinician advice \nand treatment), but als o guides clinicians to identify appropriate interventions based \non patients‚Äô tobacco use status and willingness to quit. The Guidelin e recommends \nthat all health care providers use the opportunity at every encounter to assess and \nintervene all patients.  \n \nThe assessments are to look for:  \n \nLevel of addiction (using Modified Fagerstr√∂m Test  for Cigarette Dependence \nQuestionnaire ) (See Appendix  3) and smoking status verified with carbon mono xide \n(CO) in expired breath air.  Exhaled CO was proved to be a useful tool in predicting \nnicotine dependence and to motivate smo kers to quit13, Level I.    \n \nScreening for current or past tobacco use will result in four possible responses:  \n \nA. The patient uses tobacco and is now willing to make a quit attempt;  \nB. The patient uses tobacco but is now not willing to make a quit attempt;  \nC. The patient once used tobacco but has since quit;  \nD. The patient never regularly used tobacco."

They are:  \n \ni. Brief clinical intervention  \n \nii. Intensive clinical intervention  \n \n4.1 Brief Clinical Intervention for Tobacco Use Disorder  \n \n4.1.1  For All Smokers  \n \nBrief clinical intervention by the physician increases quit rates effectively14, Level I. It \nis vital to change clinical culture and practice patterns to ensure that every patient \nwho uses tobacco is identified and offered treatment.  \n \nThe five major steps (5 A‚Äôs) for intervention are described below and summarised  \nin Table 1. The strategies are designed to be brief and minimal health care \nprovider‚Äôs time is required15,16,17. \n \nThese brief opportunistic advices  typically involve  asking patients about their current \nsmoking, advising them to stop, offering assistance either by providing further \nadvice, a referral to a specialist service or recommendation of or a prescription for \npharmacotherapy or arranging a follow up wherever it is appropriate.  The focus of \nthis opportunistic advice is to increase smokers‚Äô motivation to quit in improving \nsucce ss rate of quitting18. This brief intervention has been proven to increase overall \ntobacco abstinence rates regardless he or she is referred to an intensive \nintervention19,20  Level I, 21 Level I II.  \n \nThe steps involved in the delivery of brief intervention include:  \n \nStep 1: Ask about tobacco smoking  \n \nALL patients should be asked  about their smoking status and the findings should \nbe documented in the patient‚Äôs notes. This should be delivered opportunistically \nduring routine consultations to all smokers regardless whether they are seeking help \nto stop smoking. For people who smoke or have recently stopped smoking, the \nsmoking status should be checked and updated at every visit  to prevent relapse . \nSystems should be in place in all health care settings to ensure that smoking status \nis accur ately documented at every visit (20,  Level I ; 6,  Level I)"

        "text": "5 Step 2: Advice to quit  \n \nAdvice  to quit should be given clearly to  all patients found to be smoking. Studies \nhave shown that advise by health care providers (medical, dental, pharmacist, \nnurses etc.) increases rates of abstinence. There is a strong dose -response  \nrelationship  between  the  session  length  of  person -to-person  contact  and \nsuccessful  treatm ent  outcomes20, Level I.  \n \nMultiple efforts by health care providers can increase these rates further. Every \ntobacco user should be offered at least a brief intervention which consists of brief \ncessation advice from the health care providers. However, intensive interventions \nare mor e effective than brief interventions and should be used whenever possible \nas smokers‚Äô motivation, beliefs and feeling about smoking and quitting is always \nconflicting18, Level I II. Face to face treatment delivered for four or more sessions \nappears especially effective in increasing abstinence rates22, Level I. Therefore, if \nfeasible, treatment providers should strive to meet four or more times with \nindividuals quitting tobacco use.  \n \nHealth care workers should be provided with appropriate training to enable them to \nprovide brief  advice. This training should include providing the health care worker \nwith information on available evidence -based smoking cessation treatments19. \n \n \nStep 3: Assess w illingness to make a quit attempt  \n \nHealth care providers involved with tobacco treatment should assess  the \nwillingness to begin treatment to quit.  \n \nThough there is a lack of evidence for greater effectiveness of stage based \napproache s23, Level I, stages of  change model provides a useful framework to help \nhealth care providers to identify smokers and assist smokers in quitting24, Level I II.  \n \nThere is some evidence that the likelihood of success in an attempt to quit is \nunrelated to the smoker‚Äôs expressed interest in quitting in the period leading up to \nthe attempt ‚Äì unplanned attempts to quit are as likely (or even more likely) to be as \nsuccessful as planne d attempts25, Level I II; 26, Level I II. Thus, there is benefit in \nencouraging all smokers to consider quitting whenever the opportunity arises20, Level \nI.  \n \nStep 4: Assist in quit attempt  \n \nAll patients should be assisted  to quit. Brief advice as short as 30 seconds and self -\nhelp material have been shown to help14, Level I. Brief advice  (3-5 minutes) is effective \nand there is a dose response in treatment provision."

Ideally the quit date should be \nwithin 2 weeks  on assessment to quit.  \n \n‚Ä¢ Individual, group and telephone counselling approa ches are effective and \nshould be used in smoking cessation interventions. Smoking cessation \ninterventions that are delivered in multiple approaches increase abstinence \nrates and should be encouraged. Studies have shown that individual \ncounselling resulted in higher abstinence rates as compared to group or \nphone counselling and self -help27, Level I I-1; 22, Level I. There are two forms of \ntelephone counselling which is the ‚Äòproactive counse lling‚Äô and ‚Äòreactive \ncounselling. In proactive counselling, smokers receive calls from healthcare \nproviders according to a pre -agreed schedule. In ‚Äòreactive counselling ‚Äô, \nsmokers calls a helpline seeking help or advice.

For hospitalised patients, a  study ha s \nshown that high intensive telephone follow -up (4 calls at 48 hours post \ndischarge, 7, 21, 90 da ys) was more effective than low intensive follow -up (1 \ncall at 48 hours post discharge) in addition to 30 minutes counselling30, Level I.  \n \n \nStep 5: Arrange follow up \n \nHealth care providers wanting to do more intensive counselling will require further \nappropriate training. Health care providers who are not confident in providing \ncounselling  interventions can still assist  patients wanting to quit by arranging  \nreferral s to services that can assist.  \n \nPatients who are attempting to quit are at high risk of relapsing . Continuous \nabstinence is achieved when the patient has not smoked for at least 6 months. The \nhighest risk of relapse is within the first 8 days of quitting. Hence the support has to \nbe given the utmost importance in the first week of quitting cigarette smoking. \nEvidence has shown that abstinence of 12 months follow up is a good indicator for \nlong term abstinence31. \n \nThe evidence sugge sts that multiple treatment sessions increase smoking \nabstinence rate and its effectiveness. More intensive interventions (more than eight \nsessions in six months) may produce enhanced abstinence rate.

The American Psychiatry Association (APA) also recommends \nthat psychiatrists assess the smoking status of all patients, including readiness to \nquit, previous quitting history and level of nicotine dependence116, Level II -2. Therefore,  \nit is important that ALL patients be asked to quit when seen in psychiatri c services.  \n \nDespite the very good and extensive database on the safety and efficacy of \npharmacological treatment of tobacco dependence, only a few studies have \nexamined their use in men tally ill patients.

Special \nconsideration should be given to the degree of dependence, number of cigarettes per \nday, and body weight.  \n \nHealthcare providers in a paediat ric setting should offer smoking cessation advice and \ninterventions to parents or guardians to limit children‚Äôs exposure to second -hand \nsmoke20, Level  I. \n \nYouth smokers of today are likely to become re gular smokers of tomorrow . It is \nestimated that 90% of smokers start smoking before the age of  18. In Malaysia, 71% \nof adolescent  smokers tried their first cigarette before the age of 14 year old141, Level III. \nHence it is important to reduce the amount of tobacco use (including nicotine use in \nelectronic cigarettes) among youth so as to decrease the rate of nicotine dependence \nand subsequent morbidity and mort ality in future adults142, Level II -3. Early intervention \nof thei r nicotine dependence will increase the likelihood of them not becoming adult \nsmokers.  \n \nAdolescents are likely to model parents‚Äô behaviour and adopt similar norms. Youth \nwho have family members and close friends who smoke have a stronger p redilecti on \nto regular smoking. The role of socio -economic and demographic factors in smoking \ninitiation/experimentation is well documented. These factors include low socio -\neconomic status, smoking among family and friends, low self-esteem , poor academic \nperformances and behavioural problems  143, Level II-1; 144, Level II -2. \n \nComplex approaches show promise, with some persistence of abstinence (30 days \npoint prevalence abstinence or continuous abstinence at six months), especially those \nincorporating ele ments sensitive to stage of change and using motivational \nenhancement and CBT. Given the episodic nature of adolescent smoking, more data \nis needed on sustained quitting. There were few trials with evidence about \npharmacological interventions (nicotine rep lacement and bupropion), and none \ndemonstrated effectiveness for adolescent smokers. There is not yet sufficient \nevidence to recommend widespread implementation of any one model. There \ncontinues to be a need for well -designed adequately powered randomized controlled \ntrials of interventions for this population of smokers."

Nonetheless, u sing age as a predictor for tailoring \nsmoking cessation drugs might  potentially lead to a more individualized prescription \nof smoking cessation therapy.  For example, a study has shown that b eing over 60 \nyears of age was significantly associated with increased cessation success  among \nthose who used NRT alone, while t he effectiveness of varenicline and bupropion were \nnot significantly diff erent according to age groups.  \n \nCounselling interventions, physician advice, buddy support program mes, age -tailored \nself-help materials, telephone counselling, and the nicotine patch all have been shown \nto be effective in treating tobacco use in adults 50 and older20, Level I. Elderly smokers  \nwith co -morbidities  and psychological distress are more likely to try to stop smoking147, \nLevel II -2, while older adults with low psychological distress and fewer health concerns \nare less likely to quit. This second group may need different sorts of motivational and \neducational strategies to support smoking cessation148, Level II -2."

Note that the health risks of weight gain are small when compared to the risks \nof continued smoking  \nii. Recommend physical activities and a balanced, healthy diet to control weight  \niii. Recommend that patients should concentrate primarily on smoking cessation, \nnot weight control, until ex -smokers are confident that they will not return to \nsmokin g. \n \nA majority of smokers gain weight after they quit smoking. Smoking cessation is \nassociated with a mean increase of 4 -5 kg in body weight after 12 months of \nabstinence, and most weight gain occurs within three months of quitting149, Level I. It has \nbeen reported that about 10% of quitters gain up  to 15 kilograms150, Level I. However, \nweight gain that follows smoking cessation  is a negligible health threat compared with \nthe risks of continued smoking151, Level I.   \n \nWeight gain that follows smoking cessation is a negligible health threat compared with \nthe risks of  contin ue smoking . Post-cessation we ight gain appears to be caused both \nby increased intake and by metabolic adjustments.  The involvement of metabolic \nmechanisms suggests  that even if smokers do not increase their caloric intake upon \nquitting, they will, on average , gain some weight152, Level II -1; 153, Level II -2; 154, Level II -1. \n \nSome smoking cessation pharmacological treatments may also have limited  weight \ngain. Bupropion, fluoxetine,  NRT and varenicline all limit weight gain during treatment \nhowever, the effects on weight gain reduction were smaller after the t reatment had \nstopped and there was insufficient evidence to be sure that these effe cts persisted in \nthe long -term155, Level I ; 156; Level I."

A non -nicotine aid to smoking \ncessation originally developed and marketed as an antidepressant. It is chem ically \nunrelated to tricyclics, tetracyclics , selective serotonin re-uptake inhibi tors, or other \nknown antidepres sant medications. Its mechanism of action is presumed to be  \nmediated through its capacity to block the re -uptake of dopamine and norepinephrine \ncentrally.  \n \nClinician . A professional directly providing health care services.  \n \nExtra -treatment social support component . Interventions or elements of an \nintervention wher ein patients are provided with tools or assistance in obtaining social \nsupport outside of treatment. This category is distinct from intra -treatment social \nsupport, in which social support is delivered directly by treatment staff.  \n \nFirst -line pharmacotherap y for tobacco dependence . First -line \npharmacotherapies have been found to be safe and effective for tobacco dependence \ntreatment and have been approved by the FDA for this use. First -line medications \nhave established  empirical record of efficacy, and should be considered first as part \nof tobacco dependence treatment except in cases of contraindications.  \n \nIntensive Clinical Intervention .  Refers to interventions that involve  extended \ncontact between cli nicians and pati ents. It was coded based on the length of contact \nbetween clinicians and patients (greater than 10 minutes). If that information was \nunavailable, it was coded based on the content of the contact between clinicians and \npatients.  \n \nIntra -treatment social supp ort. Refers to an intervention component that is intended \nto provide encouragement, a sense of concern, and interested empathic listening as \npart of the treatment.  \n \nLow-intensity counselling . Low -intensity counselling refers to interventions that \ninvolve c ontact between clinicians and patients and that last between 3 and 10 \nminutes. If the information on length of contact was unavailable, it was coded based \non the description of conten t of the clinical intervention.  \n \nBrief Clinical Intervention . Brief clini cal intervention  refers to interventions that \ninvolve very brief contact between clinicians and patients. It was coded based on the \nlength of contact between clinicians and patients (3 minutes or less). If that information \nwas unavailable, it was coded bas ed on the content of the clinical intervention ."

        "text": "54 Motivation . A type of intervention designed to bolster patients‚Äô resolve to quit through \nmanipulations such as setting a quit date, use of a contract with a sp ecified quit date, \nreinforcing correspondence  (letters mailed from  clinical/study staff congratulating the \npatient on his or her decision to quit or on early success), providing information about \nthe heal th risks of smoking, and so on.  \n \nNicotine replacement therapy (NRT) . Refers to a medication containing nicotine that \nis intended to promote smoking cessation. There are a few nicotine replacement \ntherapy delivery systems currently approved for use in Malaysia. These include \nnicotine che wing gum, nicotine inhaler and nicotine patch, nicotine nasal  spray . \n \nPerson -to-person intervention . In-person, or face -to-face, contact between a \nclinician and a patient(s) for the purpose of tobacco use intervention or assessment.  \n \nPractical counselling  (problem solving/skills training). Refers to a tobacco use \ntreatment in which tobacco users are trained to identify and cope with events or \nproblems that  increase the likelihood of their tobacco use. For example, quitters might \nbe trained to anticipate stressful events and to use coping skills such as distraction o r \ndeep breathing to cope with an urge to smoke. Related and similar interventions are \ncoping skill training, relapse prevention, and stress management.  \n \nPrimary care clinician . A clinician (e.g., in medicine, nursing, psychology, \npharmacology, dentistry/or al health, physical, occupational, and respiratory therapy) \nwho provides basic health care services for problems other than tobacco use per se. \nPrimary care providers are encouraged to identify tobacco users and to intervene, \nregardless of whether tobacco use is the patient‚Äôs presenting problem.  \n \nProactive telephone counselling . Treatment initiated by a clinician who telephones \nand counsels the patient over the telephone.  \n \nPsychosocial interventions . Refers to intervention strategies that are designed to \nincrease tobacco abstinence rates due to psychological or social support \nmechanisms. These interventions  comprise such treatment strategies as counselling, \nself-help,  and behavioural treatment like rapid smoking and contingency contracting.  \n \nQuit date . The d ate of a given cessation attempt during which a patient tries to abstain \ntotally from tobacco use. Also,  refers to a motivational intervention, whereby a patient \ncommi ts to quit tobacco use on a spe cified day.  \n \nRandomised controlled trial . For the purposes of this guideline, a study in which \nsubjects are assigned to conditions on the basis of chance, and where at least one of \nthe conditions is a control or comparison condition."

As smoking induces \nCYP1A2, smoking cessation may result in an increase of \nplasma levels of CYP1A2 substrates.  \nSmoking cessation, with or without pharmacotherapy, has \nbeen associated with the exac erbation of underlying \npsychiatric illness (e.g.  depression). Care should be taken \nwith patients with a history of psychiatric illness and patients \nshould be advised accordingly.  \nThere is no clinical experience with varenicline in patients \nwith epilepsy.  \nAt the end of treatment, discontinuation of varenicline was \nassociated with an increase in irritability, urge to smoke, \ndepression, and/or insomnia in up to 3% of patients. The \nprescriber should inform the patient accordingly and discuss \nor consider the ne ed for  dose tapering.  \nDepressed mood may be a symptom of nicotine withdrawal. \nDepression, rarely including suicidal ideation and suicide \nattempt, has been reported in patients undergoing a smoking \ncessation attempt.
