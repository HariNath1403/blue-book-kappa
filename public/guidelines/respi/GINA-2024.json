        "text": "8 Preface \nAsthma is a serious global health problem affecting all age groups. Its prevalence is increasing in many countries, \nespecially among children. Although some countries have seen a decline in hospitalizations and deaths from asthma, asthma still imposes an unacceptable burden on healthcare systems, and on society through loss of productivity in the \nworkplace and, especially for pediatric asthma, disruption to the family.  \nIn 2023 the Global Initiative for Asthma celebrate d 30 years of working to improve the lives of people with asthma by \ntranslating medical evidence into better asthma care worldwide. Established in 1993 by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the World Health Organization, GINA works with healthcare professionals, researchers, patients and public health officials around the world to reduce asthma prevalence, morbidity and mortality. The Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention (‘GINA Strategy Report’) was first published in 1995,  and has been updated \nannually since 2002 by the GINA Science Committee. It contains guidance for primary care practitioners, specialists and allied health professionals, based on the latest high- quality evidence available. More resources and supporting \nmaterial are provided online at www.ginasthma.org.  \nGINA supports global efforts to achieve environmental sustainability in health care, while ensuring that our guidance reflects an optimal balance between clinical and environmental priorities, with a particular focus on patient safety. \nGINA also supports efforts to ensure global availability of, and access to, effective quality -assured medications, to \nreduce the burden of asthma mortality and morbidity. Since 2001, GINA has organized the annual World Asthma Day, \na focus for local and national activities to raise awareness of asthma and educate families and healthcare professionals about effective asthma care.  \nGINA is an independent organization funded solely through sale and licensing of its educational publications. Members \nof the GINA Board of Directors are drawn globally from leaders with an outstanding demonstrated commitment to \nasthma research, asthma clinical management, public health and patient advocacy. GINA Science Committee members are highly experienced asthma experts from around the world, who continually review and synthesize scientific evidence to provide guidance on asthma prevention, diagnosis and management. The GINA Dissemination Task Group is responsible for promoting GINA resources throughout the world. Members work with an international \nnetwork of patient representatives and leaders in asthma care (GINA Advocates), to implement asthma education \nprograms and support evidence- based care. GINA support staff comprise the Executive Director and Project Manager.  \nWe acknowledge the superlative work of all who have contributed to the success of the GINA program. In particular, we recognize the outstanding long- term dedication of founding Scientific Director Dr Suzanne Hurd and founding \nExecutive Director Dr Claude Lenfant in fostering GINA’s development until their retirement in 2015, and we were said \nto hear of Dr Lenfant’s passing last year . A tribute to Dr Lenfant is available on the GINA website \n(https://ginasthma.org/in- memorium-a- tribute- to-claude -lenfant -10-12-1928- to-06-26-2023/ ). W\ne acknowledge the \ninvaluable commitment and skills of our current Executive Director Rebecca Decker, and Program Director Kristi \nRurey . We continue to recognize the contribution of Prof J Mark FitzGerald to GINA for over 25 years until his passing \nin 2022. We also thank all members of the Science Committee, who receive no honoraria or reimbursement for their many hours of work in reviewing evidence and attending meetings, and the GINA Dissemination Working  Group and \nGINA Advocates.  \nWe hope you find this report to be a useful resource in the management of asthma and that it will help you work with \neac\nh of your patients to provide the best personalized care,  \nHelen K Reddel, MBBS PhD  \nChair, GINA Science Committee  \nArzu Yorgancıoğlu, MD  \nChair, GINA Board of Directors  \n  \nCOPYRIGHTED MATERIAL - DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE"

        "text": "14 Introduction  \nAsthma is a serious global health problem, affecting approximately 300 million people around the world, and causing \naround 1, 000 deaths per day . Most of these deaths occur in low - and middle- income countries, and most of them are \npreventable. Asthma interferes with people’s work, education and family life, especially when children have asthma. \nAsthma is becoming more prevalent in many economically developing countries , and the cost of a sthma treatment for \nhealthcare systems, communities and individuals  is increasing. \nThe Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) was established to increase awareness about asthma among healthcare \nproviders, public health authorities and communities, to improve management of asthma, and to help prevent asthma.  \nEvery year GINA publishes a strategy report, containing information and recommendations on asthma, based on the latest medical evidence. GINA’s aim is for these to be available and used throughout the world. GINA also promotes \ninternational collaboration on asthma research. GINA Committee members are listed on page 9. \nGoals of asthma management   \nThe population goal of asthma management is to prevent asthma deaths and minimize the burden of asthma on \nindividuals, families, communities , health systems  and the environment . \nFor individuals with asthma  of all ages , the goal of asthma management is to achieve the patient’s  best possible  \nlong-term outcomes : \n• Long- term asthma symptom control, which may include:  \n- Few/no asthma symptoms  \n- No sleep disturbance due to asthma  \n- Unimpaired physical activity  \n• Long- term asthma risk minimization, which may include:   \n- No exacerbations  \n- Improved or stable personal best lung function  \n- No requirement for maintenance OCS  \n- No medication side -effects . \nThe patient’s goals for their asthma may be different from these medical goals; and patients with few or no asthma \nsymptoms can still have severe or fatal exacerbations, including from external triggers such as viral infections, allergen exposure (if sensitized) or pollution.   \nChallenges in global asthma management  \nFor healthcare providers, the challenges of managing asthma differ between regions and health systems.  Despite \nlaudable efforts to improve asthma care over the past 30 years, and the availability of effective medications, many patients globally have not benefited from advances in asthma treatment and often lack even the rudiments of care. Many of the world’s population live in areas with inadequate medical facilities and meager financial resources. GINA recognizes that the recommendations found in this report must be adapted to fit local practices and the availability of \nhealthcare resources. To improve asthma care and patient outcomes, evidence- based recommendations must also be \ndisseminated and implemented nationally and locally, and integrated into health systems and clinical practice. \nImplementation requires an evidence- based strategy involving professional groups and stakeholders and considering \nlocal cultural and socioeconomic conditions. GINA is a partner organization in the Global Alliance against Chronic Respiratory Diseases (GARD). Through the work of GINA, and in cooperation with GARD and the International Union \nAgainst Tuberculosis and Lung Diseases (IUATLD), substantial progress toward better care for all patients with \nasthma should be achieved in the next decade.  \nAt the most fundamental level, patients in many areas do not have access to any inhaled corticosteroid- containing \nmedications, which are the cornerstone of care for asthma patients of all severity. More broadly, medications remain the major contributor to the overall costs of asthma management, so the access to and pricing of high- quality asthma \nmedications continues to be an issue of urgent need and a growing area of research interest.\n1-3 The safest and most \nCOPYRIGHTED MATERIAL - DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE"

        "text": "15 effective approach to asthma treatment in adolescents and adults, which also avoids the consequences of starting \ntreatment with short -acting beta 2 agonist ( SABA) alone, and requires only a single medication, depends on access to \nthe combination of inhaled corticosteroid and formoterol ( ICS–formoterol ) across all asthma severity levels.4,5 \nBudesonide- formoterol is included in the World Health Organization (WHO) essential medicines list, so the \nfundamental change to anti -inflammatory treatment that was first included in the 2019 GINA Strategy Report6 may \nprovide a feasible solution to reduce the risk of severe exacerbations in low - and middle- income countries.5 \nThe urgent need to ensure access to affordable, quality -assured inhaled asthma medications as part of universal \nhealth coverage must now be prioritized by all relevant stakeholders, particularly manufacturers of relevant inhalers. GINA is collaborating with IUATLD and other organizations to work towards a World Health Assembly Resolution to \nimprove equitable access to affordable care, including inhaled medicines, for children, adolescents and adults with \nasthma.\n3 \nThere is increasing concern globally about climate change, and its impact on the health and security of populations, particularly in low - and middle- income countries. The propellants in pressurized metered- dose inhalers contribute \nsignificantly to the carbon footprint of health care, particularly from use of SABAs . The GINA Track 1 approach not only \nprovides a large reduction in exacerbations, in risk of adverse effects of oral corticosteroids, and in urgent health  care \ncompared with SABA -only treatment, but  also, if implemented with a dry powder inhaler ( as in most of the clinical \ntrials ), it provides a very large reduction in carbon footprint.\n7 GINA fully supports initiatives to encourage use of \ndry-powder inhalers, where they are available and clinically appropriate, and to replace harmful propellants with \nlow-carbon alternatives. At the same time, it is essential to ensure continuity of supply of essential inhaled medicines \nto people in low -resource areas, to avoid exacerbating the existing serious global inequities in health care for asthma.8 \nMethodology  \nGINA SCIENCE COMMITTEE  \nThe GINA Science Committee was established in 2002 to review published research on asthma management and prevention, to evaluate the impact of this research on recommendations in GINA documents, and to provide yearly updates to these documents. The members are recognized leaders in asthma research and clinical practice, with the scientific expertise to contribute to the task of the Committee. They are invited to serve for a limited period and in a voluntary capacity. The Committee is broadly representative of adult and pediatric disciplines, and members are drawn \nfrom diverse geographic regions. The Science Committee normally meets in person three times yearly, in conjunction \nwith the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and European Respiratory Society (ERS) international conferences  and at a \nstand- alone meeting, to review asthma- related scientific literature. During COVID -19, meetings of the Science \nCommittee were held online each month, and online meetings have continued every 1– 2 months since then . \nStatements of interest for Committee members (p. 9) are found on the GINA website www.ginasthma.org . \nPROCESSES FOR UPDATES AND REVISIONS OF THE GINA STRATEGY REPORT  \nLiterature search  \nDetails are provided on the GINA website (www.ginasthma.org/about -us/methodology). In summary, two PubMed \nsearches are performed each year, each covering the previous 18 months, using filters established by the Science Committee. The search terms include asthma, all ages, only items with abstracts, clinical trial or meta- analysis or \nsystematic review, and human. The search is not limited to specific PICOT (Population, Intervention, Comparison, \nOutcomes, Time) questions. The ‘clinical trial’ publication type includes not only conventional randomized controlled \ntrials, but also pragmatic, real -life and observational studies. The search for systematic reviews includes, but is not \nlimited to, those conducted using GRADE methodology.\n9 An additional search is conducted for guidelines documents \npublished by other international organizations. The respiratory community is also invited to submit any other fully published peer -reviewed publications that they believe have been missed, providing that the full paper is submitted in \n(or translated into) English; however, because of the comprehensive process for literature review, such ad hoc submissions have rarely resulted in substantial changes to the report.  \nCOPYRIGHTED MATERIAL - DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE"

        "text": "16 Systematic reviews  \nUnique among evidence- based recommendations in asthma, and rare among clinical practice guidelines in most other \ntherapeutic areas, the GINA report is based on an ongoing twice- yearly cumulative update of the evidence base for its \nrecommendations. GINA does not normally carry out or commission its own GRADE -based reviews, because of the \ncurrent cost of such reviews, the large number of PICOT questions that would be necessary for a comprehensive \npractical report of this scope, and because it would limit the responsiveness of the GINA Strategy Report to emerging evidence and new developments in asthma management. However, the Science Committee reviews relevant published systematic reviews conducted with GRADE methodology as part of its normal process. GINA recommendations are constantly being reviewed and considered for update as new evidence (including GRADE -\nbased systematic reviews on specific topics) is identified and indicates the need.  \nWith recognition of allergen immunotherapy as an area of the GINA report that needed substantial updating, a GINA working group conducted a systematic review of articles on subcutaneous immunotherapy or sublingual \nimmunotherapy since publication of two recent systematic reviews.\n10,11 From  the period 01/01/2018 to 10/28/2023, the \nworking group  screened the titles and abstracts of 350 articles for quality and relevance, and undertook full -text review \nof 73 publications. On the basis of this systematic review, the section of the GINA report on allergen immunotherapy \n(p.104) has been extensively updated.  \nLiterature screening and review  \nEach article identified by the literature search, after removal of duplicates and those already reviewed, is pre- screened \nin Covidence for relevance and major quality issues by the Editorial Assistant and by at least two non- conflicted \nmembers of the Science Committee. Each publication selected from screening is reviewed for quality and relevance by at least two members of the Science Committee, neither of whom may be an author (or co- author) or declare a \nconflict of interest in relation to the publication. Articles that have been accepted for publication and are online in advance of print are eligible for full text review if the approved/corrected copy -edited proof is available. All members \nreceive a copy of all abstracts and full text publications, and non- conflicted members have the opportunity to provide \ncomments during the pre- meeting review period. Members evaluate the abstract and the full text publication, and \nanswer written questions in a review template about whether the scientific data impact on GINA recommendations, and if so, what specific changes should be made. In 2020, the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) checklist\n12 \nwas provided in the review template to assist in evaluation of systematic reviews. A list of all publications reviewed by the Committee is posted on the GINA website ( www.ginasthma.org ). \nDiscussion and decisions during Science Committee meetings  \nEach publication that is assessed by at least one reviewer to potentially impact on the GINA Strategy Report is discussed in a Science Committee meeting (virtual or face- to-face). This process comprises three parts, as follows:  \n1. Quality and relevance of original research and systematic review publications. First, the Committee considers the relevance of the publication to the GINA Strategy Report, the quality of the study, the reliability of the findings, and \nthe interpretation of the results, based on the responses from reviewers and discussion by members of the Committee. \nFor systematic reviews, GRADE assessments, if available, are considered. However, for any systematic review, GINA members also independently consider the clinical relevance of the question addressed by the review, and the scientific and clinical validity of the included populations and study design. For network meta- analyses, reviewers also consider  \nthe appropriateness of the comparisons (e.g. , whether differences in background exacerbation risk and ICS dose were \ntaken into account) and the generalizability of the findings. During this discussion, a member who is an author (or was involved in the study) may be requested to provide clarification or respond to questions about the study, but they may not otherwise take part in this discussion about the quality and relevance of the publication.  \n2. Decision about inclusion of the evidence. During this phase, the Committee decides whether the publication or its findings affect GINA recommendations or statements and should be included in the GINA Strategy Report. These \ndecisions to modify the report or its references are made by consensus by Committee members present and, again, \nany member with a conflict of interest is excluded from these decisions. If the chair is an author on a publication being reviewed, an alternative chair is appointed to lead the discussion in part 1 and the decision in part 2 for that publication.  \nCOPYRIGHTED MATERIAL - DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE"

        "text": "17 3. Discussion about related changes to the GINA Strategy Report. If the committee resolves to include the \npublication or its findings in the report, an author or conflicted member, if present, is permitted to take part in the subsequent discussions about and decisions on changes to the report, including the positioning of the study findings in the report and the way that they would be integrated with existing (or other new) components of the GINA \nmanagement strategy. These discussions may take place immediately, or over the course of the year as new evidence \nemerges or as other changes to the report are agreed and implemented. The approach to managing conflicts of interest, as described above, also applies to members of the GINA Board who , ex-officio , attend GINA Science \nCommittee meetings.  \nAs with all previous GINA Strategy Reports, levels of evidence are assigned to management recommendations where \nappropriate. Current criteria (Table A) are based on those originally developed by the National Heart Lung and Blood \nInstitute. From 2019, GINA has included in ‘Level A ’ strong observational evidence that provides a consistent pattern of \nfindings in the population for which the recommendation is made, and has also described the values and preferences that were considered in making major new recommendations. The table was updated in 2021 to avoid ambiguity about \nthe positioning of observational data and systematic reviews.  \nTable A. Description of levels of evidence used in this report  \nEvidence \nlevel  Sources  \nof evidence  Definition \nA Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), systematic reviews, observational \nevidence. Rich body of \ndata Evidence is from endpoints of well- designed RCTs, systematic \nreviews of relevant studies or observational studies that provide a consistent pattern of findings in the population for which the \nrecommendation is made. Category A requires substantial numbers of \nstudies involving substantial numbers of participants.  \nB Randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews. Limited body of data Evidence is from endpoints of intervention studies that include only a limited number of patients, post hoc or subgroup analysis of RCTs or systematic reviews of such RCTs. In general, Category B applies when few randomized trials exist, they are small in size, they were undertaken in a population that differs from the target population of \nthe recommendation, or the results are somewhat inconsistent.  \nC Nonrandomized trials or \nobservational studies  Evidence is from non- randomized trials or observational studies.  \nD Panel consensus \njudgment  \n This category is used only in cases where the provision of some guidance was deemed valuable but the clinical literature addressing the subject was insufficient to justify placement in one of the other categories. The Panel Consensus is based on clinical experience or knowledge that does not meet the above listed criteria.  \nNew therapies and indications  \nThe GINA Strategy Report is a global strategy document. Since regulatory approvals differ from country to country, and manufacturers do not necessarily make regulatory submissions in all countries, some GINA recommendations are likely to be off -label in some countries. This is a particular issue for pediatrics, where across different diseases, many \ntreatment recommendations for preschool children and for children aged 6– 11 years are off -label.  \nFor new therapies , GINA’s aim is to provide clinicians with evidence- based guidance about new therapies and their \npositioning in the overall asthma treatment strategy as soon as possible; otherwise, the gap between regulatory approval and the periodic update of many national guidelines is filled only by advertising or educational material produced by the manufacturer or distributor. For new therapies for which the GINA Science Committee considers there is sufficient good- quality evidence for safety and efficacy or effectiveness in relevant asthma populations, \nrecommendations may be held until after approval for asthma by at least one major regulatory agency (e.g. , European \nMedicines Agency or US Food and Drug Administration), since regulators often receive substantially more safety \nCOPYRIGHTED MATERIAL - DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE"

However, \ndecisions by GINA to make or not make a recommendation about any therapy, or about its use in any specific \npopulation, are based on the best available peer -reviewed evidence and not on labeling directives from regulators.  \nFor existing therapies with evidence for new regimens or in different populations , the Science Committee may, \nwhere relevant, make recommendations that are not necessarily covered by regulatory indications in any country at the time, provided the Committee is satisfied with the available evidence around safety and efficacy/effectiveness. Since the GINA Strategy Report is a global strategy, the report does not refer to recommendations as being ‘off-label ’. \nHowever, readers are advised that, when assessing and treating patients, they should use their own professional judgment and should also consider  local and national guidelines and eligibility criteria, as well as locally licensed drug \ndoses.  \nExternal review  \nPrior to publication each year, the GINA Strategy Report undergoes extensive external review by patient advocates and by asthma care experts from primary and specialist care in multiple countries. There is also continuous external review throughout the year in the form of feedback from end- users and stakeholders through the contact form on the \nGINA website.  \nLiterature reviewed for GINA 2024 update  \nThe GINA Strategy Report has been updated in 2024 following the routine twice- yearly review of the literature by the \nGINA Science Committee.

        "text": "19 WHAT’S NEW IN  GINA 2024? \nThe GINA Strategy Report has been updated in 2024 following the routine twice- yearly cumulative review of the \nliterature by the GINA Scientific Committee, and extensive discussion about issues relevant to clinical practice and \nresearch. A copy showing tracked changes from the GINA 202 3 report is archived on the GINA website.  \nKEY CHANGES  \n• Diagnosis of asthma: The diagnostic flowchart for clinical practice (Box 1- 1, p.25) has been revised, recognizing \nthat, globally, a large proportion of health professionals do not have access (or timely access) to spirometry in their clinical practice. Although peak expiratory flow (PEF) is less reliable than spirometry, it is better than relying on \nsymptoms alone. The flowchart allows for selection of different initial lung function tests, depending on local \nresources. The criteria for identifying variable expiratory airflow limitation (Box 1- 2, p.26) have also been clarified, \nand more details provided about bronchodilator withholding.  \nGINA again reviewed, but has not adopted , the recommendation by the American Thoracic Society and European \nRespiratory Society Technical Standards Committee to change the criterion for bronchodilator responsiveness from \nan increase from baseline of ≥12% and 200 mL to an increase from baseline of >10% predicted. The Technical \nStandards Committee based this recommendation on data for survival , and had explicitly  avoided making any \nrecommendation about the use of this criterion for diagnostic decisions in clinical practice. This topic will be \nconsidered by GINA again when data from additional populations, and for other asthma outcomes, have been \npublished, to inform the implications of the proposed new criterion for diagnosis of asthma in clinical practice (p. 29). \n• Cough variant asthma: more information has been added (p. 24 and p. 32) about this clinical phenotype of asthma, \nwhich is common in some countries. Cough variant asthma may be difficult to distinguish from other causes of \nchronic cough in clinical practice, as spirometry may be normal and variable airflow limitation may be identified  only \nfrom bronchial provocation testing. Some patients may later also develop wheezing and bronchodilator \nresponsiveness. The treatment of cough variant asthma is the same as for asthma in general; the cough may return \nif inhaled corticosteroids ( ICSs) are stopped.  \n• Assessment of asthma control: We clarify that assessment of symptom control should not be limited to the most \nrecent 4 weeks, but that there are no validated tools for assessing symptom control over longer periods than this, and that recall -error for symptoms is common. GINA continues to emphasize that assessing symptom control is not \nenough – the patient’s risk factors for exacerbations (including history of exacerbations), for accelerated decline in \nlung function and for medication adverse effects must also be assessed (Box 2- 2, p.37). While ICS markedly reduce \nasthma exacerbations and, in patients not taking ICS, serious exacerbations are associated with greater decline in \nlung function, there is no clear evidence that use of ICS per se prevents long- term development of persistent airflow \nlimitation (p. 42). \n• GINA goal of asthma treatment (Box 3 -2, p.50): The goal of asthma treatment  is to achieve the best possible long-\nterm asthma outcomes for the individual patient, including both long- term symptom control and long- term \nminimization of risk of exacerbations, lung function decline and medication adverse effects (including long- term \nadverse effects of OCS). It is also important to elicit the patient/caregiver’s goals for asthma treatment, as these may differ from medical goals.  \n• Remission of asthma (p. 50): There has been extensive recent discussion in the clinical and research community \nabout asthma remission on treatment, in the context of biologic therapy for severe asthma. Several proposed definitions and criteria for their operationalization have been published. A new section of the GINA 2024 report outlines a framework for clinical practice and research about clinical and complete (pathophysiological) remission in \nchildren and in adults, both off -treatment and on- treatment. These perspectives  should also be considered for \ndiscussions with patients and parents/caregivers. The concept of asthma remission on treatment is consistent with \nthe GINA long- term goal of asthma treatment (Box 3- 2, p.50), but individual patient goals should be achievable. \n• Initial asthma treatment in adults and adolescents (Tracks 1 and 2):  Key changes have been made to the \nrecommendations about the choice of initial treatment step for adults and adolescents in both Tracks 1 and 2, with updating of Boxes 4- 4 (p.75) and 4- 5 (p.76) about choice of initial treatment step. The suggested criteria at each \nstep for initial treatment are based on evidence (where available) and on consensus, so the thresholds are not \nCOPYRIGHTED MATERIAL - DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE"

        "text": "20 precise. The new flowchart for initial asthma treatment (Box 4- 5, p.76) includes the GINA cycle of asthma \nmanagement as a reminder that asthma treatment is not just about medications.  \n• For Track 1 , as-needed- only low -dose ICS -formoterol has been the preferred treatment option for both Step 1 and \nStep 2 since 2021, so together they are called ‘ Steps 1 –2’. Accordingly, the descriptions of evidence and other \nconsiderations are now also presented for Steps 1 –2 together. A common question is which patients should instead \nstart treatment at Step 3, i.e. , with low -dose ICS -formoterol being taken as maintenance- and-reliever therapy \n(MART) rather than as -needed- only. There is no specific evidence to guide this choice, but clinical factors that are \nsuggested for consideration of starting with MART (if permitted by local regulators) include symptoms every day, \ncurrent smoking, low lung function, a recent severe exacerbation or a history of life- threatening exacerbation, \nimpaired perception of bronchoconstriction (e.g. low initial lung function but few symptoms ), severe airway \nhyperresponsiveness, or current exposure to a seasonal allergic trigger (p. 78). \n• For Track 2 , the previous description of patients suitable for Step 1 treatment (having asthma symptoms less than \ntwice a month and no risk factors for exacerbations) was introduced in GINA 2014 to limit the use of short -acting \nbeta 2 agonist ( SABA)- only treatment, as its risks in asthma were already well  known.13 This criterion for Step 1 \ntreatment has now been replaced, since GINA has recommended against SABA -only treatment since 2019. Another  \nconsideration for choosing between Step 1 and Step 2 treatment is that, although maintenance ICS almost halved the risk of serious exacerbations in patients with symptoms ≤2 days/week in a clinical trial, such patients would be very unlikely to take daily ICS if it was prescribed in clinical practice. Therefore, for patients  with such infrequent \nsymptoms , taking ICS whenever SABA is taken (Track 2, Step 1) is preferred over daily ICS plus as -needed SABA \n(Track 2, Step 2) to ensure that patients receive at least some ICS, rather than taking SABA alone.  \n• G\nINA 2024 treatment figure for adults and adolescents , Box 4- 6, p.77. There are no major changes from 2023 in \nthe main treatment figure. In the arrowed circle (also Box 3- 3, p.53), ‘asthma medications ’ has been changed to \n‘asthma medications including ICS’ as a reminder that all patients with asthma should receive ICS -containing \ntherapy . New short versions of the main treatment figure are shown at the start of the sections of text about Steps \n1–4 for Track 1 (Box 4- 7, p.78) and Track 2 (Box 4- 9, p.86) respectively.  \n• Medications and doses for Track 1 anti -inflammatory reliever (AIR) therapy : Following requests from clinicians, \nBox 4 -8, p.84 has been expanded to show all the relevant ICS -formoterol devices ( dry-powder inhalers [ DPIs ] and \npressurized metered- dose inhalers [ pMDIs ]) and doses for AIR therapy by age- group and treatment step, with the \ncorresponding dosing regimens and maximum number of inhalations in a single day. More  devices and doses may \nbecome available in the future.  \n• Beclometasone- formoterol for MART (Box 4 -7, p.78). There is evidence from randomized controlled trials and \nmeta- analyses in approximately 40,000 patients for the long- term safety and efficacy of as -needed budesonide-\nformoterol up to a maximum total of 72 mcg formoterol (54 mcg delivered dose) in a single day (total of as -needed \nand maintenance doses, if used) for adults and adolescents, together with data from earlier randomized controlled \ntrials with as -needed formoterol. Based on this extensive evidence, GINA suggests that the same maximum total \ndose of formoterol (with ICS) in a single day (72 mcg metered dose) should also apply for adults and adolescents \nprescribed MART with beclometasone- formoterol 100/6 mcg, i.e. a maximum total of 12 inhalations in a single day . \nFor children 6–11 years prescribed MART with budesonide- formoterol, the maximum recommended total dose of \nformoterol (with ICS) in a single day is 48 mcg metered dose (36 mcg delivered dose). Most patients need far fewer \ndoses in any day than the maximum doses recommended.  \n• ICS-formoterol as reliever with other ICS -LABAs : GINA previously recommended against use of ICS -formoterol \nas the reliever for patients using maintenance treatment with a combination of ICS  and long- acting beta 2 agonist \n(LABA) with a non- formoterol LABA, because of lack of evidence for safety or efficacy with this approach (p.69). \nThis recommendation is now supported by an analysis suggesting that taking two different LABAs in this way may \nbe associated with increased adverse events (p. 82).14 \n• Leukotriene receptor antagonists : Wherever montelukast is mentioned throughout the report, there is a reminder \nto advise patients/parents/caregivers about the potential risk of neuropsychiatric adverse events associated with this medication. These include new -onset nightmares and behavioral problems and, in some cases, suicidal \nideation.  \nCOPYRIGHTED MATERIAL - DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE"

However, t he findings suggest that in patients with severe \nasthma, maintenance doses of ICS- formoterol should not be stopped15 (p.156). This study also provides support for \nuse of MART in patients taking Step 5 treatment.  Additional  advice about stepping down treatment once asthma is \nwell controlled is in Box 4- 13 (p. 102).  \n• I\nnitial asthma treatment in children 6 –11 years: Boxes 4 -10 (p. 94) and 4- 11 (p.95) about initial asthma treatment \nin children 6 –11 years have been updated. These recommendations are based on evidence (where available) and \non consensus. The flowchart includes the GINA cycle of asthma management, as a reminder that asthma treatment \nis not just about medications. Symptom levels and lung function prompting a particular starting treatment step are similar to those for adults and adolescents.  \nIn the text about treatment steps, additional details about studies, populations and outcomes in the 6 –11 years age \ngroup have been added, including the ICS doses used in the studies of taking ICS whenever SABA is taken (Step 1, p.97).  \n• Low, medium and high doses of inhaled corticosteroids . Box 4 -2 (p.71) lists low, medium and high doses of \nvarious ICS, alone or in combination with LABA. GINA has emphasized for many years that this table does not imply potency equivalence, but this  continues to be assumed . For clarity , an example has been added: if you switch a \npatient’s treatment from a ‘medium’ dose of one ICS to a ‘medium’ dose of another ICS, this may represent a decrease (or increase) in potency, so the patient’s asthma may become unstable (or they may be at increased risk \nof adverse effects). After any change of treatment  or inhaler device , patients should be monitored to ensure stability.  \n• Allergen immunotherapy . The section on allergen immunotherapy (p. 104) has been updated following  a \nsystematic review of publications about subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) and sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) \nfor asthma by a GINA Science Committee working group. Information is also included about the quality assurance, personnel, training, safety and administrative protocols that must be observed for preparation and safe delivery of SCIT. For patients with severe asthma, allergen immunotherapy  may be considered as an add- on treatment, but \nonly after asthma symptoms and exacerbations have been controlled.  \nOther updates in GINA 2024 \n• Mild asthma: Further advice has been provided on language about mild and severe asthma (p.43). The term ‘mild \nasthma’ is a retrospective label, so it cannot be used to decide which patients are suitable to receive Step 1 or Step 2 treatment . \n• Pulmonary rehabilitation for asthma : There is now evidence from a systematic review and meta- analysis  for the \nbenefit of structured outpatient pulmonary rehabilitation programs in improving functional exercise capacity and quality of life for patients with asthma (p.60). Pulmonary rehabilitation also continues to be recommended for \npatients with asthma who have dyspnea due to persistent airflow limitation (Section 7, p. 131).  \n• Role of FeNO : Further evidence has emerged of differences in inflammatory biomarkers, including fractional \nconcentration of exhaled nitric oxide ( FeNO ), in patients with obesity (p. 31 and p. 72). The largest study to date of \nFeNO -guided management of asthma, conducted in pregnant women, found no reduction in asthma exacerbations \nor perinatal outcomes compared with usual care (p. 103).\n16 The main role of FeNO in clinical practice continues to \nbe to help guide treatment decisions in patients with severe asthma (p. 143).  \nCOPYRIGHTED MATERIAL - DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE"

        "text": "23 1. Definition, description, and diagnosis of asthma in adults,\nadolescents and children 6–11 years\nKEY POINTS  \nWhat is asthma?  \nAsthma is a heterogeneous disease, usually characterized by chronic airway inflammation. It is defined by the history \nof respiratory symptoms, such as wheeze, shortness of breath, chest tightness and cough, that vary over time and in \nintensity, together with variable expiratory airflow limitation. One or more symptoms ( e.g., cough) may predominate. \nAirflow limitation may later become persistent.  \nAsthma is usually associated with airway hyperresponsiveness and airway inflammation, but these are not necessary \nor sufficient to make the diagnosis.  \nRecognizable clusters of demographic  and clinical characteristics are called ‘ clinical asthma phenotypes’ . In most \ninstances, these do not correlate strongly with specific pathological processes or treatment responses. However, \nbiomarkers reflecting pathophysiological processes are useful in the assessment of difficult -to-treat asthma and \ntreatment of severe asthma.  \nHow is asthma diagnosed? \nThe diagnosis of asthma is based on the history of characteristic symptom patterns and evidence of variable \nexpiratory airflow limitation. This should be documented from bronchodilator reversibility testing or other tests. More \nthan one test may be needed to confirm asthma or exclude alternative causes of respiratory symptoms.  \nMany health professionals do not have access to spirometry . If so, peak expiratory flow (PEF) should be used, rather \nthan relying on symptoms alone.  \nTest before treating, wherever possible, i.e. , document the evidence for the diagnosis of asthma before starting inhaled \ncorticosteroid ( ICS)-containing treatment, as it is often more difficult to confirm the diagnosis once asthma control has \nimproved.  \nAdditional or alternative strategies may be needed to confirm the diagnosis of asthma in particular populations, \nincluding patients already on ICS -containing treatment, the elderly, patients presenting with cough as the only \nsymptom (including cough variant asthma) , and patients in low -resource settings.  \nDEFINITION OF ASTHMA  \nAsthma is a heterogeneous disease, usually characterized by chronic airway inflammation. It is defined by the history \nof respiratory symptoms, such as wheeze, shortness of breath, chest tightness and cough, that vary over time and in \nintensity, together with variable expiratory airflow limitation.  \nThis definition was reached by consensus, based on consideration of the characteristics that are typical of asthma \nbefore ICS -containing treatment is commenced, and that distinguish it from other respiratory conditions. However, \nairflow limitation may become persistent later in the course of the disease.  \nDESCRIPTION OF ASTHMA  \nAsthma is a common, chronic respiratory disease affecting 1– 29% of the population in different countries.17,18 Asthma \nis characterized by variable symptoms of wheeze, shortness of breath, chest tightness and/or cough, and by variable \nexpiratory airflow limitation. Both symptoms and airflow limitation characteristically vary over time and in intensity. \nThese variations are often triggered by factors such as exercise, allergen or irritant exposure, change in weather, or \nviral respiratory infections.  \nCOPYRIGHTED MATERIAL - DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE"

        "text": "24 Symptoms and airflow limitation may resolve spontaneously or in response to medication, and may sometimes be \nabsent for weeks or months at a time. On the other hand, patients can experience episodic flare- ups (exacerbations) \nof asthma that may be life- threatening and carry a significant burden to patients and the community. The majority of \nasthma deaths occur in low - and middle- income countries.2 Asthma is usually associated with airway \nhyperresponsiveness to direct or indirect stimuli, and with chronic airway inflammation. These features usually persist, even when symptoms are absent or lung function is normal, but may normalize with treatment.  \nAsthma phenotypes  \nAsthma is a heterogeneous disease, with different underlying disease processes. Recognizable clusters of demographic, clinical and/or pathophysiological characteristics are often called ‘asthma phenotypes ’.\n19-22 In patients \nwith more severe asthma, some phenotype- guided treatments are available. However, except in patients with severe \nasthma, no strong relationship has been found between specific pathological features and particular clinical patterns or treatment responses. More research is needed to understand the clinical utility of phenotypic classification in asthma.  \nMany clinical phenotypes of asthma have been identified.\n19-21 Some of the most common are:  \n• Allergic asthma: this is the most easily recognized asthma phenotype, which often commences in childhood and is associated with a past and/or family history of allergic disease such as eczema, allergic rhinitis, or food or drug allergy. Examination of the induced sputum of these patients before treatment often reveals eosinophilic airway \ninflammation. Patients with this asthma phenotype usually respond well to ICS treatment.  \n• Non- allergic asthma : some patients have asthma that is not associated with allergy. The cellular profile of the \nsputum of these patients may be neutrophilic, eosinophilic or contain only a few inflammatory cells \n(paucigranulocytic). Patients with non- allergic asthma often demonstrate a lesser short -term response to ICS.  \n• Cough variant asthma and cough predominant asthma :\n23 in some children and adults, cough may be the only \nsymptom of asthma, and evidence of variable airflow limitation may be absent apart from during bronchial provocation testing. Some patients subsequently also develop wheezing and bronchodilator responsiveness. ICS-containing treatment is effective. For more details, see p. 32. \n• A\ndult-onset (late- onset) asthma: some adults, particularly women, present with asthma for the first time in adult \nlife. These patients tend to be non- allergic, and often require higher doses of ICS or are relatively refractory to \ncorticosteroid treatment. Occupational asthma (i.e. , asthma due to exposures at work) should be ruled out in \npatients presenting with adult -onset asthma.  \n• Asthma with persistent airflow limitation: some patients with long- standing asthma develop airflow limitation that is \npersistent or incompletely reversible (see p. 29). This is thought to be due to airway wall remodeling. See \nChapter  5 (p.108) for more details about patients with features of both asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary \ndisease ( COPD ). \n• Asthma with obesity : some obese patients with asthma have prominent respiratory symptoms and a different \npattern of airway inflammation, with little eosinophilic inflammation.24 \nThere is little evidence about the natural history of asthma after diagnosis, but one longitudinal study showed that \napproximately 16% of adults with recently diagnosed asthma may experience clinical remission (no symptoms or \nasthma medication for at least 1 year) within 5 years.25 See p. 50 f or more information about remission.  \nMAKING THE INITIAL DIAGNOSIS  \nMaking the diagnosis of asthma before treatment is started, as shown in Box 1- 1 (p.25) and Box 1- 2 (p.26) is based on \nidentifying both a characteristic pattern of respiratory symptoms such as wheezing, shortness of breath (dyspnea), chest tightness or cough, and variable expiratory airflow limitation.\n26 The pattern of symptoms is important, as \nrespiratory symptoms may be due to acute or chronic conditions other than asthma (see Box  1-3, p.27). If possible, \nt\nhe evidence supporting a diagnosis of asthma (Box 1 -2, p.26 ) should be documented when the patient first presents, \nas the features that are characteristic of asthma may improve spontaneously or with treatment. As a result, it is often more difficult to confirm a diagnosis of asthma once the patient has been started on ICS -containing treatment, \nbecause this reduces variability of both symptoms and lung function (see Box 1-4 , p.30). GINA recognizes that, \nglobally, many health professionals lack access (or ready access) to spirometry,\n27 so advice has also been provided \nfor using PEF in asthma diagnosis.   \nCOPYRIGHTED MATERIAL - DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE"

In \nadults with an asthma diagnosis in the last 5 years, one- third could not be confirmed as having asthma after repeated \ntesting over 12 months with staged withdrawal of ICS -containing treatment. The diagnosis of asthma was less likely to \nbe confirmed in patients who did not undergo lung function testing at the time of initial diagnosis. Some patients (2%) \nhad serious cardiorespiratory conditions that had been misdiagnosed as asthma.29 It is important to confirm the \ndiagnosis of asthma in people with suggestive respiratory symptoms; a study in Canada found that patients with undiagnosed asthma had worse health- related quality of life and more unscheduled healthcare visits  than those \nwithout asthma, and similar to those with diagnosed asthma.\n30 \nHistory and family history \nCommencement of respiratory symptoms in childhood, a history of allergic rhinitis or eczema, or a family history of asthma or allergy, increases the probability that the respiratory symptoms are due to asthma. However, these features are not specific for asthma and are not seen in all asthma phenotypes. Patients with allergic rhinitis or atopic dermatitis should be asked specifically about respiratory symptoms.  \nPhysical examination  \nPhysical examination in people with asthma is often normal. The most frequent abnormality is expiratory wheezing (rhonchi) on auscultation, but this may be absent or only heard on forced expiration. Wheezing may also be absent during severe asthma exacerbations, due to severely reduced airflow (so called ‘silent chest’), but at such times, other physical signs of respiratory failure are usually present. Wheezing may also be heard with inducible laryngeal \nobstruction, COPD, respiratory infections, tracheomalacia, or inhaled foreign body  (when wheezing may be unilateral) . \nCrackles (crepitations) and inspiratory wheezing are not features of asthma.

        "text": "29 Lung function testing to document variable expiratory airflow limitation \nAsthma is characterized by variable expiratory airflow limitation, i.e., expiratory lung function varies over time, and in \nmagnitude, to a greater extent than in healthy populations. In asthma, lung function may vary over time between completely normal and severely obstructed in the same patient. Poorly controlled asthma is associated with greater \nvariability in lung function than well- controlled asthma.\n28 \nLung function is most reliably assessed by spirometry testing, with assessment of forced expiratory volume in \n1 second (FEV 1) and the ratio of FEV 1 to forced vital capacity  (FEV 1/FVC ). Spirometry  testing should be carried out by \nwell-trained operators with well -maintained and regularly calibrated equipment,31 with an inline filter to protect against \ntransmission of infection.32 However, globally, many clinicians do not have ready (or any) access to spirometry. In this \ncontext assessment of PEF, although less reliable, is better than no objective measurement of lung function. If PEF is \nused, the best of 3 measurements should be used each time, and the same meter should be used for follow -up \ntesting, as measurements may differ from meter to meter by up to 20%.33 \nA reduced FEV 1 or PEF may be found with many other lung diseases , or poor technique with inadequate inhalation. \nThis may be due to lack of effort or to inducible laryngeal obstruction. Reduced FEV 1/FVC (compared with baseline or \ncompared with the lower limit of normal ) indicates expiratory airflow limitation. Many spirometers now include age-\nspecific predicted values  for lower limit of normal in their software .34 \nIn clinical practice, once an obstructive defect has been confirmed, variation in airflow limitation is generally assessed from variation in FEV\n1 or PEF. ‘Variability’ refers to improvement and/or deterioration in symptoms and lung function. \nExcessive variability may be identified over the course of one day (diurnal variability), from day to day, from visit to \nvisit, or seasonally, or from a responsiveness test.  \nResponsiveness (previously called ‘r eversibility’)31 generally refers to rapid improvements in FEV 1 (or PEF), measured \nwithin minutes after inhalation of a rapid- acting bronchodilator such as 200– 400 mcg salbutamol, or more sustained \nimprovement over days or weeks after the introduction of ICS treatment.35 \nIn a patient with typical or suggestive respiratory symptoms, obtaining evidence of excessive variability in expiratory lung function is an essential component of the diagnosis of asthma. Some specific examples are:  \n•An increase in lung function 10–15 minutes after administration of a bronchodilator, or after a trial of ICS -\ncontaining treatment ; lung function may improve gradually, so it should be assessed after at least 4 weeks\n•A decrease in lung function after exercise (spontaneous or standardized) or during a bronchial provocation test\n•Variation in lung function beyond the normal range when it is repeated over time, either on separate visits, or on\ntwice -daily home monitoring over at least 1– 2 weeks.\nSpecific criteria for demonstrating excessive variability in expiratory lung function are listed in Box 1- 2 (p.26). A \ndecrease in FEV\n1 or PEF  during a respiratory infection, while commonly seen in asthma, does not necessarily indicate \nthat a person has asthma, as it may also be seen in otherwise healthy individuals or people with COPD.   \nHow much variation in expiratory airflow is consistent with asthma? \nBronchodilator responsiveness : There is overlap in bronchodilator responsiveness and other measures of variation \nbetween health and disease.36 In a patient with respiratory symptoms, the greater the variations in their lung function, \nor the more times excess variation is seen, the more likely the diagnosis is to be asthma (Box 1- 2, p.26). Generally, in \nadul\nts with respiratory symptoms typical of asthma, an increase or decrease in FEV 1 of ≥12% and ≥200 mL from \nbaseline, or (if spirometry is not available) a change in PEF of at least 20%, is accepted as being consistent with \nasthma. A Technical Standards C ommittee recommended changing the criterion for a positive bronchodilator \nresponsiveness test from an increase from baseline in FEV 1 or FVC of ≥12% and >200 mL (as at present)  to an \nincrease from baseline of >10% of the patient’s predicted value.37 This recommendation was based on data for \nsurvival, and the Technical Standards C ommittee avoided making any recommendation about the use of this criterion \nfor diagnostic decisions in clinical practice. This topic will be considered again by GINA when more data are available, \nincluding comparison with other diagnostic tests for asthma.  \nCOPYRIGHTED MATERIAL - DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE"

Then the average of each day’s value is \ncalculated over 1– 2 weeks. The upper 95% confidence limit of diurnal variability (amplitude percent mean) from twice \ndaily readings is 9% in healthy adults,38 and 12.3% in healthy children39 so, in general, diurnal variability >10% for \nadults and >13% for children is regarded as excessive.  \nIf FEV 1 is within the predicted normal range when the patient is experiencing symptoms, this reduces the probability \nthat the symptoms are due to asthma. However, patients whose baseline FEV 1 is >80% predicted can have a clinically \nimportant increase in lung function with bronchodilator or ICS -containing treatment. Predicted normal ranges \n(especially for PEF) have limitations, so the patient’s own best reading (‘personal best’) is recommended as their \n‘normal’ value.  \nBox 1-4 . Steps for confirming the diagnosis of asthma in a patient already taking ICS -containing treatment \nCurrent status  Steps to confirm the diagnosis of asthma  \n Variable respiratory \nsymptoms and variable airflow limitation   Diagnosis of asthma is confirmed.  Assess the level of asthma control (Box  2-2A and \nBox 2-2B, p.37) and review ICS -containing treatment (Box 4-6 , p.77; Box 4-12, p.96.) \n Variable respiratory symptoms but no variable \nairflow limitation   Consider repeating spirometry  (or PEF*)  after withholding bronchodilator (4 hrs for \nSABA, 24 –48 hrs for long- acting bronchodilators  (see below)  or during symptoms. Check \nbetween- visit variability of FEV 1, and bronchodilator responsiveness. If still normal, \nconsider other diagnoses (Box 1-3 , p.27). \n If FEV 1 (or PEF*) is >70% predicted: consider stepping down ICS- containing treatment \n(see Box 1-5 , p.32) and reassess in 2– 4 weeks, then consider bronchial provocation test \nor repeating bronchodilator responsiveness  test. \n If FEV 1 (or PEF*) is <70% predicted: consider starting or stepping up maintenance ICS-\ncontaining treatment for 3 months (Box 4-6 , p.77), then reassess symptoms and lung \nfunction. If no response, resume previous ICS dose and refer patient for diagnosis and \ninvestigation.  \n Few respiratory \nsymptoms, normal lung function, and no variable airflow limitation   Consider repeating BD responsiveness test  again after withholding bronchodilator as \nabove or during symptoms. If normal, consider investigati on for alternative diagnoses \n(Box 1-3, p.27). \n Consider stepping down ICS -containing treatment (see Box 1-5 , p.32):  \n• If symptoms emerge and lung function falls : asthma is confirmed. Step up ICS-\ncontaining treatment to previous lowest effective dose.  \n• If no change in symptoms or lung function at lowest controller step : consider ceasing \nmaintenance ICS-containing treatment , or switching to as -needed- only ICS- formoterol, \nand monitor patient closely for at least 12 months (Box  4-13, p.102). \n Persistent shortness of \nbreath and persistent \nairflow limitation   Consider stepping up ICS -containing treatment for 3 months  (Box 4-6, p.77), then \nreassess symptoms and lung function. If no response, resume previous ICS dose  and \nrefer patient for further investigation  and management, or manage as for patients with \nfeatures of both asthma and COPD (Section 7, p. 131).  \nSee list of abbreviations (p. 11). ‘Variable airflow limitation’ refers to expiratory airflow. Withholding period for long- acting \nbronchodilators : 24 hours for formoterol, salmeterol; 36 hours for indacaterol, vilanterol ; 36-48 hours for tiotropium, umeclidinium, \naclidinium, glycopyrronium . *If spirometry is not possible, PEF may be used, but it is less reliable. Use the same PEF meter each \ntime, as PEF may vary by up to 20% between different meters. For each PEF measurement, use the highest of 3 readings.  \nWhen can variable expiratory airflow limitation be documented?  \nIf possible, evidence of variable expiratory airflow limitation should be documented before treatment is started. This is because variability usually decreases with ICS treatment as lung function improves. In addition, any increase in lung function after initiating ICS- containing treatment can help to confirm the diagnosis of asthma. Bronchodilator \nresponsiveness may not be present between symptoms, during viral infections or if the patient has used a beta\n2 \nCOPYRIGHTED MATERIAL - DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE"

Challenge agents include inhaled methacholine,40 histamine, exercise,41 \neucapnic voluntary hyperventilation or inhaled mannitol. These tests are moderately sensitive for a diagnosis of \nasthma but have limited specificity40,41. For example, airway hyperresponsiveness to inhaled methacholine has been \ndescribed in patients with allergic rhinitis,42 cystic fibrosis43, bronchopulmonary dysplasia44 and COPD.45 This means \nthat a negative test in a patient not taking ICS can help to exclude asthma, but a positive test does not always mean \nthat a patient has asthma – the pattern of symptoms (Box 1- 2, p.26)  and other clinical features (Box 1- 3, p.27) must \nalso be considered.  \nAllergy tests  \nThe presence of atopy increases the probability that a patient with respiratory symptoms has allergic asthma, but this \nis not specific for asthma nor is it present in all asthma phenotypes. Atopic status can be identified by skin prick testing \nor by measuring the level of specific immunoglobulin E (sIgE) in serum. Skin prick testing with common environmental \nallergens is simple and rapid to perform and, when performed by an experienced tester with standardized extracts, is inexpensive and has a high sensitivity. Measurement of sIgE is no more reliable than skin prick tests and is more \nexpensive, but may be preferred for uncooperative patients, those with widespread skin disease, or if the history suggests a risk of anaphylaxis.\n46 The presence of a positive skin test or positive sIgE, however, does not mean that \nthe allergen is causing symptoms – the relevance of allergen exposure and its relation to symptoms must be \nconfirmed by the patient’s history.  \nImaging  \nI\nmaging studies are not routinely used in the diagnosis of asthma, but may be useful to investigate the possibility of \ncomorbid conditions or alternative diagnoses in adults with difficult -to-treat asthma. Imaging may also be used to \nidentify congenital abnormalities in infants with asthma- like symptoms, and alternative diagnoses in children with \ndifficult -to-treat asthma. High- resolution computed tomography (CT) of the lungs can identify conditions such as \nbronchiectasis, emphysema, lung nodules, airway wall thickening and lung distension, and may assess airway \ndistensibility. The presence of radiographically detected emphysema is considered when differentiating asthma from COPD (Box 7- 4, p.137), but there is no accepted threshold, and these conditions can coexist. Moreover, air trapping \n(which may be present in asthma, and is also a feature of ageing) can be difficult to distinguish from emphysema. Chest imaging is not currently recommended to predict treatment outcomes or lung function decline, or to assess treatment response.  \nCT of the sinuses can identify changes suggestive of chronic rhinosinusitis with or without nasal polyps (p. 120), which \nin patients with severe asthma may help with choice of biologic therapy (see Box 8-4, p.144).  \nExhaled nitric oxide  \nThe fractional concentration of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) is modestly associated with levels of sputum and blood eosinophils ,\n47 but this association is lost in obesity.24,48 FeNO has not been established as useful for ruling in or ruling \nout a diagnosis of asthma (see Definition of asthma, p. 23) because, while FeNO is higher in asthma that is \nc\nharacterized by Type 2 airway inflammation with elevated interleukin (IL) -4 and IL- 13,49 it is also elevated in non-\nasthma conditions (e.g. , eosinophilic bronchitis, atopy, allergic rhinitis, eczema), and it is not  elevated in some asthma \nphenotypes (e.g. , neutrophilic asthma, asthma with obesity ).24 FeNO is also lower in smokers and during \nbronchoconstriction50 and the early phases of allergic response;51 it may be increased or decreased during viral \nrespiratory infections.50 For information on the role of FeNO in asthma treatment, see Section 4 (p. 72). \nCOPYRIGHTED MATERIAL - DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE"

In primary care, the presence of asthma cannot be confirmed in many patients (25– 35%) who have \npreviously received this diagnosis .29,52 -55 \nThe process for confirming the diagnosis in patients already on ICS -containing treatment depends on the patient’s \nsymptoms and lung function (Box 1-4 , p.30). In some patients, this may include a trial of either a lower or a higher \ndose of ICS -containing treatment. If the diagnosis of asthma cannot be confirmed, refer the patient for expert \ninvestigation and diagnosis. For some patients, it may be necessary to step down the ICS -containing treatment  to \nconfirm the diagnosis of asthma. The process is described in Box 1-5 ( p.32). \nBox 1-5 .

Some  patients with cough variant asthma may later develop wheeze \nand significant bronchodilator responsiveness on spirometry.60 Most patients with cough variant asthma have sputum \neosinophilia, and they may also have elevated FeNO.22 Cough- variant asthma must also be distinguished from \neosinophilic bronchitis in which patients have cough and sputum eosinophilia but normal spirometry and normal airway \nresponsiveness.61 Treatment of cough variant asthma follows usual recommendations for asthma.  \nOccupational asthma and work- exacerbated asthma  \nAsthma acquired in the workplace is frequently missed. Asthma may be induced or (more commonly) aggravated by \nexposure to allergens or other sensitizing agents at work, or sometimes from a single, massive exposure. Occupational rhinitis may precede asthma by up to a year and early diagnosis is essential, as persistent exposure is \nassociated with worse outcomes.\n62,63 \nAn estimated 5– 20% of new cases of adult -onset asthma can be attributed to occupational exposure.62 Adult -onset \nasthma requires a systematic inquiry about work history and exposures, including hobbies. Asking patients whether \ntheir symptoms improve when they are away from work (weekends or vacation) is an essential screening question.64 It \nis important to confirm the diagnosis of occupational asthma objectively as it may lead to the patient changing their \noccupation, which may have legal and socioeconomic implications. Specialist referral is usually necessary, and \nfrequent PEF monitoring at and away from work is often used to help confirm the diagnosis. There is more information \nabout occupational asthma in Section 6 (p.117) and in s pecific guidelines.62 \nAthletes  \nThe diagnosis of asthma in athletes should be confirmed by lung function tests, usually with bronchial provocation \ntesting.65 Conditions that may either mimic or be associated with asthma, such as rhinitis, laryngeal disorders \n(e.g.,  inducible laryngeal obstruction),58 dysfunctional breathing, cardiac conditions and over -training, must be \nexcluded.66 \nPregnant women  \nPregnant women and women planning a pregnancy should be asked whether they have asthma so that appropriate advice about asthma management and medications can be given (p. 126).\n67 If the clinical history is consistent with \nasthma, and other diagnoses appear unlikely (Box 1-3 , p.27) but the diagnosis of asthma is not confirmed on initial \nbr\nonchodilator responsiveness testing  (Box 1 -2, p.26), manage as asthma with ICS -containing treatment (p.126) and \npostpone other diagnostic investigations until after delivery. During pregnancy, bronchial provocation testing is \ncontraindicated, and it is not advisable to step down ICS -containing treatment .  \nThe elderly \nAsthma is frequently undiagnosed in the elderly,68 due to poor perception of airflow limitation; acceptance of dyspnea \nas being ‘normal’ in old age , lack of fitness , and reduced physical activity. The presence of multimorbidity also \ncomplicates the diagnosis. In a large population- based survey of asthma patients older than 65 years, factors \nassociated with a history of asthma hospitalization included co- diagnosis of COPD, coronary artery disease, \ndepression, diabetes mellitus, and difficulty accessing medications or clinical care because of cost.69 Symptoms of \nwheezing, breathlessness and cough that are worse on exercise or at night can also be caused by cardiovascular \ndisease or left ventricular failure, which are common in this age group. A careful history and physical examination, combined with an electrocardiogram and chest X -ray, will assist in the diagnosis.\n70 Measurement of plasma brain \nnatriuretic polypeptide and assessment of cardiac function with echocardiography may also be helpful.71 In older \npeople with a history of smoking or biomass fuel exposure, COPD and overlapping asthma and COPD (asthma–COPD overlap) should be considered (Section 7, p. 131). \nSmokers and ex- smokers  \nAsthma and COPD may be difficult to distinguish in clinical practice, particularly in older patients and smokers and ex -\nsmokers, and these conditions may overlap (asthma- COPD overlap). The Global Strategy for Diagnosis, Management \nand Prevention of COPD (GOLD) 202472 defines COPD on the basis of chronic respiratory symptoms, environmental \nexposures such as smoking or inhalation of toxic particles or gases, with confirmation by post -bronchodilator \nFEV 1/FVC <0.7.

Uncertainty in the diagnosis should prompt early referral for specialized investigation and treatment \nrecommendations, as patients with asthma- COPD overlap have worse outcomes than those with asthma or COPD \nalone (see Section 7, p. 131).74 \nObese patients  \nWhile asthma is more common in obese than non- obese people,75 respiratory symptoms associated with obesity can \nmimic asthma. In obese patients with dyspnea on exertion, it is important to confirm the diagnosis of asthma with objective measurement of variable expiratory airflow limitation. One study found that non- obese patients were just as \nlikely to be over -diagnosed with asthma as obese patients (around 30% in each group).\n52 Another study found both \nover- and under -diagnosis of asthma in obese patients.76 \nLow- and middle- income countries  \nDiagnosis of asthma in low -resource settings, including low - and middle- income countries  (LMICs) , presents \nsubstantial challenges  for clinical practice .27 Access to lung function testing, particularly spirometry,  is often very \nlimited . Even when available, lung function testing may be substantially underused (e.g. , unaffordable for the patient or \nhealth system,77 or too time -consuming in a busy clinic . A single lung function test  may not be sufficient to confirm the \ndiagnosis of asthma or indicate an alternative cause, so more than one visit by the patient (with resulting costs of time and travel) may be needed .\n27 The differential diagnosis of asthma in these countries may often include other endemic \nrespiratory diseases (e.g.,  tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS -associated lung diseases, and parasitic or fungal lung diseases) . \nAs a result of these issues, clinicians often use a syndromic approach to diagnosis and initial management, based on \nhi\nstory and clinical findings .78 Practical evidence- based resources have been developed and implemented in several \ncountries.79,80 This approach reduces  diagnostic precision but is based on the assumption (valid in most LMICs) that \nunder -diagnosis and under -treatment of asthma is more likely81 than the overdiagnosis and overtreatment often seen \nin high income countries.29,82 \nGINA does not recommend that diagnosis of asthma should be solely based on syndromic clinical patterns , and \nsuggests lung function testing with a PEF meter if spirometry is not available.27 The World Health Organization (WHO) \nPackage of essential noncommunicable (PEN) disease interventions for primary care83 lists the PEF meter as an \nessential tool in the management of chronic respiratory diseases.  \nWhen spirometry is not available, the presence of variable expiratory airflow limitation (including reversible obstruction) \nc\nan be confirmed by PEF, as outlined in Box 1 -2, p.26. For example, before starting long- term ICS -containing \ntreatment, the following investigations can help to confirm the diagnosis of asthma (or prompt investigation for \nalternative diagnoses)  \n• ≥20% improvement in PEF 15 minutes after giving 2 puffs of albuterol83  \n• Improvement in symptoms and PEF after a 4- week therapeutic trial with ICS -containing treatment.27 \nEither of these findings would increase the likelihood of a diagnosis of asthma versus other diagnoses.  \nA structured algorithmic approach to patients presenting with respiratory symptoms forms part of several strategies developed for improving respiratory disease management in LMICs.\n5 These strategies are of particular use in \ncountries where, owing to the high prevalence of tuberculosis, large numbers of patients with respiratory symptoms present for assessment at tuberculosis clinics.  \nThere is a pressing need for access to affordable diagnostic tools (peak flow meters and spirometry), and training in t\nheir use, to be substantially scaled up in LMICs.27 \n   \nCOPYRIGHTED MATERIAL - DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE"

Assessment of asthma in adults, adolescents and children 6– 11 \nyears \nKEY POINTS  \nAsthma control  \n• The level of asthma control is the extent to which the features of asthma can be observed in the patient, or \nhave been reduced or removed by treatment.  \n• Asthma control is assessed in two domains: symptom control  and risk  of adverse outcomes. Poor \nsymptom control is burdensome to patients and increases the risk of exacerbations, but patients with good \nsymptom control can still have severe exacerbations.  \nAsthma severity  \n• The current definition of asthma severity is based on retrospective assessment, after at least 2 –3 months of \nasthma treatment, from the intensity of treatment required to control symptoms and exacerbations.  \n• This definition is clinically useful for severe asthma, as it identifies patients whose asthma is relatively \nrefractory to high intensity treatment with high- dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and a long- acting beta 2 \nagonist (LABA) and who may benefit from additional treatment such as biologic therapy. It is important to \ndistinguish between severe asthma and asthma that is uncontrolled due to modifiable factors such as incorrect \ninhaler technique and/or poor adherence.  \n• However, the retrospective definition of mild asthma as ‘easy to treat’ is less useful, as patients with few \ninterval symptoms can have exacerbations triggered by external factors such as viral infections or allergen \nexposure, and the treatment that was historically regarded as the lowest intensity – short -acting beta 2 agonist \n(SABA) alone – actually increases  the risk of exacerbations.  \n• ‘Mild asthma’ is a retrospective label, so it cannot be used to decide which patients are suitable to receive Step \n1 or Step 2 treatment.  \n• In clinical practice and in the general community, the term ‘mild asthma’ is often used to mean infrequent or \nmild symptoms, and it is often assumed that these patients are not at risk and do not need ICS -containing \ntreatment.  \n• For these reasons, GINA suggests that the term ‘mild asthma’ should generally be avoided in clinical practice if \npossible or, if used, qualified with a reminder that patients with infrequent symptoms can still have severe or \nfatal exacerbations, and that this risk is substantially reduced with ICS -containing treatment.  \n• GINA is continuing to engage in stakeholder discussions about the definition of mild asthma, to obtain \nagreement about the implications for clinical practice and clinical research of the changes in knowledge about \nasthma pathophysiology and treatment since the current definition of asthma severity was published.  \nHow to assess a patient’s asthma  \n• Assess symptom control from the frequency of daytime and night -time asthma symptoms, night waking and \nactivity limitation and, for patients using SABA reliever, their frequency of SABA use. Other tools for assessing \nrecent symptom control include Asthma Control Test (ACT) and Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ). There \nare no validated tools for assessing symptom control over a longer period.  \n• Also, separately, assess the patient’s risk factors for exacerbations, even if their symptom control is good. Risk \nfactors for exacerbations that are independent of symptom control include not only a history of ≥1 exacerbation \nin the previous year, but also SABA -only treatment (without any ICS), over -use of SABA, socioeconomic \nproblems, poor adherence, incorrect inhaler technique, low forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1), \nexposures such as smoking, and blood eosinophilia. To date, there are no suitable composite tools for \nassessing exacerbation risk.  \n• Also assess risk factors for persistent airflow limitation and medication side- effects (including from oral \ncorticosteroids), treatment issues such as inhaler technique and adherence, and comorbidities, and ask the \nCOPYRIGHTED MATERIAL - DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE"

It should be recorded at diagnosis, 3– 6 months after starting treatment, and periodically thereafter.  \n• Investigate for impaired perception of bronchoconstriction if there are few symptoms but low lung function, and \ninvestigate for alternative diagnoses if there are frequent symptoms despite good lung function.  \nOVERVIEW \nThe long- term goal of asthma treatment is to achieve the best possible long- term outcomes for the patient (see \nBox 3-2, p.50 for more details about goals of treatment). For every patient, assessment of asthma should include the \nassessment of asthma control (both symptom control and future risk of adverse outcomes), treatment issues \n(particularly inhaler technique and adherence) , and any comorbidities that could contribute to symptom burden and \npoor quality of life (Box 2- 1, p.36). Lung function, particularly FEV 1 as a percentage of predicted value , is an important \npart of the assessment of future risk.  \nThe use of digital technology, telemedicine and telehealthcare in the monitoring of patients with asthma is rapidly \nincreasing, particularly during the COVID -19 pandemic. However, the types of interactions are diverse, and high-\nquality studies are needed to evaluate their utility and effectiveness.  \nBox 2- 1. Summary of assessment of asthma in adults, adolescents, and children 6 –11 years  \n1. Assess asthma control = symptom control AND future risk of adverse outcomes  \n• Assess symptom control over the last 4 weeks (Box 2- 2A, p.37) or longer . \n• Identify any other risk factors for exacerbations, persistent airflow limitation or side- effects (Box 2- 2B). \n• Measure lung function at diagnosis/start of treatment, 3– 6 months after starting ICS -containing \ntreatment, then periodically, e.g., at least once every 1 –2 years, but more often in at -risk patients and \nthose with severe asthma.  \n2. Assess treatment issues  \n• Document the patient’s current treatment step (Box 4-6 , p.77). \n• Watch inhaler technique (Box 5-2 , p.110), assess adherence (Box 5-3 , p.112) and side- effects.  \n• Check that the patient has a written asthma action plan.  \n• Ask about the patient’s attitudes and goals for their asthma and medications.  \n3. Assess multimorbidity   \n• Rhinitis, rhinosinusitis, gastroesophageal reflux, obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, depression and anxiety can contribute to symptoms and poor quality of life, and sometimes to poor asthma control (see Section 6, p. 117).  \nWhat is meant by ‘ asthma control ’? \nThe level of asthma control is the extent to which the manifestations of asthma can be observed in the patient, or have \nbeen reduced or removed by treatment.38,84 It is determined by the interaction between the patient’s genetic \nbackground, underlying disease processes, the treatment that they are taking, environment, and psychosocial \nfactors.84 \nAsthma control has two domains: symptom control and future risk of adverse outcomes (Box 2- 2, p.37). Both should \nalways be assessed. Lung function is an important part of the assessment of future risk; it should be measured at the start of treatment, after 3 –6 months of treatment (to identify the patient’s personal best), and periodically thereafter for \nongoing risk assessment.  \n  \nCOPYRIGHTED MATERIAL - DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE"

        "text": "38 How to describe a patient’s asthma control  \nAsthma control should be described in terms of both symptom control and future risk domains. For example:  \nMs X has good asthma symptom control, but she is at increased risk of future exacerbations because she has had a \nsevere exacerbation within the last year. Mr Y has poor asthma symptom control. He also has several additional risk \nfactors for future exacerbations including low lung function, current smoking, and poor medication adherence.  \nWhat does the term ‘asthma control ’ mean to patients?  \nMany studies describe discordance between the patient’s and health provider’s assessment of the patient’s level of \nasthma control. This does not necessarily mean that patients ‘over -estimate’ their level of control or ‘under -estimate’ its \nseverity, but that patients understand and use the word ‘control’ differently from health professionals, e.g. , based on \nhow quickly their symptoms resolve when they take reliever medication.84,121 If the term ‘ asthma control ’ is used with \npatients, the meaning should always be explained.  \nASSESSING ASTHMA SYMPTOM CONTROL  \nAsthma symptoms such as wheeze, chest tightness, shortness of breath and cough typically vary in frequency and intensity, and contribute to the burden of asthma for the patient. Poor symptom control is also strongly associated with an increased risk of asthma exacerbations.\n122-124  \nAsthma symptom control should be assessed at every opportunity, including during routine prescribing or dispensing. Directed questioning is important, as the frequency or severity of symptoms that patients regard as unacceptable or bothersome may vary from current recommendations about the goals of asthma treatment, and may differ from patient to patient. For example, despite having low lung function, a person with a sedentary lifestyle may not experience bothersome symptoms and so may appear to have good symptom control.  \nTo assess recent symptom control (Box 2- 2A, p.37) ask about the following in the past four weeks: frequency of \nasthma symptoms (days per week), any night waking due to asthma or limitation of activity and, for patients using a SABA reliever, frequency of its use for relief of symptoms. In general, do not include reliever taken before exercise, because some people take this routinely without knowing whether they need it.  \nFrequency of reliever use \nHistorically, frequency of SABA reliever use (<2 or ≥2 days/week) has been included in the composite assessment of symptom control. This distinction was arbitrary, based on the assumption that if SABA was used on >2 days in a week, the patient needed to start maintenance ICS -containing therapy or increase the dose. In addition, higher average use \nof SABA over a year is associated with a higher risk of severe exacerbations,\n86,87 and in the shorter term, increasing \nuse of as -needed SABA is associated with an increased likelihood of a severe exacerbation in subsequent days or \nweeks.125 \nHowever, for patients prescribed an anti -inflammatory reliever (AIR) such as as -needed low -dose ICS -formoterol \n(GINA Track 1, Box 4-6 , p.77 ), use of this reliever more than 2 days/week is already providing additional ICS therapy, \nso further dose escalation may not be needed. In addition, increasing use of as -needed ICS -formoterol is associated \nwith a significantly lower risk of severe exacerbation in subsequent days or weeks compared with if the reliever is \nSABA,126,127 or compared with if the patient is using SABA alone.128 \nFor these reasons, while the assessment of symptom control in Box 2- 2A (p.37) includes a criterion for SABA reliever \nuse on ≤2 versus >2 days/week, it does not include a similar criterion for an anti -inflammatory reliever such as \nas-needed ICS -formoterol. However, the patient’s average frequency of as -needed ICS -formoterol use over the past 4 \nweeks should be assessed, and considered when the patient’s maintenance ICS dose (or need for maintenance ICS -\nformoterol) is reviewed. This issue will be reviewed again when more data become available.  \nTools for assessing recent asthma symptom control in adults and adolescents  \nSimple screening tools : these can be used in primary care to quickly identify patients who need more detailed \nassessment. Examples include the consensus -based GINA symptom control tool (Part A, Box 2- 2A, p.37). This \nclassification correlates with assessments made using numerical asthma control scores.129,130 It can be used, together \nwith a risk assessment (Box 2- 2B), to guide treatment decisions (Box 4-6 , p.77).

The Asthma APGAR tool includes a patient -completed asthma control assessment covering 5 \ndomains: activity limitations, daytime and nighttime symptom frequency (based on US criteria for frequency of night \nwaking), triggers, adherence, and patient -perceived response to treatment. This assessment is linked to a care \nalgorithm for identifying problems and adjusting treatment up or down. A study in the US showed that introduction of the Asthma APGAR tools for patients aged 5– 45 years in primary care was associated with improved rates of asthma \ncontrol; reduced asthma- related urgent care, and hospital visits; and increased practices’ adherence to asthma \nmanagement guidelines.\n134 \nNumerical ‘asthma control ’ tools : these tools provide scores and cut points to distinguish different levels of \nsymptom control, validated against healthcare provider assessment. Many translations are available. These scores \nmay be useful for assessing patient progress; they are commonly used in clinical research, but may be subject to \ncopyright restrictions. Numerical asthma control tools are more sensitive to change in symptom control than \ncategorical tools.129 \nExamples of numerical asthma control tools for assessing recent symptom control are:  \n• Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ):135,136 Scores range from 0– 6 (higher is worse), with scores calculated as \nthe average from all questions. The authors stated that ACQ ≤0.75 indicated a high probability that asthma was well controlled; 0.75– 1.5 as a ‘grey zone’; and ≥1.5 a high probability that asthma was poorly controlled, based on \nconcepts of asthma control at the time; they later added that the crossover point between ‘well -controlled’ and ‘not \nwell-controlled’ asthma was close to 1.00.\n137 The 5- item ACQ (ACQ -5), comprises five symptom questions. Two \nadditional versions were published: ACQ -6 includes SABA frequency, and ACQ -7 also includes pre- bronchodilator \nFEV 1% predicted. The minimum clinically important difference for all three versions of ACQ is 0.5.137 GINA prefers \nACQ 5 over ACQ -6 or 7 because the reliever question assumes regular rather than as -needed use of SABA, there \nis no option between zero SABA use in a week and SABA use every day, and ACQ has not been validated with ICS -\nformoterol or ICS- SABA as the reliever. In addition, if ACQ -7 were to be used in adjustment of treatment, the \ninclusion of FEV 1 in the composite score could lead to repeated step- up in ICS dose for patients with persistent \nairflow limitation. For these reasons, data for ACQ -5, ACQ -6 and ACQ -7 cannot be combined for meta- analysis.  \n• A sthma Control Test (ACT):130,138,139 Scores range from 5 –25 (higher is better). Scores of 20– 25 are classified as \n‘well-controlled ’; 16– 19 as ‘not well -controlled’ ; and 5– 15 as very poorly controlled asthma. The ACT has four \nsymptom/ reliever questions plus patient self -assessed control. The minimum clinically important difference is 3 \npoints.139 It has not been validated with ICS- formoterol or ICS -SABA reliever.  \nPatients with good symptom control can still be at risk of future severe exacerbations or asthma- related death, and \nthere are many modifiable risk factors for exacerbations that are independent of symptom control (Box 2- 2B, p. 37), so  \nGINA does not recommend assessment tools that combine symptom control with exacerbation history.  \nWhen different tools are used for assessing asthma symptom control, the results correlate broadly with each other, but are not identical. Respiratory symptoms may be non- specific so, when assessing changes in symptom control, it is \nimportant to clarify that symptoms are due to asthma.  \nRecent symptom control can be assessed over the previous 1– 4 weeks using tools such as in GINA Box 2- 2A, or \nACQ -5 or ACT. There are no validated tools  for assessing asthma symptom control over a longer period ( e.g., \n12 months ); in clinical practice, the patient can be asked about previous months with a simple question, but there is \nlikely to be substantial recall error, particularly for mild symptoms.  \n  \nCOPYRIGHTED MATERIAL - DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE"

Specific questions for assessment of asthma in children 6 –11 years \nAsthma symptom control  \nDay symptoms  Ask: How often does the child have cough, wheeze, dyspnea or heavy breathing (number of \ntimes per week or day)? What triggers the symptoms? How are symptoms managed?  \nNight symptoms  Cough, awakenings, tiredness during the day? (If the only symptom is nocturnal cough, consider other diagnoses such as rhinitis or gastroesophageal reflux disease).  \nReliever use  How often is reliever medication used? (check date on inhaler or last prescription) Distinguish \nbetween pre- exercise use (sports) and use for relief of symptoms.  \nLevel of activity  What sports/hobbies/interests does the child have, at school and in their spare time? How does the child’s level of activity compare with their peers or siblings? How many days is the child absent from school? Try to get an accurate picture of the child’s day from the child \nwithout interruption from the parent/caregiver.  \nRisk factors for adverse outcomes  \nExacerbations  Ask: How do viral infections affect the child’s asthma? Do symptoms interfere with school or \nsports? How long do the symptoms last? How many episodes have occurred since their last \nmedical review? Any urgent doctor/emergency department visits? Is there a written action \nplan? Risk factors for exacerbations include a history of exacerbations, poor symptom control, \npoor adherence and poverty,113 and persistent bronchodilator reversibility even if the child has \nfew symptoms.107 \nLung function  Check spirogram curves and technique. Main focus is on FEV 1 and FEV 1/FVC ratio. Plot these \nvalues as percent predicted to see trends over time.  \nSide-effects  Check the child’s height at least yearly, as poorly controlled asthma can affect growth,140 and \ngrowth velocity may be lower in the first 1– 2 years of ICS treatment.141 Ask about frequency \nand dose of ICS and OCS.  \nTreatment factors  \nInhaler technique  Ask the child to show how they use their inhaler. Compare with a device- specific checklist.  \nAdherence  Is there any of the child’s prescribed maintenance medication (inhalers and/or tablets) in the \nhome at present? On how many days in a week does the child use it (e.g., 0, 2, 4, 7 days)?  \nIs it easier to remember to use it in the morning or evening? Where is the medication kept –  \nis it in plain view to reduce forgetting? Check date on inhaler.  \nGoals/concerns  Does the child or their parent or caregiver have any concerns about their asthma (e.g., fear of \nmedication, side -effects, interference with activity)? What are their goals for treatment?  \nComorbidities  \nAllergic rhinitis  Itching, sneezing, nasal obstruction? Can the child breathe through their nose? What \nmedications are being taken for nasal symptoms?  \nEczema  Sleep disturbance, topical corticosteroids?  \nFood allergy  Is the child allergic to any foods? (Confirmed food allergy is a risk factor for asthma- related \ndeath. )94 \nObesity  Check age- adjusted BMI. Ask about diet and physical activity.  \nOther investigations (if needed)  \n2-week diary  If no clear assessment can be made based on the above questions, ask the child or parent/caregiver to keep a daily diary of asthma symptoms, reliever use and peak expiratory flow (best of three) for 2 weeks.  \nFormal exercise challenge  Provides information about airway hyperresponsiveness and fitness (Box 1- 2, p.26).

        "text": "41 Tools for assessing recent asthma symptom control for children aged 6– 11 years  \nIn children, as in adults, assessment of asthma symptom control is based on symptoms, limitation of activities and use \nof rescue medication. Careful review of the impact of asthma on a child’s daily activities, including sports, play and social life, and on school absenteeism, is important. Many children with poorly controlled asthma avoid strenuous \nexercise so their asthma may appear to be well controlled. This may lead to poor fitness and a higher risk of obesity.  \nChildren vary considerably in the degree of airflow limitation observed before they complain of dyspnea or use their \nreliever therapy, and marked reduction in lung function is often seen before it is recognized by the parent or caregiver. They may report irritability, tiredness, and changes in mood in their child as the main problems when the child’s asthma is not controlled. Parents/caregivers have a longer recall period than children, who may recall only the last few \ndays; therefore, it is important to include information from both the parent/caregiver and the child when the level of \nsymptom control is being assessed.  \nSeveral numeric tools have been developed for assessing recent asthma symptom control for children. These include:  \n• Childhood Asthma Control Test (c -ACT)\n142 with separate sections for parent/caregiver and child to complete \n• Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ).143,144 \nSome asthma control scores for children include history of exacerbations with symptoms, but these may have the same limitations as described above for adults. They include the Test for Respiratory and Asthma Control in Kids (TRACK)\n145-147 and the Composite Asthma Severity Index (CASI).148 \nThe results of these various tests correlate, to some extent, with each other and with the GINA classification of \nsymptom control. Box 2- 3 (p.40) provides more details about assessing asthma control in children.  \nASSESSING FUTURE RISK OF EXACERBATIONS, LUNG FUNCTION DECLINE  AND  ADVERSE \nEFFECTS  \nThe second component of assessing asthma control (Box 2- 2B, p. 37) is to identify whether the patient is at risk of \nadverse asthma outcomes, particularly exacerbations, persistent airflow limitation, and side- effects of medications \n(Box 2-2B). Asthma symptoms, although an important outcome for patients, and themselves a strong predictor of \nfuture risk of exacerbations, are not sufficient on their own for assessing asthma for several reasons : \n• Asthma symptoms can be controlled by placebo or sham treatments149,150 or by inappropriate use of short -acting \nSABA or long-acting beta 2 agonist (LABA) alone,151 all of which leave airway inflammation untreated.  \n• Respiratory symptoms may be due to other conditions such as lack of fitness, or comorbidities such as inducible \nlaryngeal obstruction.58 \n• Anxiety or depression may contribute to higher symptom reporting.  \n• Some patients have impaired perception of bronchoconstriction, with few symptoms despite low lung function.152 \n• In patients with good symptom control, exacerbations can be triggered by environmental exposures such as viral \ninfections, allergen exposure and poor air quality.  \nAsthma symptom control and exacerbation risk should not be simply combined numerically, as poor control of symptoms and of exacerbations may have different causes and may need different treatment approaches.  \nRisk factors for exacerbations  \nPoor asthma symptom control itself substantially increases the risk of exacerbations.122-124 However, several additional \nindependent risk factors have been identified, i.e., factors that, when present, increase the patient’s risk of exacerbations even if symptoms are few. These risk factors (Box 2- 2B, p. 37)\n include a history of ≥1 exacerbation in \nthe previous year, poor adherence, incorrect inhaler technique, chronic sinusitis and smoking, all of which can be \nassessed in primary care.153 The risk of severe exacerbations and mortality increases incrementally with higher SABA \nuse, independent of treatment step.87 Prescribing of three or more 200- dose SABA inhalers in a year, corresponding to \nmore than daily use, is associated with an increased risk of severe exacerbations86,87 and, in one study, increased \nmortality.87 Risk factors and comorbidities that are modifiable (or potentially modifiable) are sometimes called ‘treatable \ntraits ’.154 \nCOPYRIGHTED MATERIAL - DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE"

        "text": "42 In children, the risk of exacerbations is greatly increased if there is a history of previous exacerbations; it is also \nincreased with poor symptom control, suboptimal drug regimen, comorbid allergic disease and poverty.113 \nRisk factors for development of persistent airflow limitation  \nThe average rate of decline in FEV 1 in non -smoking healthy adults is 15– 20 mL/year.155 People with asthma may have \nan accelerated decline in lung function and develop airflow limitation that is not fully reversible. This is often associated with more persistent dyspnea. Independent risk factors that have been identified for persistent airflow limitation include exposure to cigarette smoke or noxious agents, chronic mucus hypersecretion, and asthma exacerbations in patients not taking ICS\n117 (see Box 2- 2B, p. 37). Children with persistent asthma may have reduced growth in lung function, and \nsome are at risk of accelerated decline in lung function in early adult life.156 There is no clear evidence that treatment \nwith ICS prevents accelerated decline in post -bronchodilator lung function, i.e. , that it prevents development of \npersistent airflow limitation.  \nRisk factors for medication side -effects  \nChoices with any medication are based on the balance of benefit and risk. Most people using asthma medications do not experience any side- effects. The risk of side -effects increases with higher doses of medications, but these are \nneeded in few patients. Systemic side- effects that may be seen with long- term, high- dose ICS include easy bruising, \nan increase beyond the usual age- related risk of osteoporosis and fragility fractures, cataracts, glaucoma, and adrenal \nsuppression. Local side- effects of ICS include oral candidiasis ( thrush) and dysphonia. Patients are at greater risk of \nICS side -effects with higher doses or more potent formulations\n118,119 and, for local side- effects, with incorrect inhaler \ntechnique.120 A glossary of asthma medications has been added as an appendix at the end of this report (p. 212). \nDrug interactions with asthma medications: concomitant treatment with cytochrome P450 inhibitors such as ketoconazole, ritonavir, itraconazole, erythromycin and clarithromycin may increase the risk of ICS adverse effects such as adrenal suppression, and with short -term use, may increase the risk of cardiovascular adverse effects of the \nLABAs salmeterol and vilanterol (alone or in combination with ICS). Concomitant use of these medications is not recommended (see also p. 122).\n157 \nROLE OF LUNG FUNCTION IN ASSESSING ASTHMA CONTROL  \nDoes lung function relate to other asthma control measures?  \nLung function does not correlate strongly with asthma symptoms in adults158 or children.159 In some asthma control \ntools, lung function is numerically averaged or added with symptoms,135,160 but this is not recommended because if the \ntool includes several symptom items, these can outweigh clinically important differences in lung function.161 In addition, \nlow FEV 1 is a strong independent predictor of risk of exacerbations, even after adjustment for symptom frequency.  \nLung function should be assessed at diagnosis or start of treatment, after 3 –6 months of ICS -containing treatment to \nassess the patient’s personal best FEV 1, and periodically thereafter. For example, in most adult patients, lung function \nshould be recorded at least every 1– 2 years, but more frequently in higher risk patients including those with \nexacerbations and those at risk of decline in lung function (see Box 2- 2B, p. 37). Lung function should also be recorded \nmore frequently in children based on asthma severity and clinical course (Evidence D).  \nOnce the diagnosis of asthma has been confirmed, it is not generally necessary to ask patients to withhold their regular or as -needed medications before visits,\n38 but preferably the same conditions should apply at each visit.  \nHow to interpret lung function test results in asthma  \nA low FEV 1 percent predicted: \n• Identifies patients at risk of asthma exacerbations, independent of symptom levels, especially if FEV 1 is <60% \npredicted96,105,162 ,163 \n• Is a risk factor for lung function decline, independent of symptom levels116 \n• If symptoms are few, suggests limitation of lifestyle, or poor perception of airflow limitation,164 which may be due to \nuntreated airway inflammation.152 \nCOPYRIGHTED MATERIAL - DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE"

        "text": "43 Normal FEV 1: A ‘normal’ or near -normal FEV 1 in a patient with frequent respiratory symptoms (especially when \nsymptomatic)  prompts consideration of alternative causes for the symptoms ( e.g., cardiac disease, or cough due to \npost-nasal drip or gastroesophageal reflux disease; Box 1- 3, p.27). \nPersistent bronchodilator responsiveness : Finding significant bronchodilator responsiveness (increase in FEV 1 \n>12% and >200 mL from baseline)35 in a patient taking ICS -containing treatment, or who has taken a SABA within \n4 hours, or a LABA within 12 hours (or 24 hours for a once- daily LABA), suggests uncontrolled asthma, particularly \npoor adherence and/or incorrect technique. \nIn children, spirometry cannot be reliably obtained until age 5 years or more, and it is less useful than in adults. Many \nc\nhildren with uncontrolled asthma have normal lung function between flare- ups (exacerbations).  \nHow to interpret changes in lung function in clinical practice  \nWith regular ICS treatment, FEV 1 starts to improve within days, and reaches a plateau after around 2 months.165 The \npatient’s highest FEV 1 reading (personal best) should be documented, as this provides a more useful comparison for \nclinical practice than FEV 1 percent predicted. If predicted values are used in children, measure their height at each \nvisit. \nSome patients may have a faster than average decrease in lung function, and develop persistent (incompletely r\neversible) airflow limitation. While a short -term (e.g. , 3 months) trial of higher dose ICS or ICS -LABA may be \nappropriate to see if FEV 1 can be improved, high doses should not be continued longer than this if there is no \nresponse.  \nThe between- visit variability of FEV 1 (up to 12% week -to-week or 15% year -to-year in healthy individuals )35 limits its \nuse in adjusting asthma treatment or identifying accelerated decline in clinical practice. The minimal important difference for improvement and worsening in FEV\n1 based on patient perception of change has been reported to be \nabout 10%.166,167 \nThe role of short -term and long -term lung function monitoring  \nOnce the diagnosis of asthma is made, short -term peak expiratory flow (PEF) monitoring may be used to assess \nresponse to treatment, to evaluate triggers (including at work) for worsening symptoms, or to establish a baseline for action plans. After starting ICS, personal best PEF (from twice daily readings) is reached on average within 2 weeks.\n168 Average PEF continues to increase, and diurnal PEF variability to decrease, for about 3  months.158,168 \nExcessive variation in PEF suggests suboptimal asthma control, and increases the risk of exacerbations.169 \nLong- term PEF monitoring is now generally only recommended for patients with severe asthma, or those with impaired \nperception of airflow limitation (e.g. few symptoms despite low initial lung function) .152,170-173 For clinical practice, \ndisplaying PEF results on a standardized chart may improve accuracy of interpretation.174 \nHome spirometric monitoring has been used in some clinical trials; careful training of patients in spirometric technique is essential. Results from clinic -based and home- recorded spirometry are not interchangeable.  \nASSESSING ASTHMA SEVERITY  \nThe current concept of asthma severity is based on ‘difficulty to treat’  \nThe current concept of asthma severity, recommended by an ATS/ERS Task Force38,84 and included in most asthma \nguidelines, is that asthma severity should be assessed retrospectively from how difficult the patient’s asthma is to treat. This is reflected by the level of treatment required to control the patient’s symptoms and exacerbations, i.e., after at least several months of treatment .\n38,84 ,175 This definition is mainly relevant to, and useful for, severe asthma.  \nBy this definition:  \n• severe asthma is defined as asthma that remains uncontrolled despite optimized treatment with high- dose ICS -\nLABA, or that requires high -dose ICS -LABA to prevent it from becoming uncontrolled. Severe asthma must be \ndistinguished from asthma that is difficult to treat due to inadequate or inappropriate treatment, or persistent problems with adherence or comorbidities such as chronic rhinosinusitis or obesity,\n175 as they need very different \ntreatment compared with if asthma is relatively refractory to high- dose ICS -LABA or even oral corticosteroids \nCOPYRIGHTED MATERIAL - DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE"

For example, asthma is commonly called ‘severe’ \nif patients have frequent or troublesome asthma symptoms, regardless of their treatment, and ‘mild asthma’ is \ncommonly used if patients do not have daily symptoms or if symptoms are quickly relieved.  \nIn epidemiological studies  and clinical trials , asthma is often classified as ‘mild’, ‘moderate’ or ‘severe’ based only on \nthe prescribed treatment by GINA or BTS Step, regardless of patients’ level of asthma control. This assumes that the prescribed treatment was appropriate for the patient’s needs, but asthma is often under -treated or over -treated.  \nMost clinical trials of biologic therapy  enroll patients with asthma that is uncontrolled despite taking medium- or high-\ndose ICS -LABA, but contributory factors such as incorrect inhaler technique, poor adherence, or comorbidities are \nrarely assessed and treated before the patient’s eligibility for enrolment  is considered.\n176,177 Some clinical trial \nparticipants may therefore have ‘difficult -to-treat’, rather than severe asthma.  \nSome  g uidelines  178,179 also retain an other , older , classification of asthma severity based on symptom and SABA \nfrequency, night waking, lung function and exacerbations before ICS -containing treatment is started.38,84 This \nclassification also distinguishes between ‘intermittent’ and ‘mild persistent’ asthma, but this historical distinction was arbitrary: it was not evidence- based, but was based on an untested assumption that patients with symptoms \n≤2 days/week were not at risk and would not benefit from ICS, so should be treated with SABA alone. However, it is \nnow known that patients with so- called ‘intermittent’ asthma can have severe or fatal exacerbations,\n180,181 and that \ntheir risk is substantially reduced by ICS- containing treatment compared with SABA alone.182-184 Although this \nsymptom- based classification is stated to apply to patients not on ICS -containing treatment,178,179 it is often used for \npatients taking these medications. This can cause confusion, as a patient’s asthma may be classified differently, and they may be prescribed different treatment, depending on which definition the clinician or healthcare system uses.  \nFor lo\nw -resource countries  without access to effective medications such as ICS, the World Health Organization \ndefinition of severe asthma185 includes a category of ‘untreated severe asthma’. This category corresponds to \nuncontrolled asthma in patients not taking any ICS -containing treatment.  \nThe patient’s view of asthma severity  \nPatients may perceive their asthma as severe if they have intense or frequent symptoms, but this does not necessarily indicate underlying severe disease, as symptoms and lung function can rapidly become well controlled with \ncommencement of ICS- containing treatment, or improved inhaler technique or adherence.\n38,84 Likewise, patients often \nperceive their asthma as mild if they have symptoms that are easily relieved by SABA, or that are infrequent.38,84 Of \nconcern, patients often interpret the term ‘mild asthma’ to mean that they are not at risk of severe exacerbations and \ndo not need to take ICS- containing treatment. This is often described as patients ‘underestimating’ their asthma \nseverity, but instead it reflects their different interpretation of the words ‘severity’ and ‘mild’ compared with the \nacademic usage of these terms.38,84 \nHow useful is the current retrospective definition of asthma severity?  \nThe retrospective definition of severe asthma based on ‘difficulty to treat’ has been widely accepted in guidelines and \nin specialist clinical practice. It has obvious clinical utility as it identifies patients who, because of their burden of \ndisease and incomplete response to optimized conventional ICS -based treatment, may benefit from referral to a \nCOPYRIGHTED MATERIAL - DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE"

It is appropriate to classify asthma as ‘difficult -to-treat’ rather than severe if \nthere are modifiable factors such as incorrect inhaler technique, poor adherence or untreated comorbidities, because asthma may become well controlled when such issues are addressed.\n38,84,175 \nBy contrast, the clinical utility of the retrospective definition of mild asthma  is much less clear. There is substantial \nvariation in opinions about the specific criteria that should be used, for example whether FEV 1 should be ≥80% \npredicted in order for asthma to be considered ‘mild’, and whether the occurrence of any exacerbation precludes a patient’s asthma being classified as ‘mild’ for the next 12 months.\n186 There are too few studies of the underlying \npathology to discern whether isolated exacerbations necessarily imply greater inherent severity, especially given the \ncontribution of external triggers such as viral infections or allergen exposure to sporadic exacerbations.  \nFurther, by this definition, asthma can be classified as ‘mild’ only after several months of ICS -c ontaining treatment, and \nonly if asthma is well  controlled on low -dose ICS or as -needed low -dose ICS -formoterol, so this definition clearly \ncannot be applied to patients with uncontrolled or partly controlled symptoms who are taking SABA.  \nFinally, retrospective classification of asthma as mild appears of little value in deciding on future treatment. In addition,  \nin the studies of as -needed ICS -formoterol, baseline patient characteristics such as daily reliever use, lower lung \nfunction or history of exacerbations (or even baseline blood eosinophils or FeNO) did not identify patients who should \ninstead be treated with daily ICS.187,188 Instead, decisions about ongoing treatment should be based upon the large \nevidence base about the efficacy and effectiveness of as -needed ICS -formoterol or daily ICS, together with an \nindividualized assessment of the patient’s symptom control, exacerbation risk, predictors of response, and patient \npreferences (see Box 3-3 , p.53). \nH\nowever, the most urgent problem with the term ‘mild asthma’, regardless of how it is defined, is that it encourages \ncomplacency, since both patients and clinicians often interpret ‘mild asthma’ to mean that the patient is at low risk and \ndoes not need ICS -containing treatment. However, up to 30% of asthma exacerbations and deaths occur in people \nwith infrequent symptoms, for example, less than weekly or only on strenuous exercise.180,181 \nInterim advice about asthma severity descriptors  \nFor clinical practice  \nGINA continues to support the current definition of severe asthma as asthma that remains uncontrolled despite optimized treatment with high- dose ICS -LABA, or that requires high- dose ICS -LABA or biologic therapy to prevent it \nfrom becoming uncontrolled. GINA also maintains the clinically important distinction between difficult -to-treat and \nsevere asthma. See Box 2- 4 (p.47) and Section 8 (p. 139) for more detail about assessment and management of \ndifficult -to-treat and severe asthma. For patients who have had a good asthma response to biologic therapy, it may be \nhelpful  for administrative  reasons to describe their asthma as, e.g., ‘severe eosinophilic asthma, well  controlled on \n[therapy]’ , to indicate that the biologic therapy is needed to maintain their improved status . For discussion about the \nrelated concept of asthma remission on treatment , see p. 50. \nWe suggest that in clinical practice, the term ‘ mild asthma’ should generally be avoided if possible , because of the \ncommon but mistaken assumption by patients and clinicians that it equates to low risk, and that ICS treatment is not \nneeded. Instead, assess each patient’s symptom control and risk factors on their current treatment (Box 2- 1, p.36), as \nwell as multimorbidity and patient goals and preferences. Explain that patients with infrequent or mild asthma symptoms can still have severe or fatal exacerbations if treated with SABA alone,\n180,181 and that this risk is reduced by \nhalf to two- thirds with low -dose ICS or with as -needed low -dose ICS formoterol.182,183 Ensure that you prescribe ICS-\ncontaining therapy to reduce the patient’s risk of severe exacerbations (Box 4-3 , p.74), and treat any modifiable risk \nf\nactors or comorbidities using pharmacologic or non- pharmacologic strategies (see Box 3-5 , p.55 and Box 3-6 , p.57). \n‘Mild asthma’ is a retrospective label, so it cannot be used to decide which treatment patients should receive. Advice \nhas been provided in Section 4 about which patients are suitable for low intensity treatment (Step 1 and 2).  \nFor health professional education  \nThe term ‘ apparently mild asthma’ may be useful to highlight the discordance between symptoms and risk , i.e., that \npatients with infrequent  or mild symptoms , who might therefore appear to have mild asthma, can still have severe or \nfatal exacerbations. However, ‘ apparently mild asthma’ in English can easily be mistranslated into  some languages as  \nCOPYRIGHTED MATERIAL - DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE"

Alternative phrases include ‘asthma that \nseems to be mild’. \nRegardless of the term used, explain that ‘asthma control ’ tools such as ACQ and ACT assess only one domain of \nasthma control, and only over a short period of time ( see Assessing asthma symptom control, p. 38), and that patients \nwith infrequent interval symptoms are over -represented in studies of severe, near -fatal and fatal asthma \nexacerbations.180,181 Always emphasize the need for and benefit from ICS -containing treatment in patients with \nasthma, regardless of their symptom frequency  or severity, and even if they have no obvious additional risk factors.  \nFor epidemiologic studies  \nI\nf clinical details are not available, describe the prescribed (or dispensed) treatment, without imputing severity, \ne.g., ‘patients prescribed SABA with no ICS’ rather than ‘mild asthma’. Since treatment options change over time, and \nmay differ between guidelines, state the actual treatment class, rather than a treatment Step (e.g., ‘low -dose \nmaintenance- and-reliever  therapy with ICS -formoterol’ rather than ‘Step 3 treatment’).  \nFor clinical trials  \nDescribe the patient population by their level of asthma control and treatment, e.g., ‘patients with uncontrolled asthma \ndespite medium- dose ICS -LABA plus as -needed SABA’ rather than ‘moderate asthma’.  \nFurther discussion is clearly needed  \nGiven the importance of mild asthma and the discordance between its current academic definition and the various \nways that the term is used in clinical practice, GINA is continuing to discuss these issues with a wide range of \nstakeholders. The aim is to obtain agreement among patients, health professionals, researchers, industry and \nregulators about the implications for clinical practice and clinical research of current knowledge about asthma \npathophysiology and treatment,38,84 and whether/how the term ‘mild asthma’ should be used in the future. Pending the \noutcomes of this discussion, no change has been made to use of the term ‘mild asthma’ elsewhere in this GINA Strategy Report.  \nHOW TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN UNCONTROLLED ASTHMA AND SEVERE ASTHMA  \nAlthough good symptom control and minimal exacerbations can usually be achieved with ICS -containing treatment, \nsome patients will not achieve one or both of these goals even with a long period of high- dose therapy.160,175 In some \npatients this is due to truly refractory severe asthma, but in many others, it is due to incorrect inhaler technique, poor adherence, over -use of SABA, comorbidities, persistent environmental exposures, or psychosocial factors.  \nIt is important to distinguish between severe asthma and uncontrolled asthma, because l\n ack of asthma control is a \nmuch more common reason for persistent symptoms and exacerbations, and may be more easily improved. Box 2- 4 \n(p.47) shows the initial steps that can be carried out in primary care to identify common causes of uncontrolled \nasthma. More details are given in Section 8 (p. 139) about investigation and management of difficult -to-treat and \nsevere asthma, including referral to a respiratory physician or severe asthma clinic where possible, and use of add- on \ntreatment including biologic therapy.  \nThe most common problems that need to be excluded before making a diagnosis of severe asthma are:  \n• Poor inhaler technique (up to 80% of community patients)91 (Box 5-2, p.110) \n• Poor medication adherence189,190 (Box 5-3, p.112) \n• Incorrect diagnosis of asthma, with symptoms due to alternative conditions such as inducible laryngeal obstruction, cardiac failure or lack of fitness (Box 1-3 , p.27) \n• Multimorbidity such as rhinosinusitis, GERD, obesity and obstructive sleep apnea\n93,191 (Section 6, p. 117) \n• Ongoing exposure to sensitizing or irritant agents in the home or work environment, including tobacco smoke. \nCOPYRIGHTED MATERIAL - DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE"

Principles of asthma management in adults, adolescents and \nchildren 6– 11 years \nKEY POINTS  \nThe patient -health professional partnership  \n• Effective asthma management requires a partnership between the person with asthma (or the parent/caregiver) \nand their healthcare providers.  \n• Teaching communication skills to healthcare providers may lead to increased patient satisfaction, better health \noutcomes, and reduced use of healthcare resources.  \n• The patient’s ability to obtain, process and understand basic health information to make appropriate health \ndecisions (‘ health literacy ’) should be considered. \nGoals of asthma management  \nThe GINA goal of asthma management is to achieve the best possible long- term outcomes for the individual patient . \nThis may include good long -term symptom control ( few/no asthma symptoms, no sleep disturbance due to asthma, \nand unimpaired physical activity), and minimized long- term risk of asthma- related mortality, exacerbations, persistent \nairflow limitation and side- effects of treatment. The patient’s own goals should also be identified.  \nRemission of asthma  \n• Remission of asthma can be identified in children and in adults, either clinical remission or complete remission, \nand either off -treatment or on- treatment. Definitions and criteria vary.  \n• The concept of clinical remission on treatment is consistent with the long-term goal of asthma management \npromoted by GINA, to achieve the best possible long- term asthma outcomes for each patient.    \n• Research among patients who have (or have not) experienced clinical or complete remission of asthma, either off -\ntreatment or on- treatment, provides important opportunities for understanding underlying mechanisms of asthma, \nto develop new approaches to asthma prevention and management. This will be facilitated by using standardized \ncriteria and assessment tools.  \n• Take care if using the term ‘ remission ’ in conversations with patients or parents/caregivers, as they may assume it \nmeans a cure, or may associate it with cancer or leukemia. Explain what you mean, and that if asthma symptoms \nhave gone quiet for a while, they may recur.  \nMaking decisions about asthma treatment  \n• Asthma treatment is adjusted in a continual cycle of assessment, treatment, and review of the patient’s response \nin both symptom control and future risk (of exacerbations and side- effects), and of patient preferences.  \n• For population- level decisions about asthma medications, e.g., national guidelines, insurers, health \nmaintenance organizations or national formularies, the ‘preferred’ regimens in Steps 1–4 represent the best \ntreatments for most patients, based on evidence from randomized controlled trials, meta- analyses and \nobservational studies about safety, efficacy and effectiveness, with a particular emphasis on symptom burden and \nexacerbation risk. For Steps 1– 5, there are different preferred population- level recommendations for different age-\ngroups (adults/adolescents, children 6– 11 years, children 5 years and younger). In Step 5, there are also different \npreferred population- level recommendations depending on the inflammatory phenotype, Type 2 or non- Type 2.  \n• For individual patients , shared decision- making about treatment should also consider  any patient characteristics \nor phenotype or environmental exposures that predict the patient’s risk of exacerbations or other adverse \noutcomes, or their likely response to treatment, together with the patient’s goals or concerns and practical issues \n(inhaler technique, adherence, medication access and cost to the patient).  \n• O ptimize asthma management, including inhaled therapy  and non- pharmacologic strategies, to reduce the need \nfor oral corticosteroids (OCS) and their  multiple associated adverse effects.  \nCOPYRIGHTED MATERIAL - DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE"

        "text": "49 THE PATIENT– HEALTHCARE PROVIDER PARTNERSHIP  \nEffective asthma management requires the development of a partnership between the person with asthma (or the \nparent/caregiver) and healthcare providers.192 This should enable the person with asthma to gain the knowledge, \nconfidence and skills to assume a major role in the management of their asthma. Self -management education reduces \nasthma morbidity in both adults193 (Evidence A) and children194 (Evidence  A). \nThere is emerging evidence that shared decision- making is associated with improved outcomes.195 Patients  and \ncaregivers  should be encouraged to participate in decisions about treatment, and given the opportunity to express \ntheir expectations and concerns. This partnership needs to be individualized for each patient. A person’s willingness and ability to engage in self -management may vary depending on factors such as ethnicity, literacy, understanding of \nhealth concepts (health literacy), numeracy, beliefs about asthma and medications, desire for autonomy, and the \nhealthcare system.  \nGood communication  \nGood communication by healthcare  providers is essential as the basis for good outcomes (Evidence B).196-198 \nTeaching healthcare providers to improve their communication skills (Box 3- 1) can result in increased patient \nsatisfaction, better health outcomes, and reduced use of healthcare resources196-198 without lengthening consultation \ntimes.199 It can also enhance patient adherence.199 Training patients to give information clearly, seek information, and \ncheck their understanding of information provided is also associated with improved adherence with treatment \nrecommendations.199 \nBox 3- 1. Communication strategies for healthcare  providers  \nKey strategies to facilitate good communication197,198 \n• A congenial demeanor (friendliness, humor and attentiveness)  \n• Allowing the patient to express their goals, beliefs and concerns  \n• Empathy, reassurance, and prompt handling of any concerns  \n• Giving encouragement and praise  \n• Giving appropriate (personalized) information  \n• Providing feedback and review  \nHow to reduce the impact of low health literacy200 \n• Order information from most to least important.  \n• Speak slowly and use simple words (avoid medical language, if possible).  \n• Simplify numeric concepts (e.g., use numbers instead of percentages).  \n• Frame instructions effectively (use illustrative anecdotes, drawings, pictures, table or graphs).  \n• Confirm understanding by using the ‘teach- back’ method (ask patients to repeat instructions).  \n• Ask a second person (e.g., nurse, family member) to repeat the main messages.  \n• Pay attention to non- verbal communication by the patient.  \n• Make patients feel comfortable about asking questions.  \nHealth literacy and asthma  \nThere is increasing recognition of the impact of low health literacy on health outcomes, including in asthma.200,201 \nHealth literacy means much more than the ability to read: it is defined as ‘the degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic health information and services to make appropriate health decisions’.\n200 Low health literacy is associated with reduced knowledge and worse asthma control.202 In one study, low \nnumeracy among parents of children with asthma was associated with higher risk of exacerbations.201 Interventions \nadapted for cultural and ethnicity perspectives have been associated with improved knowledge and significant improvements in inhaler technique.\n203 Suggested communication strategies for reducing the impact of low health \nliteracy are shown in Box 3 -1 (p.49). \nCOPYRIGHTED MATERIAL - DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE"

This includes \npreventing exacerbations, accelerated decline in lung function, and medication adverse effects. At a population level, \nthe goals of asthma management also include minimizing asthma deaths, urgent health care utilization, and the \nsocioeconomic impacts of uncontrolled asthma.  \nIt is also important to elicit the patient’s (or parent/caregiver’s) goals regarding their asthma, as these may differ from \nmedical goals. Shared goals for asthma management can be achieved in various ways, with consideration of  differing \nhealthcare systems, medication availability, and cultural and personal preferences.  \nBox 3- 2. Long -term goal of asthma management  \nThe goal of asthma management is to achieve the best possible long -term asthma outcomes for the patient: \n• Long- term asthma symptom control, which may include:  \n- Few/no asthma symptoms  \n- No sleep disturbance due to asthma  \n- Unimpaired physical activity  \n• Long- term asthma risk minimization, which may include:   \n- No exacerbations  \n- Improved or stable personal best lung function  \n- No requirement for maintenance systemic corticosteroids  \n- No medication side- effects . \nThe patient’s goals  for their asthma may be different from these medical goals; ask the patient what they want \nfrom their asthma treatment.  \nWhen discussing  the best possible asthma outcomes with a patient , consider  their goals, their asthma \nphenotype, clinical features, multimorbidity, risk factors (including severity of airflow limitation) , practical issues \nincluding the availability  and cost of medications, and the potential adverse effects of treatment (Box 3- 4, p.54) .  \nAssessing symptom control is NOT enough: the patient’s risk factors (Box 2- 2B, p. 37), including history of \nexacerbations, should always also be assessed.  \nSymptom control and risk may be discordant:  patients with few or no symptoms can still have severe or fatal \nexacerbations, including from external triggers such as viral infections, allergen exposure (if sensitized) or pollution.  \nREMISSION OF ASTHMA  \nRemission of asthma has been investigated extensively in the past, most commonly remission of childhood asthma off treatment. Definitions and criteria vary, but they commonly refer to either clinical remission  (e.g., no asthma symptoms \nor exacerbations for a specific period) or complete (or pathophysiological) remission (e.g., also including normal lung \nfunction, airway responsiveness and/or inflammatory markers). There has been interest in remission off treatment , and \nremission on treatment , for example with biologic therapy for severe asthma.\n204-206 The concept of clinical remission on \ntreatment is consistent with the long-term goal of asthma management  promoted by GINA, which is to achieve the \nbest possible long- term asthma outcomes for the patient (see Box 3- 2, p.50). W hen discussing the best possible \noutcomes with a patient, consider their own asthma goals, their asthma phenotype, clinical features, multimorbidity, \nrisk factors (including severity of airflow limitation), practical issues including the availability and cost of medications, \nand the potential adverse effects of treatment (Box 3 -4, p.54). \nResearch in patients who have (or have not) experienced clinical or complete remission of asthma, either off  treatment \nor on treatment, provides important opportunities for understanding the heterogeneous and interconnected underlying \nmechanisms of asthma, and for developing new approaches to asthma prevention and management.

        "text": "51 Remission of childhood asthma  \nReported rates of r emission off treatment  from studies in children with wheezing or asthma vary depending on the \npopulations, definitions, and length of follow -up. For example, in one study, 59% of wheezing preschool children had \nno wheezing at 6 years,207 whereas in another study, only 15% of children with persistent wheezing at/after 9 years \nhad no wheezing at 26 years.208 Clinical remission is more frequent than pathophysiological remission at all \nages.209,210 \nThe most important predictors of asthma remission in school -aged children are fewer, milder or decreasing frequency \nof symptomatic episodes,211-214 good or improving lung function, and less airway hyperresponsiveness.210 Risk factors \nfor persistence of childhood asthma include atopy, parental asthma/allergy, later onset of symptoms, wheezing without \ncolds, and maternal smoking or tobacco smoke exposure.  \nRemission is not cure : af ter remission in childhood or adolescence, asthma often recurs later in life. C hildren whose \nasthma has remitted have an increased risk of accelerated lung decline in adulthood, independent from, but \nsynergistic with, tobacco smoking; and they may develop persistent airflow limitation, although this is less likely than for those whose asthma has persisted.\n215 This suggests the importance of monitoring lung function in people with \nremission of asthma symptoms.  \nTo dat e , there is no evidence that interventions in childhood increase the likelihood of remission of asthma or reduce \nthe risk of recurrence. However, treatment of asthma in childhood with inhaled corticosteroid ( ICS) substantially \nreduces the burden of asthma on the child and family, reduces absence from school and social events, reduces the risk of exacerbations and hospitalizations, and allows the child to participate in normal physical activity.  \nParents/caregivers often ask if their child will grow out of their asthma,  and will not need treatment in the future. \nCurrent consensus supports the following advice for discussions like these:  \n• If the child has no reported symptoms, check for evidence of ongoing disease activity  (e.g., wheezing; child \navoiding physical activity ), and check  lung function if testing  is available. \n• Use a description like ‘asthma has gone quiet for the present ’ to help avoid misunderstandings. If you use the \nterm ‘remission’ with parents/caregivers, explain the medical meaning, because it is often interpreted as \nmeaning a permanent cure. \n• Advise parents/caregivers that , even if the child’s symptoms resolve completely, their asthma may recur later . \n• Emphasize the benefits of taking controller treatment for the child’s current health, their risk of asthma attacks, \nand their ability to participate in school and sporting activities, while avoiding claims about effect of therapy on \nfuture asthma outcomes.  \nResearch needs: clinical questions about remission off treatment in children focus on the risk factors for asthma \npersistence and recurrence  (including clinical, pathological , and genetic factors ), the effect of risk reduction strategies  \non the likelihood of remission, whether monitoring after remission to allow early identification of asthma recurrence \nimproves outcomes , and whether progression to persistent airflow limitation can be prevented.  Clinical questions  \nabout  remission on treatment ( e.g., in children with severe asthma treated with biologic therapy ) include investigating \nwhether inhaled anti -inflammatory therapy can be down- titrated.  \nRemission of adult asthma  \nClinical or complete remission off treatment  has been observed in some adults, either spontaneously or after cessation \nof controller treatment. For example, 15.9% of patients with adult -onset asthma experienced clinical remission (no \nasthma symptoms and no asthma medications) within 5 years.25 Remission is sometimes seen in people with \noccupational asthma after cessation of exposure.216 Clinical remission of asthma in adult life is more common with \nchildhood- onset asthma than adult -onset asthma. However, persistence of airway hyperresponsiveness and/or airway \ninflammation is found in most adults with clinical remission of asthma.209 \nIn recent years, there has been increasing interest in asthma remission on treatment , particularly with biologic therapy \nfor severe asthma. Various definitions have been proposed. For clinical remission, these often include criteria such as no asthma symptoms, no exacerbations, no use of OCS, and stable or improving lung function, over a defined prolonged period. For complete remission, normalization of airway responsiveness and/or inflammatory markers has \nbeen proposed.  \nCOPYRIGHTED MATERIAL - DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE"

If the patient experiences clinical remission, explain that this does not mean permanent cure, and that they should not stop taking any of their asthma medications  except on medical advice. \nResearch needs:  for asthma remission on treatment in adults include the association between clinical criteria with \nbiomarkers, imaging, or pathology samples (including for ‘omics ’ analysis) that may reflect the underlying disease \nprocesses, and investigation of predictors of long- term remission or recurrence. The framework for validating proposed \ncriteria for remission on treatment will depend on their intended purpose, for example as an assessment tool in clinical practice, for prognosis of continued long- term stability, or for identifying new targets for therapy. Clinical and qualitative \nresearch with a range of treatments is needed to know whether aiming for remission will improve long- term outcomes \nfor patients with asthma.  \nPERSONALIZED CONTROL -BASED ASTHMA MANAGEMENT  \nAsthma control has two domains: symptom control and risk reduction (see Box 2- 2, p.37). In control -based asthma \nmanagement, pharmacological and non- pharmacological treatment is adjusted in a continual cycle that involves \nassessment  of symptom control and risk factors, treatment and review by appropriately trained personnel (Box 3-3 , \np.53) to achieve the goals of asthma treatment (Section 3, p. 48). Asthma outcomes have been shown to improve after \nthe introduction of control -based guidelines219,220 or practical tools for implementation of control -based management \nstrategies.195,221 \nThe concept of control -based management is also supported by the design of most randomized controlled medication \ntrials, in which patients are identified for a change in asthma treatment based on features of poor symptom control with \nor without other risk factors such as low lung function or a history of exacerbations. Since  2014, GINA asthma \nmanagement has focused not only on asthma symptom control, but also on personalized management of the patient’s \nmodifiable risk factors for exacerbations, other adverse outcomes and multimorbidity, while  also considering the \npatient’s preferences and goals.  Non- modifiable risk factors , such as a history of past ICU admission, should also be \ndocumented. \nFor many patients in primary care, achieving good symptom control is a good guide to a reduced risk of \nexacerbations.222 When ICS s were introduced into asthma management, large improvements were observed in \nsymptom control and lung function, and exacerbations and asthma- related mortality also decreased.  \nHowever, patients with few or intermittent symptoms may be still at risk of severe exacerbations182 (Box 2 -2B, \np.37). In addition, some patients continue to have exacerbations despite well -c ontrolled symptoms, and for patients \nwith ongoing symptoms, side- effects may be an issue if ICS doses continue to be stepped up. Therefore, in control -\nbased management, both domains of asthma control (symptom control and future risk ; Box 2-2, p.37) should be \nconsidered when choosing asthma treatment and reviewing the response.38,84 \nCOPYRIGHTED MATERIAL - DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE"

The asthma management cycle for personalized asthma care  \n \nPersonalized asthma management involves a continual cycle of assessment, adjustment of treatment and review   \n(Box 3 -2, p.50): \n• ASSESS the patient’s symptom control and their risk factors for exacerbations, for decline in lung function and for \nmedication adverse effects (Box 2- 2, p.37), with particular attention to inhaler technique and adherence. Assess \ncomorbidities and the patient’s goals and preferences, and confirm the diagnosis of asthma if not yet done.  \n• ADJUST  the patient’s management, based on these assessments.

Population- level recommendations aim to represent the best \noption for most patients in the particular population. At each treatment step, ‘ preferred’ controller and reliever \nregimens are recommended that provide the best benefit -to-risk ratio for both symptom control and risk reduction. \nChoice of the preferred controller and/or preferred reliever is based on evidence from efficacy studies (highly \ncontrolled studies in well -characterized populations) and effectiveness studies (from pragmatically controlled \nstudies, or studies in broader populations, or strong observational data),223 with a particular focus on symptoms \nand exacerbation risk.

        "text": "67 4. Medications and strategies for adults, adolescents and children\n6–11 years\nKEY POINTS  \n•For safety, GINA does not recommend treatment of asthma in adults, adolescents or children 6– 11 years with\nshort -acting beta 2 agonist ( SABA) alone. Instead, they should receive inhaled corticosteroid ( ICS)-containing\ntreatment to reduce their risk of serious exacerbations and to control symptoms.\n•ICS-containing treatment can be delivered either with regular daily treatment or, in adults and adolescents who\nhave asthma symptoms less than daily and normal or mildly reduced lung function, with as -needed low -dose ICS -\nformoterol taken whenever needed for symptom relief. For children not likely to be adherent with maintenance\nICS, the ICS can be taken whenever the child uses their SABA reliever.\n•Reduction in severe exacerbations is a high priority across treatment steps, to reduce the risk and burden to\npatients and the burden to the health system, and to reduce the need for oral corticosteroids (OCS), which have\ncumulative long- term adverse effects.\n•Tables of low, medium or high dose ICS do not represent equivalent potency. If a patient is switched from one\nmedication to another, monitor them for stability.\nTreatment tracks for adults and adolescents  \n•For clarity, the treatment figure for adults and adolescents shows two ‘tracks’, largely based on th e choice of\nreliever. Treatment may be stepped up or down within a track using the same reliever at each step, or treatment\nmay be switched between tracks, according to the individual patient’s needs.\n•Track 1, in which the reliever is low -dose ICS -formoterol , is the preferred approach recommended by GINA.\nWhen a patient at any step has asthma symptoms, they use low -dose ICS -formoterol as needed for symptom\nrelief. In Steps 3 –5, they also take ICS -formoterol as regular daily treatment. This approach is preferred because it\nreduces the risk of severe exacerbations compared with using a SABA reliever, with similar symptom control, and\nbecause of the simplicity for patients and clinicians of needing only a single medication across treatment Steps 1–\n4.\n•Medications and doses for Track 1 are explained in Box 4-8 , p.84, including the maximum recommended total\nformoterol (with ICS) dose in any day for each formulation. Based on extensive evidence with budesonide-\nformoterol, GINA suggests that the same maximum total daily dose should apply for beclometasone- formoterol.\n•Track 2, in which the reliever is an ICS- SABA or SABA, is an alternative if Track 1 is not possible, or if a patient\nis stable, with good adherence and no exacerbations in the past year on their current therapy. In Step 1, the\npatient takes a SABA and a low -dose ICS together for symptom relief (in combination if available, or with the ICS\ntaken immediately after the SABA). In Steps 2– 5, the reliever is a SABA or combination ICS -SABA. Before\nconsidering a SABA reliever, consider whether the patient is likely to be adherent with their ICS -containing\ntreatment, as otherwise they would be at higher risk of exacerbations.\nSteps 1 and 2  for adults and adolescents  \n•Track 1:  (Steps 1– 2 combined) In adults and adolescents who were considered by their clinician to have mild\nasthma, and were taking SABA alone or had controlled asthma on daily low -dose ICS or LTRA, treatment with as -\nneeded- only low -dose ICS -formoterol reduced the risk of severe exacerbations and emergency department visits\nor hospitalizations by about two- thirds compared with SABA -only treatment. As -needed- only low -dose ICS -\nformoterol reduced the risk of emergency department visits and hospitalizations compared with daily ICS, with no\nclinically important difference in symptom control. In patients previously using SABA alone, as -needed low -dose\nICS-formoterol also significantly reduced the risk of severe exacerbations needing OCS, compared with daily ICS.\n•Track 2: Treatment with regular daily low -dose ICS plus as -needed SABA (Step 2) , if taken,  is highly effective in\nreducing asthma symptoms and reducing the risk of asthma- related exacerbations, hospitalization and death.\nHowever, adherence with ICS in the community is poor, leaving patients taking SABA alone and at increased risk\nCOPYRIGHTED MATERIAL - DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE"

For patients with infrequent symptoms , who are likely to have very poor adherence, as -needed-\nonly ICS -SABA with separate or combination inhalers is the best option for Step 1, although current evidence is \nlimited to small studies that were not powered to detect differences in exacerbation rates.  \nConsider s tep-up if asthma remains uncontrolled despite good adherence and inhaler technique \n•Before considering any step up, first confirm that the symptoms are due to asthma and identify and address\ncommon problems  such as inhaler technique, adherence, allergen exposure and multimorbidity; provide patient\neducation.\n•For adults and adolescents, the preferred Step 3 treatment is the Track 1 regimen with low -dose ICS -formoterol as\nmaintenance- and-reliever therapy (MART). This reduces the risk of severe exacerbations, with similar or better\nsymptom control, compared with maintenance treatment using a combination of an ICS and a long- acting beta 2\nagonist (LABA) as controller, plus as -needed SABA. If needed, the maintenance dose of ICS -formoterol can be\nincreased to medium (i.e. , Step 4) by increasing the number of maintenance inhalations. MART is also a preferred\ntreatment option at Steps 3 and 4 for children 6– 11 years, with a lower dose ICS -formoterol inhaler.\n•ICS-formoterol should not be used as the reliever for patients taking a different ICS -LABA maintenance treatment,\nbecause clinical evidence for safety and efficacy is lacking.\n•Other Step 3 options for adults and adolescents in Track 2, and in children, include maintenance ICS -LABA plus\nas-needed SABA or plus as -needed ICS -SABA (if available) or, for children 6– 11 years, medium- dose ICS plus as -\nneeded SABA. For children, try other controller options at the same step before stepping up.\nStep down to find the minimum effective treatment  \n•Once good asthma control has been achieved and maintained for 2 –3 months, consider stepping down gradually\nto find the patient’s lowest treatment that controls both symptoms and exacerbations .\n•Provide the patient with a written asthma action plan, monitor closely, and schedule a follow -up visit.\n•Do not completely withdraw ICS unless this is needed temporarily to confirm the diagnosis of asthma.\nFor all patients with asthma, provide asthma education and training in essential skills  \n•After choosing the right class of medication for the patient, the choice of inhaler device depends on which inhalers\nare available for the patient for that medication, which of these inhalers the patient can use correctly after training,\nand their relative environmental impact. Check inhaler technique frequently.\n•Provide inhaler skills training: this is essential for medications to be effective, but technique is often incorrect.\n•Encourage adherence with ICS-containing medication, even when symptoms are infrequent.\n•Provide training in asthma self -management (self -monitoring of symptoms and/or peak expiratory flow (PEF),\nwritten asthma action plan and regular medical review) to control symptoms and minimize the risk of\nexacerbations.\nFor patients with one or more risk factors for exacerbations  \n•Prescribe ICS -containing medication, preferably from Track 1 options, i.e., with as -needed low -dose ICS -\nformoterol as reliever; provide a written asthma action plan; and arrange review more frequently than for lower -risk\npatients.\n•Identify and address modifiable risk factors (e.g., smoking, low lung function, over -use of SABA).\n•Consider non- pharmacological strategies and interventions to assist with symptom control and risk reduction,\n(e.g.,  smoking cessation advice, breathing exercises, some avoidance strategies).\nDifficult -to-treat and severe asthma (see S ection 8, p.139) \n•Patients who have poor symptom control and/or exacerbations, despite medium- or high- dose ICS -LABA\ntreatment, should be assessed for contributing factors, and asthma treatment optimized.\n•If the problems continue or diagnosis is uncertain, refer to a specialist center for phenotypic assessment and\nconsideration of add- on therapy including biologics.\nCOPYRIGHTED MATERIAL - DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE"

This is called\n“maintenance- and-reliever therapy ” (MART). The dose and regimen of controller medications should be optimized\nto minimize the risk of medication side- effects, including risks of needing OCS.\n•Reliever medications: a ll patients should be provided with a reliever inhaler for as -needed relief of breakthrough\nsymptoms, including during worsening asthma or exacerbations. They are also recommended for short -term\nprevention of exercise- induced bronchoconstriction (EIB).\nRelievers include the anti -inflammatory relievers ICS -formoterol and ICS- SABA, and SABA. Combination ICS -\nLABA with non- formoterol LABAs cannot be used as a reliever, due to a slower onset of action (e.g. , ICS-\nsalmeterol), or due to lack of safety and/or efficacy with more than once- daily use (e.g. , ICS-vilanterol, ICS -\nindacaterol). ICS -formoterol should not be used as the reliever for patients taking maintenance ICS -LABA with a\nnon-formoterol LABA.14\nOver -use of SABA (e.g., dispensing of three or more 200- dose canisters in a year, corresponding to average use\nmore than daily) increases the risk of asthma exacerbations.86,87 Regular SABA also increases the risk of poor\nsymptom control.293\n•Add-on therapies including for patients with severe asthma  (Section 8, p.139 ).\nWhen compared with medications used for other chronic diseases, most of the medications used for treatment of asthma have very favorable therapeutic ratios.

Examples include ICS -containing \nmedications (ICS, ICS -LABA, ICS -LABA- LAMA), as well as LTRA\n† \nand biologic therapy.  \nThe term ‘maintenance’ describes the prescribed frequency of \nadministration, not a particular class of asthma medicine.  \nController  Medication targeting both domains of asthma control (symptom control and future risk)  In the past, ‘controller’ was largely used for ICS -containing \nmedications prescribed for regular daily treatment, so ‘controller’ and ‘maintenance’ became almost synonymous. However, this became confusing after the introduction of combination ICS -containing \nrelievers for as -needed use.  \nTo avoid confusion, ‘ICS -containing treatment’ and ‘maintenance \ntreatment’ have been substituted as appropriate where the intended \nmeaning was unclear.  \nReliever  Asthma inhaler taken as needed, for quick relief of asthma symptoms  Sometimes called rescue inhalers. As well as being used for symptom relief, reliever inhalers can also be used before exercise, to prevent exercise- induced asthma symptoms.  \nIncludes SABAs (e.g., salbutamol [albuterol], terbutaline, ICS -\nsalbutamol), as -needed ICS -formoterol, and as -needed ICS -SABA.  \nSABA- containing relievers should not be used for regular \nmaintenance use, or to be taken when the person does not have \nasthma symptoms (except before exercise).  \nAnti-\ninflammatory reliever (AIR)  Reliever inhaler that contains both a low -dose \nICS and a rapid- acting \nbronchodilator  Includes budesonide- formoterol, beclometasone- formoterol and \nICS-salbutamol combinations. Patients can also use AIRs  as needed \nbefore exercise or allergen exposure to prevent asthma symptoms \nand bronchoconstriction. Non- formoterol LABAs in combination with \nICS cannot be used as relievers.

Almost all evidence for this is with \nICS-formoterol. Some ICS -formoterol combinations can be used as \nboth maintenance treatment and reliever treatment at Steps 3– 5 (see \nMART , below).

For example, if you switch treatment from a ‘medium’ dose of one \nICS to a ‘medium’ dose of another ICS, this may represent a decrease (or an increase) in potency, and the patient’s \nasthma may become unstable (or they may be at increased risk of adverse effects).  \nPatients should be monitored to ensure stability after any change of treatment  or inhaler device. Doses and potency \nmay also differ by country, depending on local products, inhaler devices, regulatory labelling and clinical guidelines \nor, for one product, with addition of a LAMA to an ICS -LABA.296 \nLow-dose ICS provides most of the clinical benefit of ICS for most patients with asthma.

        "text": "72 WHY SHOULD ICS -CONTAINING MEDICATION BE COMMENCED FROM THE TIME OF \nDIAGNOSIS?  \nFor the best outcomes, ICS -containing treatment should be initiated when (or as soon as possible after) the diagnosis \nof asthma is made. All patients should also be provided with a reliever inhaler for quick symptom relief, preferably an \nanti-inflammatory reliever (AIR).  \nGINA recommends ICS -containing medication from diagnosis for several  reasons:  \n• As-needed low -dose ICS -formoterol reduces the risk of severe exacerbations and emergency department visits or \nhospitalizations by 65% compared with SABA- only treatment.183 This anti -inflammatory reliever regimen (AIR -only) \nsignificantly reduces severe exacerbations regardless of the patient’s baseline symptom frequency, lung function, exacerbation history or inflammatory profile: type 2- high or Type 2- low.\n188 \n• Starting treatment with SABA alone trains patients to regard it as their main asthma treatment, and increases the risk of poor adherence when daily ICS is subsequently prescribed.  \n• Early initiation of low -dose ICS in patients with asthma leads to a greater improvement in lung function than if \nsymptoms have been present for more than 2 –4 years.\n297,298 One study showed that after this time, higher ICS \ndoses were required, and lower lung function was achieved.298 \n• Patients not taking ICS who experience a severe exacerbation have a greater long- term decline in lung function \nthan those who are taking ICS.117 \n• For patients with occupational asthma, early removal from exposure to the sensitizing agent and early ICS-containing treatment increase the probability of resolution of symptoms, and improvement of lung function and \nairway hyperresponsiveness.\n62,63 \nFor adults and adolescents, recommended options for initial asthma treatment, based on evidence (where available) \nand consensus, are listed in Box 4-4 (p.75) and shown in Box 4-5 (p.76). Treatment for adults and adolescents is \nshown in two tracks, depending on the reliever inhaler (Box 4-6 , p.77). \nFor children 6–11 years, recommendations about initial treatment are shown in Box 4- 10 (p. 94) and Box  4-11 (p.95).  \nThe patient’s response should be reviewed, and treatment stepped down once good control is achieved. \nRecommendations for a stepwise approach to ongoing treatment are found in Box 4-12 (p. 96). \nDoes FeNO help in deciding whether to commence ICS?  \nIn studies mainly limited to non- smoking adult patients, fractional concentration of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) >50 \nparts per billion (ppb) was associated with a good short -term (weeks) response to ICS.299,300 However, these studies \ndid not examine the longer -term risk of exacerbations, and the relationship between FeNO and other T ype 2 \nbiomarkers is lost in obese patients .24,48 In two 12- month studies in patients with mild asthma or taking SABA alone, \nsevere exacerbations were reduced with as -needed low -dose ICS -formoterol versus as -needed SABA and versus \nmaintenance ICS, independent of baseline inflammatory characteristics including FeNO.187,188 \nConsequently, in patients with a diagnosis or suspected diagnosis of asthma, high FeNO can support the decision to \nstart ICS, but low FeNO cannot be used to decide against treatment with ICS. Based on past and current evidence, \nGINA recommends treatment with daily low -dose ICS or as -needed low -dose ICS -formoterol for all adults and \nadolescents with mild asthma, to reduce the risk of serious exacerbations.6,187, 188,301,302 \nChoice of medication, device and dose  \nIn clinical practice, the choice of medication, device and dose for maintenance and for reliever for each individual patient should be based on assessment of symptom control, risk factors, which inhalers are available for the relevant medication class, which of these the patient can use correctly after training, their cost, their environmental impact and \nthe patient’s likely adherence. For more detail about choice of inhaler, see Section 5 (p. 108) and Box 5-1 (p.109). It is \nimportant to monitor the response to treatment and any side- effects, and to adjust the dose accordingly (Box 4-6 , \np.77). There is currently insufficient good- quality evidence to support use of extrafine- particle ICS aerosols over \nothers.\n303 \nCOPYRIGHTED MATERIAL - DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE"

        "text": "73 Once good symptom control has been maintained for 2– 3 months, and if the patient has not had any exacerbations, \nasthma treatment can be carefully down- titrated to the minimum medications and dose that will maintain good \nsymptom control and minimize exacerbation risk, while reducing the potential for side- effects (Box 4-6 , p.77). For \npatients with severe asthma who have had a good asthma response to biologic therapy, a longer period of stability is \nrecommended before the ICS dose is reduced, and reduction and cessation of OCS should be undertaken first. More \ndetails are given in Section 8, p. 139. Patients who are being considered for a high daily dose of ICS (except for short \nperiods) should be referred for expert assessment and advice, where possible (Section 8, p. 139).  \nGINA recommends that all adults and adolescents and all children 6– 11 years should receive ICS- containing \nmedication, incorporated in their maintenance and/or anti -inflammatory reliever treatment as part of personalized \nasthma management. For adults and adolescents, treatment options are shown in Box 4-6 (p.77) and, for children \naged 6– 11 years, in Box 4-12 (p. 96). Clinicians should check local eligibility and payer criteria before prescribing.  \nAdjusting ongoing asthma treatment in adults, adolescents , and children aged 6–11 years  \nOnce asthma treatment has begun (Box 4-4, Box 4- 5, Box 4 -10 and Box 4-11, p.75), ongoing treatment decisions are \nbased on a personalized cycle of assessment, adjustment of treatment, and review of the response. For each patient, \nin addition to treatment of modifiable risk factors, asthma medication can be adjusted up or down in a stepwise \napproach (adults and adolescents: Box 4-6 , p.77, children 6– 11 years, Box 4- 12, p.96) to achieve good symptom \ncontrol and minimize future risk of exacerbations, persistent airflow limitation and medication side- effects. When  good \nasthma control has been maintained for 2 –3 months, treatment may be stepped down to find the patient’s minimum \neffective treatment (Box 4- 13, p.102).  \nPeople’s ethnic and racial backgrounds may be associated with different responses to treatment. These are not necessarily associated with genetic differences.\n304 The contributors are likely to be multifactorial, including differences \nin exposures, social disadvantage, diet and health- seeking behavior.  \nIf a patient has persisting uncontrolled symptoms and/or exacerbations despite 2 –3 mont hs of ICS -containing \ntreatment, assess and correct the following common problems before considering any step up in treatment:  \n•Incorrect inhaler technique\n•Poor adherence\n•Persistent exposure at home/work to agents such as allergens, tobacco smoke, indoor or outdoor air pollution, orto medications such as beta- blockers or (in some patients) nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)\n•Comorbidities that may contribute to respiratory symptoms and poor quality of life\n•Incorrect diagnosis.\nThe evidence supporting treatment options at each step is summarized below, first for adults and adolescents, then for children 6 –11 years.  \nCOPYRIGHTED MATERIAL - DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE"

Treatment \nrecommendations for adults and adolescents are shown in two treatment Tracks (Box 4-3 ), for clarity. Suggested low, \nmedium and high doses for a range of ICS formulations are shown in Box 4-2 (p.71). Medication options and doses for \nGINA Track 1 are listed in Box 4-8 (p.84). Details about treatment steps for children 6 –11 years start on p. 94. \nBox 4-3 . Asthma treatment tracks for adults and adolescents  \nAsthma treatment  for adults and adolescents is in two Tracks  \nFor adults and adolescents, the main treatment figure (Box 4- 6, p.77), shows the options for ongoing treatment as \ntwo treatment ‘tracks’. The key difference is the medication that is used for symptom relief. In Track 1 (preferred), \nthe reliever is as needed low -dose ICS formoterol, and in Track 2, as -needed SABA or as -needed ICS -SABA.  \nThe reasons for showing treatment in two tracks are:  \n•to show clinicians how treatment can be stepped up and down using the same reliever at each step\n•because ICS -formoterol cannot be used as the reliever in patients prescribed a combination ICS with\nnon-formoterol LABA, due to lack of evidence about efficacy and safety (p. 69).14\nTrack 1: The reliever is as -needed low -dose ICS -formoterol  \nThis is the preferred approach recommended by GINA for adults and adolescents, because using low -dose ICS \nformoterol (an anti -inflammatory reliever; AIR) reduces the risk of severe exacerbations compared with regimens \nthat use SABA as reliever, with similar symptom control. In addition, the treatment regimen is simpler, with patients \nusing a single medication for reliever and for maintenance treatment if prescribed, across treatment steps.  \n•With this approach, when a patient at any treatment step has asthma symptoms, they use low -dose ICS -\nformoterol in a single inhaler for symptom relief. In Steps 1– 2, this provides their anti -inflammatory therapy.\n•In Steps 3 –5, patients also take ICS formoterol as their daily maintenance treatment; together, this is called\n‘maintenance- and-reliever therapy’ (MART).\n•Medications and doses for GINA Track 1 are shown in Box 4- 8 (p.84).\nTrack 2: The reliever is as -needed SABA or as- needed ICS -SABA  \nThis is an alternative approach if Track 1 is not possible, or if a patient’s asthma is stable with good adherence and no exacerbations on their current therapy. However, before prescribing a regimen with SABA reliever, consider whether the patient is likely to be adherent with their maintenance therapy, as otherwise they will be at higher risk of exacerbations.  \n•In Step 1, the patient takes a SABA and a low -dose ICS together for symptom relief when symptoms occur (in a\ncombination inhaler, or with the ICS taken immediately after the SABA).\n•In Steps 2 –5, a SABA (alone) or combination ICS- SABA is used for symptom relief, and the patient takes\nmaintenance ICS- containing medication regularly every day. If the reliever and maintenance medication are in\ndifferent devices, make sure that the patient can use each inhaler correctly.\n•If changing between steps requires a different inhaler device, train the patient how to use the new inhaler .\nStepping up and down \nTreatment can be stepped up or down along one track, using the same reliever at each step, or it can be switched \nbetween tracks, according to the individual patient’s needs and preferences. Before stepping up, check for common problems such as incorrect inhaler technique, poor adherence, and environmental exposures, and confirm that the \nsymptoms are due to asthma (Box 2- 4, p.47). \nAdditional controller options  \nThe additional controller options, shown below the two treatment tracks, have either limited indications or less \nevidence for their safety and/or efficacy, compared with the treatments in Tracks 1 and 2.  \nSee list of abbreviations (p. 11). \nCOPYRIGHTED MATERIAL - DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE"

These differences did not increase over \nthe 12- month studies. The primary outcome variable of one study301 was ‘well -controlled asthma weeks’, but this \noutcome was not considered reliable because it was based on an older concept of asthma control, and was \nsystematically biased against the as -needed ICS -formoterol treatment group because much less ICS was permitted in \na week for patients on ICS- formoterol than those on maintenance ICS before the week was classified as not well \ncontrolled.  \n• T he similar reduction in FeNO with as -needed budesonide- formoterol as with maintenance ICS, and the lack of \nsignificant difference in treatment effect with as -needed budesonide- formoterol by patients’ baseline eosinophils or \nbaseline FeNO.187,188 \nConsiderations  for the GINA recommend ation against SABA -only treatment of asthma  \nThere were several important considerations for extending the recommendation for as -needed- only low -dose ICS -\nformoterol to adults and adolescents with infrequent asthma symptoms (i.e., eliminating SABA -only treatment):6 \n• Patients with few interval asthma symptoms can still have severe or fatal exacerbations.180 GINA recommends \nassessing and addressing risk factors for exacerbations as well as symptom control (Box  2-2, p.37). \n• T\nhe historic distinction between so- called ‘intermittent’ and ‘mild persistent’ asthma is arbitrary, with no evidence of \ndifference in response to ICS.182 A large reduction in risk of severe exacerbations with as -needed ICS -formoterol, \ncompared with as -needed SABA, was seen even in patients with SABA use twice a week or less at baseline.187 \n• A post hoc analysis of one study found that a single day with increased as -needed budesonide- formoterol reduced the \nshort -term (21- day) risk of severe exacerbations compared to as needed SABA alone, suggesting that timing of use of \nICS-formoterol is important.128 \n• In patients with infrequent symptoms, adherence with prescribed daily ICS is very poor,309 exposing them to risks of \nSABA- only treatment if they are prescribed daily ICS plus as -needed SABA.  \n• T here is a lack of evidence for the safety or efficacy of SABA -only treatment. Historic recommendations for SABA -only \ntreatment were based on the assumption that patients with mild asthma would not benefit from ICS.182 \n• Taking SABA regularly for as little as one week significantly increases exercise- induced bronchoconstriction, airway \nhyperresponsiveness and airway inflammation, and decreases bronchodilator response.310,311 \n• Even modest over -use of SABA (indicated by dispensing of 3 or more 200- dose canisters a year) is associated with \nincreased risk of severe exacerbations86 and, in one study, asthma mortality.87 \n• GINA places a high priority on avoiding patients becoming reliant on SABA, and on avoiding conflicting messages in \nasthma education. Previously, patients were initially provided only with SABA for symptom relief, but later, despite this treatment being effective from the patient’s perspective, they were told that to reduce their SABA use, they needed to \ntake a daily maintenance treatment, even when they had no symptoms. Recommending that all patients should be \nprovided with ICS -containing treatment (including, in mild asthma, the option of as -needed ICS -formoterol)  from the \nstart of therapy  allows consistent messaging about the need for both symptom relief and risk reduction, and may avoid \nestablishing patient reliance on SABA as their main asthma treatment.  \nConsiderations for starting treatment with l ow-dose maintenance- and-reliever  therapy (Step 3 MART) instead of \nas-needed -only ICS -formoterol  (Steps 1 –2) \nThere is no specific evidence to guide this decision, but by consensus, we suggest starting with Step 3 MART (if permitted by local regulators) if the patient has symptoms most days or is waking at night due to asthma more than once a week (to rapidly reduce symptom burden), or if they are currently smoking, have impaired perception of bronchoconstriction (e.g. \nlow initial lung function but few symptoms), a recent severe exacerbation or a history of a life- threatening asthma \nexacerbation, have severe airway hyperresponsiveness, or are currently exposed to a seasonal allergic trigger.  \nCOPYRIGHTED MATERIAL - DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE"

The maximum recommended dose of as -needed budesonide-\nformoterol in a single day corresponds to a total of 72 mcg formoterol (54  mcg delivered dose). However, in randomized \ncontrolled trials ( RCTs ) in mild asthma, such high usage was rarely seen, with average use around 3 –4 doses per \nweek.187,301,302 For more details about medications and doses for as -needed- only ICS- formoterol, see Box 4-8 (p.84). \nRinsing the mouth is not generally needed after as -needed doses of low -dose ICS -formoterol, as this was not required in \nany of the mild asthma studies (or in MART studies), and there was no increase in risk of oral candidiasis .306 \nOther ICS -formoterol formulations  have not been studied for as -needed- only use, but beclometasone- formoterol may \nalso be suitable, as it is well-established for as -needed use within maintenance- and-reliever  therapy in GINA Steps 3–5.224 \nCombinations of ICS with non- formoterol LABA cannot be used as -needed for symptom relief.  \nFor p re -exercise use in patients with mild asthma, one 6- week study showed that use of low -dose budesonide- formoterol \nfor symptom relief and before exercise reduced exercise- induced bronchoconstriction to a similar extent as regular daily \nlow-dose ICS with SABA for symptom relief and before exercise.236 This suggests that patients with mild asthma who are \nprescribed as -needed low -dose ICS -formoterol to prevent exacerbations and control symptoms can use the same \nmedication before  exercis ing, if needed, and do not need to be prescribed a SABA for pre- exercise use (Evidence B). \nPatient preferences:  f rom qualitative research, the majority of patients in a pragmatic open- label study preferred as -\nneeded ICS -formoterol for ongoing treatment rather than regular daily ICS with a SABA reliever. They reported that shared \ndecision -making would be important in choosing between these treatment options.312 \nAsthma action plan: Simple action plans for AIR -only and MART are available online.313,314 \nTrack 1 (preferred) Step 3 treatment for adults and adolescents: low -dose ICS -formoterol \nmaintenance- and-reliever therapy (MART)  \nFor adults and adolescents, the preferred Step 3 option is low -dose ICS -formoterol as both maintenance and reliever  \ntreatment  (MART). In this regimen, low -dose ICS -formoterol, either budesonide- formoterol or beclometasone- formoterol, is \nused as both the daily maintenance treatment and as an anti -inflammatory reliever for symptom relief. The low -dose \nICS-formoterol can also be used before exercise, and before expected allergen exposure.  \nBefore considering a step up, check for common problems such as incorrect inhaler technique, poor adherence, and \nenvironmental exposures, and confirm that the symptoms are due to asthma (Box 2- 4, p.47). \nPopulations studied  \nDouble- blind studies included adult and adolescent patients with ≥1 exacerbation in the previous year despite \nmaintenance low-dose ICS or ICS -LABA treatment, with poor symptom control. Open- label studies were in patients taking \nat least low -dose ICS or ICS -LABA, with suboptimal asthma control; they did not require a history of  exacerbations .226 \nEvidence  \nLow-dose ICS -formoterol maintenance- and-reliever  therapy reduced severe exacerbations and provided similar levels of \nasthma control at relatively low doses of ICS, compared with a fixed dose of ICS -LABA as maintenance treatment or a \nhigher dose of ICS, both with as -needed SABA (Evidence A).226,315-319 In a meta- analysis, switching patients with \nuncontrolled asthma from Step 3 treatment plus SABA reliever to MART was associated with a 29% reduced risk of severe exacerbation, compared with stepping up to Step 4 ICS -LABA maintenance plus SABA reliever, and a 30% reduced risk \ncompared with staying on the same treatment with SABA reliever.\n320 In open- label studies that did not require a history of \nCOPYRIGHTED MATERIAL - DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE"

As for patients using as -\nneeded- only ICS- formoterol (p. 79), this reduces the risk of progressing to a severe exacerbation in the next 3 weeks.126-128  \nOther considerations  \nUse of ICS -formoterol as an anti -inflammatory reliever across treatment steps provides a simple regimen with easy \ntransition if treatment needs to be stepped up (e.g. , from Step 1–2 to Step 3, or Step 3 to Step 4), without the need for an \nadditional medication or different prescription, or a different inhaler type (see Box  4-8, p.84). \nPractice points for maintenance -and-reliever  therapy (MART) with low -dose ICS -formoterol  \nMedications : ICS-formoterol maintenance- and-reliever  therapy for Step 3 treatment can be prescribed with low -dose \nbudesonide- formoterol (≥12 years) or low -dose beclometasone- formoterol (≥18 years). The usual dose for MART with \nbudesonide- formoterol is 200/6 mcg metered dose (160/4.5 mcg delivered dose) and the usual dose for MART with \nbeclometasone- formoterol is 100/6 metered dose (delivered dose 84.6/5 mcg for pMDI and 81.9/5  mcg for DPI ). Each of \nthese combinations is prescribed as one inhalation twice- daily plus  one inhalation whenever needed for symptom relief.  \nDoses: For MART with budesonide- formoterol, the maximum recommended total dose of formoterol in a single day (total \nof maintenance- and-reliever  doses ) gives 72 mcg metered dose (54 mcg delivered dose)  of formoterol, with extensive \nevidence from large studies for its safety and efficacy up to this dose in a single day ,224,226 with or without ICS .306,322,323 \nBased on this evidence, GINA suggests that the same maximum total dose of formoterol in a single day should also apply \nfor MART with beclometasone- formoterol  (maximum total 12 inhalations, total metered dose 72 mcg) . Most patients need \nfar fewer doses than this. For a summary of medications and doses, see Box 4-8 (p.84).  \nICS-formoterol should not be used as the reliever for patients taking a different ICS -LABA maintenance treatment, since \nclinical evidence for safety and efficacy is lacking.  Use of ICS -formoterol with other LABAs may be associated with \nincreased adverse effects.14 \nRinsing the mouth is not generally needed after as -needed doses of ICS -formoterol, as this was not required in any of \nthe MART studies, and there was no increase in risk of oral candidiasis . \nAdditional practice points can be found in an article describing how to use MART, including a customizable written asthma action plan for use with this regimen.\n313 Other action plans for MART are available online.313,314  \nTrack 1 (preferred) Step 4 treatment for adults and adolescents: medium -dose ICS -formoterol \nmaintenance- and-reliever therapy (MART)  \nAt a population level , most benefit from ICS is obtained at low dose, but individual ICS responsiveness varies, and some \npatients whose asthma is uncontrolled on low -dose ICS -LABA despite good adherence and correct inhaler technique may \nbenefit from increasing the maintenance dose to medium, usually by taking twice the number of inhalations (see Box  4-8, \np.84). High -dose ICS -formoterol  is not recommended in Track 1 Step 4.  \nBefore stepping up, check for common problems such as incorrect inhaler technique, poor adherence, and environmental exposures, and confirm that the symptoms are due to asthma (Box 2- 4, p.47). \nPatients prescribed MART use low -dose ICS -formoterol as needed for symptom relief, and before exercise or allergen \nexposure if needed.  \nFor adult and adolescent patients, combination ICS -formoterol as both maintenance -and-reliever  treatment (MART) is \nmore effective in reducing exacerbations than the same dose of maintenance ICS -LABA or higher doses of ICS\n318 or ICS -\nLABA224 (Evidence A). The greatest reduction in risk was seen in patients with a history of severe exacerbations,224 but \nMART was also significantly more effective than conventional best practice with as -needed SABA in open- label studies in \nwhich patients were not selected for greater exacerbation risk.226 \nCOPYRIGHTED MATERIAL - DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE"

        "text": "84 Box 4-8 . Medications and doses for GINA Track 1: anti -inflammatory reliever (AIR) therapy  \nGINA Track 1 – general principles  \nIn GINA Track 1, the reliever inhaler is low -dose ICS -formoterol , with or without maintenance ICS- formoterol. This \nis the preferred treatment approach for adults and adolescents with asthma, because it reduces severe exacerbations \nacross treatment steps compared with using a SABA reliever; it uses a single medication for both reliever and maintenance treatment (less confusing for patients); and the  patient’s treatment can be stepped up and down if needed \nwithout changing the medication or inhaler device. This cannot be done with any other ICS -LABA.  ICS-formoterol can \nalso be used before exercise and before allergen exposure.  \nLow-dose ICS -formoterol\n  is called an anti -inflammatory reliever (AIR)  because it relieves symptoms and reduces \ninflammation. AIR with ICS- formoterol significantly reduces the risk of severe exacerbations across treatment steps \ncompared with using a SABA reliever, with similar symptom control, lung function and adverse effects.  \nSteps 1 –2 (AIR -onl y): low -dose ICS -formoterol is used as needed for symptom relief without any maintenance \ntreatment. It reduces the risk of severe exacerbations and ED visits/hospitalizations by 65% compared with SABA alone, and reduces ED visits/hospitalizations by 37% , compared with daily ICS plus as -needed SABA.\n183 Starting \ntreatment with as -needed ICS -formoterol avoids training patients to regard SABA as their main asthma treatment.  \nSteps 3 –5 (MART) : main t enance- and-reliever therapy with ICS- formoterol reduces the risk of severe exacerbations by \n32% compared with the same dose of ICS -LABA,224 by 23% compared with a higher dose of ICS- LABA,224 and by 17% \ncompared with usual care.226 MART is also an option for children 6– 11 years in Steps 3– 4. \nAsthma action plan: Simple action plans for AIR -only and MART are available online.313,314 \nWhich medications can be used in GINA Track 1, and how often?  \nMost evidence for MART, and all evidence for AIR -only, is with budesonide- formoterol DPI, usually 200/6 mcg metered \ndose (160/4.5 mcg delivered dose) for adults/adolescents, and 100/6 mcg (80/4.5  mcg delivered dose) for MART in \nchildren 6 –11 years. Beclometasone dipropionate (BDP) -formoterol 100/6 mcg (84.6/5.0) is also effective for MART in \nadults. Other low -dose combination ICS -formoterol products may be suitable but have not been studied.  \nFor as -needed use, p at ients should take either 1 or 2 inhalations (based on the formulation; see below and next page)  \nwhenever needed for symptom relief, or before exercise or allergen exposure, instead of a SABA reliever.  \nPatients do not need to wait a certain number of hours before taking more reliever doses (unlike SABA), but in a single \nday, they  s\nhould not take more than the maximum total number of inhalations shown below and over ( total as -needed \nplus maintenance doses, if used). Most patients need far less than this.  \nAge Inhalers: mcg/inhalation metered dose \n[delivered dose] and maximum in any day Dosing frequency by age group and treatment step \n(see next page for additional inhaler options and doses)  \n6–11 \nyears  Budesonide-f ormoterol 100/6 DPI [80/4.5]  \n(maximum total 8 inhalations i n any day ) Step 1– 2 AIR -only: no evidence to date \nStep 3 MART: 1 inhalation once daily plus 1 as needed \nStep 4 MART: 1 inhalation twice daily plus 1 as needed  \nStep 5 MART: not recommended \n12–17 \nyears  Budesonide-fo rmoterol 200/6 [160/4.5] mcg \nDPI or pMDI\n(maximum total 12 inhalations in any  day) Step 1– 2 (AIR -only): 1 inhalation as needed  \nStep 3 MART: 1 inhalation twice (or once) daily plus 1 as needed \nStep 4 MART: 2 inhalations twice daily plus 1 as needed  \nStep 5 MART: 2 inhalations twice daily plus 1 as needed  \n≥18 \nyears  Budesonide-formoterol 200/6 [160/4.5] or\nBDP-formoterol 100/6 mcg, pMDI or DPI \n(maximum total 12 inhalations in any day†) Step 1– 2 (AIR -only): 1 inhalation as needed†  \nStep 3 MART: 1 inhalation twice (or once) daily plus 1 as needed Step 4 MART: 2 inhalations twice daily plus 1 as needed  \nStep 5 MART: 2 inhalations twice daily plus 1 as needed  \n†For beclometasone (BDP)-fo rmoterol, GINA suggests that the maximum total dose in any day should be 12 inhalations, based on  \nextensive safety data with budesonide-fo rmoterol ; it has not been studied as-ne eded only but may be suitable (see p.82.

        "text": "87 Other considerations  \nIn making this recommendation, the most important considerations were reducing the risk of severe exacerbations, and \nthe difficulty of achieving good adherence with regularly prescribed ICS in patients with infrequent symptoms. For definitions of low -dose ICS see Box 4-2 (p.71). \nPatients with symptoms less than 1– 2 days a week are extremely unlikely to take ICS regularly even if prescribed, leaving \nthem exposed to the risks of SABA- only treatment, so taking ICS whenever SABA is taken is likely  to be a better option in \nsuch p atients.  \nPractice points  \nIf combination ICS -SABA is not available, the patient needs to carry both ICS and SABA inhalers with them for as -needed \nuse. See Box 4-2 (p.71) for ICS doses. There are no studies with daily maintenance low -dose ICS plus as -needed \ncombination ICS -SABA.  \nMedications not recommended for adults and adolescents with asthma  \nSABA- only treatment is not recommended  by GINA for adults, adolescents or children 6– 11 years  with asthma. \nAlthough inhaled SABAs are highly effective for the quick relief of asthma symptoms,328 patients whose asthma is treated \nwith SABA alone (compared with ICS) are at increased risk of asthma- related death (Evidence A)87,329 and of urgent \nasthma- related healthcare (Evidence A),330 even if they have good symptom control.331 The risk of severe exacerbations \nrequiring urgent health care is substantially reduced in adults and adolescents by either as -needed ICS -formoterol,183 or \nby regular low -dose ICS with as -needed SABA.307 The risk of asthma exacerbations and mortality increases incrementally \nwith higher SABA use, including in patients treated with SABA alone.87 One long- term study of regular SABA in patients \nwith newly diagnosed asthma showed worse outcomes and lower lung function than in patients who were treated with daily low -dose ICS from the start.\n332 Starting treatment of asthma with SABA alone encourages patients to regard it as \ntheir main (and often only) asthma treatment, leading to poor adherence if ICS -containing therapy is prescribed.  \nTreatment with oral bronchodilators (e.g. salbutamol tablets or syrups ; o ral theophylline) is not recommended  for \ntreatment of asthma in any age group. F or additional  non-recommended bronchodilators, see p. 93. \nTrack 2 (alternative) Step 2 treatment options for adults and adolescents: low -dose maintenance ICS \nplus as -needed SABA \nRegular daily low -dose ICS with as -needed SABA was standard of care for mild asthma for the past 30 years. Most \nguidelines recommended its use only for patients with asthma symptoms more than twice a week, based on an \nassumption that patients with less frequent symptoms did not need, and would not benefit, from ICS.182 \nPopulation studied \nMost studies of daily low -dose ICS have included patients with symptoms between 3–7 days a week . \nEvidence  \nRegular daily low -dose ICS plus as -needed SABA is a long- established treatment for mild asthma. There is a large body \nof evidence from RCTs and observational studies showing that the risks of severe exacerbations, hospitalizations and \nmortality are substantially reduced with regular low -dose ICS; symptoms and exercise- induced bronchoconstriction are \nalso reduced (Evidence A).307,329,333-335 Severe exacerbations are halved with low -dose ICS even in patients with \nsymptoms 0 –1 days a week.182 In a meta- analysis of long- term cohort studies, regular ICS was associated with a very \nsmall increase in pre- bronchodilator FEV 1% predicted, but there is insufficient evidence that it protects from development \nof persistent airflow limitation.336 \nOther considerations  \nClinicians should be aware that adherence with maintenance ICS in the community is extremely low.

For patients taking maintenance ICS, changing to maintenance combination ICS -\nLABA provides additional improvements in symptoms and lung function with a reduced risk of exacerbations compared with the same dose of ICS (Evidence A),\n339,340 but there is only a small reduction in reliever use.341,342 In these studies, the \nreliever was as -needed SABA.

For example, a registry study found that over 80% of patients with severe asthma would have been excluded from major regulatory studies evaluating biologic therapy.\n369 \nRecommendations from the GINA Short Guide and decision tree on Diagnosis and Management of difficult -to-treat and \nsevere asthma in adolescent and adult patients are included in Section 8 (p.139). These recommendations emphasize the \nimportance of first optimizing existing therapy and treating modifiable risk factors and comorbidities (see Box 8-2, p.142).

There is little \nevidence about initiating MART in patients receiving add- on treatment such as LAMA or biologic therapy.15 However, in \none study,15 patients with severe eosinophilic asthma that was well  controlled on benralizumab and high- dose ICS -LABA \nwere randomized to budesonide- formoterol, either as high dose maintenance plus as -needed SABA, or as medium- dose \nMART with subsequent 8- weekly options for down- titration. Asthma remained stable after the switch from high -dose ICS -\nformoterol to medium- dose MART, supporting the safety of MART in this population on Step 5 treatment. Most patients \nrandomized to MART were able to further reduce their ICS -formoterol dose, but there was an increase in FeNO and \ndecrease in FEV 1 in those who stepped down to as -needed- only ICS -formoterol,15 suggesting that maintenance doses of \nICS-formoterol should not be stopped. \nAdd- on long -acting muscarinic antagonists  \nAdd-on long- acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA) can be prescribed in a separate inhaler (tiotropium), or in a \ncombination (‘triple’) inhaler for patients aged ≥18 years (beclometasone- formoterol -glycopyrronium; fluticasone furoate-\nvilanterol- umeclidinium; mometasone- indacaterol -glycopyrronium) if asthma is not well controlled with medium or high-\ndose ICS -LABA.

Results for children 6–\n11 years have not been published separately.  \nEvidence  \nB\noth studies used separate albuterol and beclometasone dipropionate (BDP) 50 mcg [40 mcg delivered dose] inhalers for \nthe intervention, 2 puffs of BDP for each 2 puffs of albuterol  (with the inhalers taped together, back -to-back, in the TREXA \nstudy . In the TREXA study, the comparators were as -needed SABA and as -needed ICS+SABA, each with or without \nregular ICS. The highest rate of exacerbations was among the children receiving SABA alone, and there was a significant \nreduction in treatment failures in the group that took ICS whenever SABA was taken, as well as in the other ICS -\ncontaining groups.325 In the ASIST study, symptom- based adjustment of ICS dose was associated with similar outcomes \nas with physician- adjusted treatment , with lower average ICS dose (Evidence B).327 Exacerbations and symptoms were \nsimilar with this regimen as with maintenance ICS plus as -needed SABA.  \nOther considerations  \nN\neither of these studies was sufficiently powered to examine severe exacerbations as an outcome. In the TREXA study, \nthere were no differences in asthma symptom control or airway hyperresponsiveness between the treatment groups.

        "text": "100 REVIEWING RESPONSE AND ADJUSTING TREATMENT  – ADULTS, ADOLESCENTS AND \nCHILDREN 6 –11 YEARS \nHow often should asthma be reviewed?  \nEach p atient ’s asthma should be reviewed regularly to monitor symptom control, risk factors and occurrence of \nexacerbations, and to document response to any treatment changes. For most controller medications, improvement in \nsymptoms and lung function begins within days of initiating treatment, but the full benefit may only be reached after 3– 4 \nmonths ,415 or even later in patients with severe and chronically under -treated asthma.416 \nAll healthcare providers should be encouraged to assess asthma control, adherence and inhaler technique at every visit, \nnot just when the patient presents because of their asthma.417 The frequency of visits depends upon the patient’s initial \nlevel of control, their response to treatment, and their level of engagement in self -management.  \nIdeally, patients should be seen 1– 3 mo nths after starting treatment and every 3– 12 months thereafter. After an \nexacerbation, a review visit within 1 week should be scheduled (Evidence D).418 \nStepping up asthma treatment  \nAsthma is a variable condition, and adjustments of controller treatment by the clinician and/or the patient may be \nneeded.419 \nDay-to-day adjustment using an anti- inflammatory reliever (AIR)  \nFor patients whose reliever inhaler is combination budesonide- formoterol or beclometasone- formoterol (with or without \nmaintenance ICS- formoterol), the patient adjusts the number of as needed doses of ICS -formoterol from day to day \naccording to their symptoms. This strategy reduces the risk of developing a severe exacerbation requiring OCS within the \nnext 3– 4 weeks.126-128 As-needed combination budesonide- salbutamol is an anti -inflammatory reliever option that has \nbeen studied in Steps 3– 5.343 \nShort -term step- up (for 1 –2 weeks)  \nA short -term increase in maintenance ICS dose for 1 –2 weeks may be necessary  (e.g., during viral infections or seasonal \nallergen exposure) . This increase may be initiated by the patient according to their written asthma action plan \n(Box 9-2, p.162), or by the healthcare provider.  \nSustained step- up (for at least 2– 3 months)  \nAlthough at a group level most benefit from ICS is obtained at low dose, individual ICS responsiveness varies ; some \npatients whose asthma is uncontrolled on low -dose ICS -LABA despite good adherence and correct technique may benefit \nfrom increasing the maintenance dose to medium. A step- up in treatment may be recommended (Box 4-6, p.77) after \nconfirming  that the symptoms are due to asthma, inhaler technique and adherence are satisfactory, and modifiable risk \nfactors such as smoking have been addressed (Box 3-5 , p.55). Any step -up should be regarded as a therapeutic trial ; if \nthere is no response after 2 –3 months, treatment should be reduced to the previous level, and alternative treatments or \nreferral considered.  \nStepping down treatment when asthma is well controlled  \nOnce good asthma control has been achieved and maintained for 2 –3 months and lung function has reached a plateau, \ntreatment can often be successfully reduced, without loss of asthma control. The aims of stepping down are:  \n•To find the patient’s minimum effective treatment, i.e., to maintain good control of symptoms and exacerbations, and to\nminimize the costs of treatment and potential for side- effects\n•To encourage the patient to continue ICS-containing treatment. Patients prescribed maintenance controller treatment\nin either Track often experiment with intermittent treatment through concern about the risks or costs of daily\ntreatment .420 For patients  prescribed GINA Track 1 MART, the ICS -formoterol reliever provides a safety net during\nplanned step- down or if adherence with maintenance doses is poor.

Step-down options for patients on different treatment steps are shown in Box 4-13 (p. 102).  \nBefore stepping down  \nThe approach to stepping down will differ from patient to patient depending on their current treatment, risk factors and \npreferences. There are few data on the optimal timing, sequence and magnitude of treatment reductions in asthma. \nFactors associated with a greater risk of exacerbation after step- down include a history of exacerbations and/or \nemergency department visit for asthma in the previous 12 months,421,422 and a low baseline FEV 1.422 Other predictors of \nloss of control during dose reduction include airway hyperresponsiveness and sputum eosinophilia,423 but these tests are \nnot readily available in primary care.  \nAny treatment step- down  should be considered as a therapeutic trial, evaluating the response in terms of both symptom \ncontrol and exacerbation frequency. Before stepping down, the patient should be given a written asthma action plan and \ninstructions for how and when to re -start their previous treatment if their symptoms worsen.  \nHow to step asthma treatment down  \nDecisions about treatment step- down should be based on individual assessment . In one study of patients with well -\ncontrolled asthma on medium- dose ICS -LABA, reducing the ICS dose and removing the LABA had similar effects on a \ncomposite treatment failure outcome. However, stopping LABA was associated with lower lung function and more hospitalizations , and decreasing the ICS dose was inferior to maintaining a stable dose of ICS -LABA.\n424 \nIf treatment is stepped down too far or too quickly, the risk of exacerbations may increase even if symptoms remain \nreasonably controlled (Evidence B).425 Higher baseline FeNO has not been demonstrated to predict exacerbations \nfollowing step- down of ICS dose.426,427 A meta- analysis suggested that greater reduction in ICS dose may be able to be \nachieved in patients with baseline FeNO <50 ppb, but the findings point to the need for further research.427 Complete \ncessation of ICS is associated with a significantly increased risk of exacerbations (Evidence A).428 \nStepping down from daily low -dose ICS plus as -needed SABA to as needed- only ICS- formoterol provides similar or \ngreater protection from severe exacerbations and need for urgent health care, with similar symptom control and lung \nfunction and a much lower average daily ICS dose, compared with treatment with daily low -dose ICS plus as -needed \nSABA.183 Step-down strategies for different controller treatments are summarized in Box 4- 13 (p.102); these are based on \ncurrent evidence, but more research is needed.

        "text": "103 Other strategies for adjusting asthma treatment  \nSome alternative strategies for adjusting asthma maintenance ICS -containing treatment have been evaluated:  \n•Treatment guided by sputum eosinophil count : in adults, this approach, when compared with guidelines -based\ntreatment, leads to a reduced risk of exacerbations and similar levels of symptom control and lung function in patients\nwith frequent exacerbations and moderate- severe asthma.390 However, few clinics have routine access to induced\nsputum analysis. There is insufficient evidence  to assess this approach in children .390 Sputum- guided treatment is\nrecommended for adult patients with moderate or severe asthma who are managed in (or can be referred to) centersexperienced in this technique (Evidence A).\n175,390\n•Treatment guided by fractional concentration of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO):  In several studies of FeNO -guided\ntreatment, problems with the design of the intervention and/or control algorithms make comparisons and conclusionsdifficult.\n434 Results of FeNO measurement at a single point in time should be interpreted with caution.50,299 The\nrelationship between FeNO and other T ype 2 biomarkers is lost or altered in obesity.24,48\nIn a 2016 meta- analysis, FeNO -guided treatment in children and young adults with asthma was associated with a\nsignificant reduction in the number of patients with ≥1 exacerbation (OR 0.67; 95% CI 0.51– 0.90) and in exacerbation\nrate (mean difference –0.27; 95% –0.49 to – 0.06 per year) compared with guidelines -based treatment (Evidence A);435\nFeNO -guided treatment was associated with similar benefits when compared with non-guidelines -based algorithms.435\nHowever, a subsequent good- quality multicenter clinical trial in children with asthma in secondary and primary care\ncenters found that the addition of FeNO to symptom- guided treatment did not reduce severe exacerbations over 12\nmonths.436\nIn non- smoking adults with asthma, no significant reduction in risk of exacerbations and in exacerbation rates was\nobserved with FeNO -guided treatment, compared with treatment strateg ies similar to those  in most guidelines; a\ndifference was seen only in studies with other (non- typical) comparator approaches to adjustment of treatment.437 In a\nlarge study in pregnant women, there was no reduction in exacerbations with FeNO -guided treatment compared with\nusual care.16 In adults and in children, no significant differences were seen in symptoms or ICS dose with FeNO -\nguided treatment compared with other strategies.435,437\n•Treatment guided by combination biomarkers : An RCT in patients taking high- dose ICS -LABA compared a treatment\nadjustment strategy based on a composite of T2 biomarkers only with an algorithm based on ACQ -7 and history of\nrecent exacerbation, but the findings were inconclusive because a substantial proportion of patients did not follow\nrecommendations for treatment change.438\n•Selection of add- on treatment for patients with severe asthma: The assessment of severe asthma includes\nidentification of the inflammatory phenotype, based on blood or sputum eosinophils or FeNO, to assess the patient’seligibility for various add- on treatments including biologic therapy. A higher baseline blood eosinophil count and/or\nFeNO predicts a good asthma response to some biologic therapies (see Box 8-3 , p.143 and Box 8-4 , p.144).\nFurther studies are needed to identify the subpopulations of patients with asthma who are most likely to benefit from biomarker -guided adjustment of maintenance ICS- containing treatment, and the optimal frequency of monitoring, including \nfor corticosteroid de- escalation strategies. Until more definitive evidence is available to support  a specific strategy, GINA \ncontinues to recommend a comprehensive clinical evaluation that includes patient -reported symptoms as well as \nmodifiable risk factors, environmental exposures comorbidities and patient preferences , when making treatment decisions  \nfor individual patients . \nCOPYRIGHTED MATERIAL - DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE"

A 2017 systematic review and meta- analysis , which included observational studies with a \nwide range of study designs , suggested that influenza vaccination reduced the risk of asthma exacerbations, but bias \ncould not be excluded for  most of the studies.457 There is no evidence for an increase in asthma exacerbations after \ninfluenza vaccination compared with  placebo.457 A systematic review of studies in individuals aged 2– 49 years with mild –\nmoderate asthma found no significant safety concerns or increased risk for asthma- related outcomes after influenza \nvaccination with live attenuated virus.458 \nRespiratory syncytial virus \nRespiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection causes lower respiratory tract disease in infants , including bronchiolitis and \npneumonia. It also causes lower respiratory tract infections in older children and adults, and may exacerbate asthma. Children and the elderly are more likely to experience severe disease with RSV infection. RSV vaccines prevent RSV -\nrelated acute respiratory infection; an adjuvanted RSV-subunit vaccine reduced upper and lower respiratory tract disease \nin adults 60 years or older, including in those with underlying coexisting conditions such as asthma.\n459,460\nOther vaccines  \nPeople with asthma, particularly children and the elderly, are at higher risk of pneumococcal disease.461 Pneumococcal \nvaccine protects against invasive pneumococcal infection, but asthma alone is not a specific indication for pneumococcal vaccination.\n462 Pertussis infection may trigger or mimic asthma exacerbations, and pertussis vaccination reduces the risk \nof severe pertussis -related disease, but there is limited evidence on the efficacy and safety of vaccines in preventing \nasthma exacerbations in adults  (and hence for an asthma- specific recommendation). For information about COVID -19 \nvaccines, see p. 122. \nAdvice  \n•Advise patients with moderate to severe asthma to receive an influenza vaccination every year, or at least whenvaccination of the general population is advised (Evidence C). Follow local immunization schedules.\n•Encourage children, adults and the elderly with asthma to follow their local immunization schedule, including  for\npneumococcal, pertussis, influenza, RSV and COVID -19 vaccinations. Advice about COVID -19 vaccination is on\np.122.\n•COVID -19 vaccination and influenza vaccination may be given on the same day.\nOTHER THERAPIES  \nBronchial thermoplasty \nBronchial thermoplasty is a potential treatment option at Step 5 in some countries for adult patients whose asthma remains uncontrolled despite optimized therapeutic regimens and referral to an asthma specialty center (Evidence B). \nBronchial thermoplasty involves treatment of the airways during three separate bronchoscopies with a localized \nradiofrequency pulse.\n150 The treatment is associated with a large placebo effect.150 In patients taking high- dose ICS -LABA, \nbronchial thermoplasty was associated with an increase in asthma exacerbations during the 3 month treatment period, and a subsequent decrease in exacerbations, but no beneficial effect on lung function or asthma symptoms compared with sham- controlled patients.\n150 Extended follow -up of some treated patients reported a sustained reduction in \nCOPYRIGHTED MATERIAL - DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE"

Guided asthma self -management education and skills training\nKEY POINTS  \nAs with other chronic diseases, people with asthma need education and skills training to manage it well. This is most \neffectively achieved through a partnership between the patient /carer  and their healthcare providers. The essential \ncomponents for this include:  \n•Choosing the most appropriate inhaler for the patient’s asthma treatment: consider available devices, cost, the ability\nof the patient to use the inhaler after training, environmental impact, and patient satisfaction\n•Skills training to use inhaler devices effectively\n•Encouraging adherence with medications, appointments and other advice, within an agreed management strategy\n•Asthma information\n•Training in guided self -management, with self -monitoring of symptoms or peak expiratory flow (PEF) , a written asthma\naction plan to show how to recognize and respond to worsening asthma, and regular review by a healthcare provider\nor trained healthcare worker.\nIn developing, customizing and evaluating self -management interventions for different cultures, sociocultural factors \nshould be considered.468 \nSKILLS TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE USE OF INHALER DEVICES  \nDelivery of respiratory medications by inhalation achieves a high concentration in the airways, more rapid onset of action, \nand fewer systemic adverse effects than systemic delivery. However, using an inhaler is a skill that must be learnt and maintained in order for the medication to be delivered effectively.  \nPoor inhaler technique leads to poor asthma control, increased risk of exacerbations and increased adverse effects.\n91 \nMost patients (up to 70–80%) do not use their inhaler correctly. Unfortunately, many healthcare providers are unable to correctly demonstrate how to use the inhalers they prescribe.\n469 Most people with incorrect technique are unaware that \nthey have a problem. There is no ‘perfect’ inhaler – patients can have problems using any inhaler device. The several \nfactors that should be considered in the choice of inhaler device for an individual patient are described below and in \nBox 5-1 (p.109).  \nSt\nrategies for ensuring effective use of inhaler devices are summarized in Box 5-2 ( p.110).470 These principles apply to all \ntypes of inhaler devices. For patients prescribed pressurized metered- dose inhalers (pMDIs), use of a spacer improves \ndelivery  of the medicine to the lungs.  For inhaled corticosteroids  (ICS) spacers also reduce the potential for local side-\neffects such as dysphonia and oral candidiasis.471 With ICS, the risk of candidiasis can also be reduced by rinsing and \nspitting out after use.  \nChecking and correcting inhaler technique using a standardized checklist takes only 2– 3 mi nutes and leads to improved \nasthma control in adults472,473 and older children470 (Evidence A). A physical demonstration is essential to improve inhaler \ntechnique.474 This is easiest if the healthcare provider has placebo inhalers and a spacer. After training, inhaler technique \ndeteriorates with time, so checking and re- training must be repeated regularly. This is particularly important for patients \nwith poor symptom control or a history of exacerbations. Attaching a pictogram475,476 or a list of inhaler technique steps477 \nto the inhaler substantially increases the retention of correct technique at follow -up. Pharmacists, nurses and trained lay \nhealth workers can provide highly effective inhaler skills training.470,478-480 \nCOPYRIGHTED MATERIAL - DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE"

Reducing the risk of severe exacerbations and asthma deaths is a global priority that is driving initiatives t o \nincrease access to ICS -containing inhalers for people with asthma worldwide (see p. 123) and, when these inhalers are \navailable, to ensure that patients /carers  are trained in how to use them correctly.  \nThere is also increasing interest in the potential to reduce the impact of asthma and its care (routine and urgent) on the environment, including from the manufacture and potential recycling of inhaler devices, and from the propellants in pMDIs, which are the inhalers most commonly used worldwide.\n481-483 \nFor all age- groups, selecting the right inhaler for the individual patient is crucial to asthma care, not only to reduce \npatients’ symptom burden, but also to reduce the need for emergency health care and hospitalization, which have even \ngreater environmental impacts than use of pMDIs.484,485 \nBox 5-1 .

Consider the preferred\nmedication (Box 4-6 , p.77 and Box 4-12, p.96), available devices, patient skills, environmental impact and\ncost (see Box  5-1, p.109).\n•If different options are available, encourage the patient to participate in the choice.\n•For pMDIs, use of a spacer improves delivery and (with ICS) reduces the potential for side- effects.\n•Ensure that there are no physical barriers, e.g. , arthritis, that limit use of the inhaler.\n•Avoid use of multiple different inhaler types where possible, to avoid confusion.\nCHECK \n•Check inhaler technique at every opportunity.\n•Ask the patient to show you how they use their inhaler (don’t just ask if they know how to use it).\n•Identify any errors using a device- specific checklist.\nCORRECT \n•Show the patient how to use the device correctly with a physical demonstration, e.g., using a placebo inhaler.\n•Check technique again, paying attention to problematic steps. You may need to repeat this process 2– 3\ntimes within the same session for the patient to master the correct technique.472\n•Consider an alternative device only if the patient cannot use the inhaler correctly after several repeats oftraining.\n•Re-check inhaler technique frequently.

The approach in GINA Track 1 (Box 4-3,  p. 74) is preferred, because the use of ICS-\nformoterol\n as an anti-i nflammatory reliever reduces the risk of s evere exacerbations and urgent healthcare utilization  \ncompared with usi\nng a short-a cting beta 2 agonist (SABA) reliever. The Track 1 approach also avoids the risks  \nassociated\n with SABA over-u se, and allows simple adjustment across treatment steps with a single medication for both \nsymptom relief and delivery of ICS-c ontaining treatment. Most studies  of maintenance-a nd -reliever therapy\n(MART) with ICS-f ormoterol, and all studies of as-n eeded-o nly ICS-f ormoterol have used a DPI.\n•Which inhaler devices are available to the patient for these medications? The choice of device for any particular  \nmedication class in each c ountry is often limited. Consider local availability, ac cess, and cost to the patient.  Where  \nmore than one medication is needed, a single (combination) inhaler is preferable to multiple inhalers. Also consider the \npatient’s age, since DPIs are not suitable for most children aged ≤5 years and some elderly patients; pMDIs  with \nspacers\n remain essential for such patients.\n•Can the patient use the available device(s) correctly after training? This may be determined by  factors including  \nphysical\n dexterity, coordination, inspiratory flow, and cognitive status.

Incorrect inhaler technique \nincreases risk of severe asthma exacerbations.  \n•What are the environmental implications of the available inhaler(s)? This has become an important part of inhaler\nselection, with particular  consideration of  carbon emissions due to the propellants in pMDIs , but also of environmental\neffects of  inhaler manufacture and potential recycling. However, clinicians need to be aware of the potential to place\nthe additional burden of ‘green guilt’ on patients , as this  could reduce adherence and increase the risk of\nexacerbations.\n•Is the patient satisfied with the medication and inhaler? The best inhaler for each patient is likely to be the one thatthey prefer and can use correctly , as this promotes adherence and reduces risk of exacerbations and adverse effects.\nIn follow -up, review symptom control, asthma exacerbations and adverse events, and check the patient’s ability to use \ntheir inhaler(s) correctly, ideally at each visit.  \nADHERENCE WITH MEDICATION AND WITH OTHER ADVICE  \nIdentifying poor adherence \nPoor adherence is defined as the failure of treatment to be taken as agreed upon by the patient and the healthcare \nprovider. There is increasing awareness of the importance of poor adherence in chronic diseases, and of the potential to \ndevelop interventions to improve adherence.487 Approximately 50% of adults and children on long- term therapy for asthma \nfail to take medications as directed at least part of the time.190 \nIn clinical practice, poor adherence may be identified by an empathic question that acknowledges the likelihood of incomplete adherence and encourages an open discussion. See Box 5-3 ( p.112) for examples. Checking the date of the \nlast prescription or the date on the inhaler may assist in identifying poor adherence. In some health systems, pharmacists can assist in identifying poorly adherent patients by monitoring dispensing records. Electronic inhaler monitoring has also been used in clinical practice to identify poor adherence in patients with difficult -to-treat asthma.\n176,177 \nIn clinical studies  assessing  factors contributing to poor adherence, methods of measuring adherence include using short \nadherence behavior questionnaires, analysis of dispensing records , dose or pill counting , electronic inhaler \nmonitoring,488,489 and drug assay (e.g., for prednisolone).490 \nFactors contributing to poor adherence  \nTo understand the reasons behind patients’  medication -taking behavior , it is important to elicit their  beliefs and concerns \nabout asthma and asthma medications. Both intentional and unintentional factors  contribut e to poor adherence ( Box 5-3, \np.112). Issues of ethnicity,491 health literacy,492,493 and numeracy201 are often overlooked.

It should be taken every day or, as an alternative in mild asthma, by as -needed ICS -\nformoterol for symptom relief.  \nRefer patients with difficult -to-treat or severe asthma to a specialist or severe asthma service, after addressing common \nproblems such as incorrect diagnosis, incorrect inhaler technique, ongoing environmental exposures, and poor adherence \n(see Section 8, p. 139).  \nWomen with asthma who are pregnant or planning pregnancy should be advised not to stop ICS -containing therapy, as \nexacerbations increase the risk of adverse perinatal outcomes. The advantages of actively treating asthma in pregnancy \nwith ICS -containing therapy markedly outweigh any potential risks of these  medications.  \nMANAGING MU LTIMORBIDITY \nMultimorbidity  is a common pr oblem in patients w ith chronic d iseases s uch as asthma.

        "text": "121 MANAGING ASTHMA DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC  \nAre people with asthma at higher risk of COVID -19 or severe COVID -19? \nPeople with asthma do not appear to be at increased risk of acquiring COVID -19, and systematic reviews have not shown \nan increased risk of severe COVID -19 in people with well -controlled mild -to-moderate asthma. Overall, studies to date \nindicate that people with well -controlled asthma are not at increased risk of COVID -19-related death,562,563 and in one \nmeta- analysis, mortality appeared to be lower than in people without asthma.564 However, the risk of COVID -19 death was \nincreased in people who had recently needed oral corticosteroids ( OCS ) for their asthma,454,562 and in hospitalized patients \nwith severe asthma.454,565 Therefore, it is important to continue good asthma management (as described in the GINA \nStrategy Report), with strategies to maintain good symptom control, reduce the risk of severe exacerbations and minimize \nthe need for OCS. In one study of hospitalized patients aged ≥50 years with COVID -19, mortality was lower among those \nwith asthma who were using ICS than in patients without an underlying respiratory condition.565 \nIn 2020 and 2021, many countries recorded a reduction in asthma exacerbations and influenza- related illness. The \nreasons are not precisely known, but may be due to handwashing, masks and social/physical distancing that reduced the incidence of other respiratory infections, including influenza.\n455 \nDuring pandemic  conditions , advise patients with asthma to continue taking their prescribed asthma \nmedications, particularly inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) -containing medications, and OCS if prescribed  \nIt is important for patients to continue taking their prescribed asthma medications as usual during the COVID -19 \npandemic. This includes ICS -containing medications (alone or in combination with a long-acting beta 2 agonist ( LABA) , and \nadd-on therapy including biologic therapy for severe asthma. Stopping ICS often leads to potentially dangerous worsening \nof asthma. See Section 4 (p. 67) for information about asthma medications and regimens and non- pharmacologic \nstrategies, and Section 5 (p. 108) for guided asthma self -management education and skills training.  \nFor a small proportion of patients with severe asthma, long- term OCS may sometimes be needed, and it is very \ndangerous to stop these suddenly. See Section 8 (p. 139) for advice about investigation and management of difficult -to-\ntreat and severe asthma, including addition of biologic therapy for minimizing use of OCS.  \nAdvise patients to discuss with you before stopping any asthma medication.  \nMake sure that all patients have a written asthma action plan  \nA written action plan (printed, digital or pictorial) tells the patient how to recognize worsening asthma, how to increase their reliever and maintenance medications, and when to seek medical help. A short course of OCS may be needed during severe asthma flare- ups (exacerbations). See Box 9- 2 (p.162) for more information about specific action plan options for \nincreasing reliever medications (or reliever and maintenance medications), depending on the patient’s usual therapeutic \nregimen.  \nAt present, there is no clear evidence about how to distinguish between worsening asthma due to respiratory viral \ninfections such as rhinovirus and influenza, and COVID -19. \nIf local risk of COVID -19 is moderate or high, avoid use of nebulizers where possible due to the risk of \ntransmitting infection to other patients/family and to healthcare workers  \nNebulizers can transmit respiratory viral particles across distances of at least 1 m. Use of nebulizers for delivering bronchodilator therapy is mainly restricted to management of life- threatening asthma in acute care settings. Instead, to \ndeliver short -acting beta\n2 agonist for acute asthma in adults and children, use a pressurized metered- dose inhaler and \nspacer, with a mouthpiece or tightly fitting face mask, if required. Check the manufacturer’s instructions about whether a spacer can be autoclaved. If not (as is the case for many types of spacers), or if in doubt, spacers should be restricted to \nsingle patient use. If use of a nebulizer is needed in settings where COVID -19 infection is possible, strict infection control \nprocedures should be followed.  \nCOPYRIGHTED MATERIAL - DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE"

If spirometry is not available due t\no local infection control restrictions, and information about lung function is needed, consider asking patients to \nmonitor lung function at home.  \nFollow infection control recommendations if any aerosol -generating procedures are needed  \nOther aerosol -generating procedures include oxygen therapy (including with nasal prongs), sputum induction, manual \nventilation, non- invasive ventilation and intubation. CDC recommendations are found here. Follow local health advice \nabout hygiene strategies and use of personal protective equipment, as new information becomes available in your country or region.  \nThe CDC website provides up- to-da\n te information about COVID -19 for health professionals here , and for patients here . \nThe website of the World Health Organization (WHO) provides comprehensive advice for health professionals and health systems about prevention and management of COVID -19 here. \nManagement of asthma if the patient acquires COVID -19 \nPeople with asthma who acquire COVID -19 are not at higher risk of severe COVID -19. However, be aware that those with \npoorly controlled asthma (e.g. , recent need for OCS) are at higher risk of hospitalization for severe disease if they acquire \nCOVID -19.454,562, 565 Advise patients to continue taking their usual asthma medications. Patients with severe asthma should \ncontinue biologic therapy or OCS, if prescribed.  \nTo reduce the risk of transmitting infection, as above, avoid use of nebulizers where possible (use a pressurized metered-\ndose inhaler  [pMDI ] and spacer instead), avoid spirometry, and instruct patients to avoid sharing of inhalers/spacers.  \nBefore prescribing antiviral therapies, consult local prescribing guidelines. Check carefully for potential interactions between asthma therapy and COVID -19 therapy. For example, ritonavir -boosted nirmatrelvir (NMV/r) is a potent CYP3A4 \ninhibitor. While this is unlikely to cause clinically important corticosteroid- related adverse effects, because of the short \nduration of anti -COVID -19 treatment, be cautious if considering prescribing NMV/r for patients taking ICS -salmeterol or \nICS-vilanterol, as the interaction may increase cardiac toxicity of the LABA.\n157 Product information indicates that for \npatients taking ICS -salmeterol or ICS -vilanterol, concomitant treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors is not recommended. \nSome drug interaction websites advise stopping ICS -salmeterol or ICS -vilanterol during NMV/r treatment and for a few \ndays afterwards, but this may increase the risk of an asthma exacerbation. Instead, consider prescribing alternative antiviral therapy (if available) or switching to ICS alone or ICS -formoterol (if available) for the duration of NVM/r therapy \nand a further 5 days.\n157 If switching to a different inhaler, remember to teach correct technique with the new inhaler.  \nAdvise people with asthma to be up to date with COVID -19 vaccines  \nMany types of COVID -19 vaccines have been studied and are in use. New evidence about the vaccines, including in \npeople with asthma, will emerge over time. In general, allergic reactions to the vaccines are rare. Patients with a history of severe allergic reaction to a COVID -19 vaccine ingredient (e.g., polyethylene glycol for Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna, or \npolysorbate 80 for AstraZeneca or J&J/Janssen) should receive a different COVID -19 vaccine. However, people with \nanaphylaxis to foods, insect venom, or other medications can safely receive COVID -19 vaccines. More details from the \nUS Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) are here. As always, patients should speak to their healthcare \nprovider if they have concerns. Follow local advice about monitoring patients after COVID -19 vaccination.  \nUsual vaccine precautions apply. For example, ask if the patient has a history of allergy to any components of the vaccine, and \nif the patient has a fever or another infection, delay vaccination until they are well.  \nCOPYRIGHTED MATERIAL - DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE"

Each of these ‘umbrella’ labels includes several different patterns of clinical features (phenotypes) that may overlap. Each may also include different inflammatory patterns and different underlying mechanisms, some of which may be common to both asthma and COPD.\n627 \nThe most easily recognized phenotypes of asthma and COPD such as allergic asthma in children/young adults and \nemphysema in older smokers are clearly distinguishable. Regulatory studies of pharmacotherapy in asthma and COPD \nare largely restricted to patients with very clearly defined asthma or COPD. However, in the community, the features of asthma and COPD may overlap, especially in older adults.  \nThere are extremely important differences in treatment recommendations for asthma and COPD . In particular, \ntreatment with long- acting bronchodilators alone (i.e. , without ICS) is recommended for initial treatment in COPD\n72 but is \ncontraindicated in asthma due to the risk of severe exacerbations and death.151,400, 628,629 Several studies have also shown \nthat patients with diagnoses of both asthma and COPD are at increased risk of hospitalization or death if they are treated with LABA or LABA -LAMA, compared with ICS -LABA (or ICS -LABA- LAMA).\n630-632 \nChallenges in clinical diagnosis of asthma and COPD  \nAlthough asthma is characterized by variable expiratory airflow limitation, at least initially (Box 1- 2, p.26), and COPD is \ncharacterized by persistent airflow limitation,72 the definitions of asthma and COPD are not mutually exclusive (Box 7- 1, \np.133). This means that clinical features are also important in making a diagnosis and treating appropriately.  \nI\nn children and young adults with chronic or recurrent respiratory symptoms, the differential diagnosis is different from that \nin older adults (see Box 1-3 , p.27). Once infectious disease and nonpulmonary conditions (e.g., congenital heart disease, \ninducible laryngeal obstruction) have been excluded, the most likely chronic airway disease in children and young adults is \nasthma.  \nHowever, in adults with a history of long- standing asthma,633,634 persistent airflow limitation may be found.635-639 \nDistinguishing this from COPD is problematic, especially if they are smokers or have other risk factors for COPD.640-643 On \nthe other hand, patients with COPD may show evidence of reversible airflow obstruction when a rapid- acting \nbronchodilator is administered, a feature more strongly associated with asthma. In medical records, such patients often are assigned both diagnoses.\n74,644 \nCOPYRIGHTED MATERIAL - DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE"

Another common descriptor is ‘asthma+COPD ’. \n‘Asthma -COPD overlap ’ is a descriptor for patients often seen in clinical practice, who comprise a heterogeneous \ngroup. It does not mean a single disease entity.  \nBox 7- 1. Current definitions of asthma and COPD, and clinical description of asthma -COPD overlap  \nAsthma  (GINA)  \nAsthma is a heterogeneous disease, usually characterized by chronic airway inflammation. It is defined by the \nhistory of respiratory symptoms such as wheeze, shortness of breath, chest tightness and cough that vary over time \nand in intensity, together with variable expiratory airflow limitation.  \nCOPD  (GOLD) \nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous lung condition characterized by chronic respiratory symptoms (dyspnea, cough, sputum production and/or exacerbations) due to abnormalities of the \nairways (bronchitis, bronchiolitis) and/or alveoli (emphysema) that cause persistent, often progressive, airflow \nobstruction .72 \nAsthma+COPD, also called asthma- COPD overlap  (descriptive term)  \n‘Asthma -COPD overlap ’ and ‘ asthma +COPD ’ are terms used to collectively describe patients who have persistent \nairflow limitation together with clinical features that are consistent with both asthma and COPD.  \nThis is not a definition of a single disease entity, but a descriptive term for clinical use that includes several different \nclinical phenotypes reflecting different underlying mechanisms.  \nPrevalence and morbidity of asthma- COPD overlap  \nIn epidemiological studies, reported prevalence rates for asthma+COPD have ranged between 9% and 55% of those with either diagnosis, with variation by gender and age;\n638,645-647 the wide range reflects the different criteria that have been \nused by different investigators. Concurrent doctor -diagnosed asthma and COPD has been reported in between 15 and \n32% of patients with one or other diagnosis.644,648, 649 \nThere is broad agreement that patients with features of both asthma and COPD have a greater burden of symptoms,650 \nexperience frequent exacerbations,74,636,650 have poor quality of life,74,645 ,650 a more rapid decline in lung function,650 higher \nmortality,636,644 and greater use of healthcare  resources74,651 compared with patients with asthma or COPD alone.  \nASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC RESPIRATORY SYMPTOMS  \n1: History and clinical assessment \nEstablish:  \n• The nature and pattern of respiratory symptoms (variable and/or persistent)  \n• History of asthma diagnosis; childhood and/or current  \n• Exposure history: smoking and/or other exposures to risk factors for COPD.  \nThe features that are most helpful in identifying and distinguishing asthma from COPD, and the features that should \nprompt a patient to be treated as asthma to reduce the risk of severe exacerbations and death, are shown in Box 7-2 \n(p.134).\nCOPYRIGHTED MATERIAL - DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE"

Pharmacotherapy is based on ICS to \nreduce the risk of severe exacerbations and death and to improve symptom control, with add- on treatment as required, \ne.g., add- on LABA and/or LAMA. As -needed low -dose ICS -formoterol may be used as the reliever, on its own in mild \nasthma or in addition to maintenance ICS -formoterol in patients with moderate- severe asthma prescribed maintenance-\nand-reliever  therapy (see Box 4-6 , p.77). Inhaled therapy should be optimized to minimize the need for oral corticosteroids \n(OCS).  \nFor COPD  \nCommence treatment as in the current GOLD strategy report.72 Pharmacotherapy starts with symptomatic treatment with \nlong-acting bronchodilators (LABA and LAMA). Use of ICS is strongly favored as per GOLD 2024 for patients with \nhospitalizations in the last year, ≥2 exacerbations/year requiring OCS, or blood eosinophils ≥300/ µL, or with a history of \nasthma or concomitant asthma. However, ICS should not be used alone without LABA and/or LAMA. Inhaled therapy \nshould be optimized to reduce the need for OCS. In patients with features of COPD, high- dose ICS should be avoided \nbecause of the risk of pneumonia.652,653 \nFor patients with features of asthma and COPD  \nStart treatment as for asthma (Box 4-4, p.75 and Box 4-5, p.76) until further investigations have been performed.  \nICS are essential  in preventing morbidity and even death in patients with uncontrolled asthma symptoms, for whom even \nseemingly ‘mild’ symptoms (compared to those of moderate or severe COPD) might indicate significant risk of a life-\nthreatening attack.654 For patients with asthma+COPD, ICS should be used initially in a low or medium dose (see Box  4-2, \np.71), depending on level of symptoms and risk of adverse effects, including pneumonia.  \nP\natients with features or diagnosis of both asthma and COPD will usually also require add- on treatment with LABA and/or \nLAMA to provide adequate symptom control.  \nPatients with any features of asthma should not be treated with LABA and/or LAMA alone, without ICS.  A large \ncase -control study in community patients with newly diagnosed COPD found that those who also had a diagnosis of \nasthma had a lower risk of COPD hospitalizations and death if treated with combination ICS -LABA than with LABA \nalone.630 In another large retrospective longitudinal population cohort study of patients aged ≥66 years, those recorded as \nhaving asthma with COPD had lower morbidity and hospitalizations if they received ICS treatment; a similar benefit was \nseen in those with COPD plus concurrent asthma.632 \nAll patients with chronic airflow limitation  \nProvide advice, as described in the GINA and GOLD reports, about:  \n• Treatment of modifiable risk factors including advice about smoking cessation  \n• Treatment of comorbidities  \n• Non- pharmacological strategies including physical activity, and, for COPD or asthma- COPD overlap, pulmonary \nrehabilitation and vaccinations  \n• Appropriate self -management strategies  \n• Regular follow -up. \nIn a majority of patients, the initial management of asthma and COPD can be satisfactorily carried out at primary care level. However, both the GINA and GOLD strategy reports recommend referral for further diagnostic procedures at \nrelevant points in patient management (see below). This may be particularly important for patients with features of both \nasthma and COPD, given that this is associated with worse outcomes and greater healthcare  utilization.  \nCOPYRIGHTED MATERIAL - DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE"

Difficult- to-treat and severe asthma in adults and adolescents  \nKEY POINTS  \nWhat are difficult -to-treat asthma and severe asthma?  \n• Difficult -to-treat asthma is asthma that is uncontrolled despite prescribing of medium or high- dose treatment  with the \ncombination of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and long- acting beta 2 agonist (LABA),  or that requires high- dose ICS -LABA \ntreatment to maintain good symptom control and reduce exacerbations. It does not mean a ‘difficult patient’.  \n• Severe asthma is asthma that is uncontrolled despite adherence with optimized high- dose ICS -LABA therapy and \ntreatment of contributory factors, or that worsens when high- dose treatment is decreased. Approximately 3– 10% of \npeople with asthma have severe asthma.  \n• Severe asthma places a large physical, mental, emotional, social and economic burden on patients. It is often \nassociated with multimorbidity.  \nHow should these patients be assessed?  \n• Assess all patients with difficult -to-treat asthma to confirm the diagnosis of asthma, and to identify and manage factors \nthat may be contributing to symptoms, poor quality of life, or exacerbations.  \n• Refer for expert advice at any stage, or if asthma does not improve in response to optimizing treatment.  \n• For patients with persistent symptoms and/or exacerbations despite high- dose ICS -containing therapy  (with good \nadherence and correct inhaler technique), the clinical or inflammatory phenotype should be assessed, as this may \nguide the selection of add- on treatment.  \nManagement of severe asthma  \n• Depending on the inflammatory phenotype and other clinical features, add- on treatments for severe asthma include \nlong-acting muscarinic antagonist s (LAMA) , leukotriene receptor antagonist s (LTRA s), low-dose azithromycin (adults), \nand biologic agents for severe asthma.  \n• Low-dose maintenance oral corticosteroids ( OCS ) should be considered only as a last resort if no other options are \navailable, because of their serious cumulative long-term side- effects.  \n• Assess the response to any add- on treatment, stop ineffective treatments, and consider other options.  \n• Utilize specialist multidisciplinary team care for severe asthma, if available.  \n• For patients with severe asthma, continue to optimize patient care in collaboration with the primary care clinician, and \nconsidering the patient’s social and emotional needs.  \n• Invite patients with severe asthma to enroll in a registry or clinical trial, if available and relevant, to help fill evidenc e \ngaps.  \n• See Boxes 8- 2 through 8-5 (starting on p. 142) for the GINA severe asthma decision tree.  \n• Although the majority of patients can achieve the goal of long- term well controlled asthma, some patients’ asthma will \nnot be well controlled even with optimal therapy.

In many cases, asthma may appear to \nbe difficult to treat because of modifiable factors such as incorrect inhaler technique, poor adherence, smoking or \ncomorbidities, or because the diagnosis is incorrect.  \nSevere asthma is a subset of difficult -to-t reat asthma (Box 8-1 ). It means asthma that is uncontrolled despite adherence \nwith maximal optimized high- dose ICS -LABA treatment and management of contributory factors, or that worsens when \nhigh-dose treatment is decreased.175 At present, therefore, ‘severe asthma’ is a retrospective label. It is sometimes called \n‘severe refractory asthma’ ,175 because  it is defined by being relatively refractory  to high- dose inhaled therapy. However, \nwith the advent of biologic therapies, the word ‘refractory’ is no longer appropriate.  \nAsthma is not classified as severe if it markedly improves when contributory factors such as inhaler technique and \nadher\nence are addressed.175 \nPREVALENCE: HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE SEVERE ASTHMA?  \nA study in the Netherlands estimated that around 3.7% of asthma patients have severe asthma, based on the number of patients prescribed high- dose ICS -LABA, or medium or high- dose ICS -LABA plus long- term OCS, who had poor symptom \ncontrol (by Asthma Control Questionnaire) and had good adherence and inhaler technique (Box 8-1 ).\n655 \nBox 8-1 .

        "text": "141 IMPORTANCE: THE IMPACT OF SEVERE ASTHMA  \nThe patient perspective \nPatients with severe asthma experience a heavy burden of symptoms, exacerbations and medication side- effects. \nFrequent shortness of breath, wheeze, chest tightness and cough interfere with day -to-day living, sleeping, and physical \nactivity, and patients often have frightening or unpredictable exacerbations (also called attacks or severe flare- ups).  \nMedication side- effects are particularly common and problematic with OCS,393 which in the past were a mainstay of \ntreatment for severe asthma. Adverse effects of long- term or frequent OCS include obesity, diabetes, osteoporosis and \nfragility fractures,601 cataracts, hypertension and adrenal suppression; psychological side- effects such as depression and \nanxiety are particularly concerning for patients.656 Even short -term use of OCS is associated with sleep disturbance, and \nincreased risk of infection, fracture and thromboembolism.571 Strategies to minimize need for OCS are therefore a high \npriority.  \nSevere asthma often interferes with family, social and working life, limits career choices and vacation options, and affects \nemot\nional and mental health. Patients with severe asthma often feel alone and misunderstood, as their experience is so \ndifferent from that of most people with asthma.656 \nAdolescents with severe asthma  \nThe teenage years are a time of great psychological and physiological development which can impact on asthma \nmanagement. It is vital to ensure that the young person has a good understanding of their condition and treatment and appropriate knowledge to enable supported self -management. The process of transition from pediatric to adult care should \nhelp support the young person in gaining greater autonomy and responsibility for their own health and wellbeing. Severe asthma may improve over 3 years in approximately 30% of male and female adolescents; the only predictor of asthma \nbecoming non- severe was higher baseline blood eosinophils.\n657 Studies with longer follow -up time are needed.  \nHealthcare  utilization and costs  \nSevere asthma has very high healthcare costs due to medications, physician visits, hospitalizations, and the costs of OCS \nside-effects. In a UK study, healthcare costs per patient were higher than for type 2 diabetes, stroke, or COPD.658 In a \nCanadian study, severe uncontrolled asthma was estimated to account for more than 60% of asthma costs.659 \nPatients with severe asthma and their families also bear a significant financial burden, not only for medical care and \nmedications, but also through lost earnings and career choices.  \nOVERVIEW OF DECISION TREE FOR ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT OF DIFFICULT -TO-TREAT \nAND SEVERE ASTHMA \nThe clinical decision tree (from p. 142), provides brief information about what should be considered in each phase of \ndiagnosis and management of difficult -to-treat and severe asthma. The decision tree is divided into three broad stages : \nStages 1–4 (green) are for use in primary care and/or specialist care.  \nStages 5–8 (blue) are mainly relevant to respiratory specialists.  \nStages 9–10 (brown) are about maintaining ongoing collaborative care between the patient, primary care physician, \nspecialist and other health professionals.  \nDevelopment of the Severe Asthma Guide and decision tree included extensive collaboration with experts in human-centered design to enhance the utility of these resources for end- users. This included translating existing high- level \nflowcharts and text -based information to a more detailed visual format, and applying information architecture and \ndiagramming principles.  \nThe decision tree is followed by more detailed information on each stage of assessment and management.  \nCOPYRIGHTED MATERIAL - DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE"

Confirm  the diagnosis (asthma or differential diagnoses)  \nStages 1– 5 can be carried out in primary or specialist care. A patient is classified as having difficult -to-treat asthma if they \npatient have persistent asthma symptoms and/or exacerbations despite prescribing of medium or high- dose ICS with \nanother controller such as LABA, or maintenance OCS, or require high- dose ICS -LABA treatment to maintain good \nsymptom control and prevent exacerbations. Difficult -to-treat asthma does not mean a ‘difficult patient’.  \nConsider referral to a specialist or severe asthma clinic at any stage, particularly if:  \n• There is difficulty confirming the diagnosis of asthma  \n• Patient has frequent urgent healthcare utilization  \n• Patient needs frequent or maintenance OCS  \n• Occupational asthma is suspected  \n• Food allergy or anaphylaxis, as this increases the risk of death  \n• Symptoms are suggestive of infective or cardiac cause \n• Symptoms are suggestive of complications such as bronchiectasis  \n• Patient has multimorbidity.  \nAre the symptoms due to asthma?  \nPerform a careful history and physical examination to identify whether symptoms are typical of asthma, or are more likely \ndue to an alternative diagnosis or comorbidity:  \n• Dyspnea: COPD, obesity, cardiac disease, deconditioning  \n• Cough: inducible laryngeal obstruction (also called vocal cord dysfunction, VCD), upper airway cough syndrome (also called post -nasal drip), gastro- esophageal reflux disease (GERD), bronchiectasis, angiotensin- converting enzyme \n(ACE) inhibitors  \n• Wheeze: obesity, COPD, tracheobronchomalacia, VCD.  \nInvestigate according to clinical suspicion and age (see Box 1 -3, p.27).  \nHow can the diagnosis of asthma be confirmed?  \nConfirmation of the diagnosis is important, because in 12– 50% of people assumed to have severe asthma, asthma is not \nfound to be the correct diagnosis.\n660 Perform spirometry, before and after bronchodilator, to assess baseline lung function \nand seek objective evidence of variable expiratory airflow limitation. If initial bronchodilator responsiveness testing is negative (≤200 mL or ≤12% increase in FEV\n1), consider repeating after withholding bronchodilators or when symptomatic, \nor consider stepping controller treatment up or down before further investigations such as bronchial provocation testing (see Box 1-4 , p.30). Check full flow -v\n olume curve to assess for upper airway obstruction. If spirometry is normal or is not \navailable, provide the patient with a peak flow meter and diary for assessing variability; consider bronchial provocation testing if patient is able to withhold bronchodilators ( short -acting beta\n2 agonist [ SABA ] for at least 6 hours, LABA for up to \n2 days depending on duration of action).41 Strategies for confirming the diagnosis of asthma in patients already taking \nICS-containing treatment are shown in Box 1-4 (p.30). \nA\nirflow limitation may be persistent in patients with long- standing asthma, due to remodeling of the airway walls, or limited \nlung development in childhood. It is important to document lung function when the diagnosis of asthma is first made. Specialist advice should be obtained if the history is suggestive of asthma but the diagnosis cannot be confirmed by spirometry.  \n  \nCOPYRIGHTED MATERIAL - DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE"

        "text": "147 2. Look for factors contributing to symptoms and exacerbations  \nSystematically consider factors that may be contributing to uncontrolled symptoms or exacerbations, or poor quality of life, \nand that can be treated. The most important modifiable factors include:  \n• Incorrect inhaler technique (seen in up to 80% patients): ask the patient to show you how they use their inhaler; \ncompare with a checklist or video.  \n• Suboptimal adherence (up to 75% asthma patients): ask empathically about frequency of use (e.g., ‘Many patients \ndon’t use their inhaler as prescribed. In the last 4 weeks, how many days a week have you been taking it – not at all, \n1 day a week, 2, 3 or more?’ or, ‘Do you find it easier to remember your inhaler in the morning or the evening?’ (see \nBox 5-3, p.112). Ask about barriers to medication use, including cost, and concerns about necessity or side- effects. \nCheck dates on inhalers and view dispensing data, if available. Electronic inhaler monitoring, if available, can be helpful in screening for poor adherence, in some cases avoiding the need for biologic therapy .\n661 \n• Comorbidities : review history and examination for comorbidities that can contribute to respiratory symptoms, \nexacerbations, or poor quality of life. These include anxiety and depression, obesity, deconditioning, chronic rhinosinusitis, inducible laryngeal obstruction, GERD, COPD, obstructive sleep apnea, bronchiectasis, cardiac disease, and kyphosis due to osteoporosis. Investigate according to clinical suspicion.  \n• Modifiable risk factors and triggers : identify factors that increase the risk of exacerbations, e.g.,  smoking, \nenvironmental tobacco exposure, other environmental exposures at home or work including allergens (if sensitized), \nindoor and outdoor air pollution, molds and noxious chemicals, and medications such as beta- blockers or non-\nsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). For allergens, check for sensitization using skin prick testing or specific \nIgE. \n• Regular or over -use of SABAs : regular SABA use causes beta- receptor down- regulation and reduction in response,\n662 \nleading in turn to greater use. Over -use may also be habitual. Dispensing of ≥3 SABA canisters per year \n(corresponding to average use more than daily) is associated with increased risk of emergency department visit or hospitalization independent of severity,\n86,87 and dispensing of ≥12 canisters per year (one a month) is associated with \nsubstantially increased risk of death.87,89 Risks are higher with nebulized SABA.663 \n• Anxiety, depression and social and economic problems : these are very common in asthma, particularly in difficult \nasthma656 and contribute to symptoms, impaired quality of life, and poor adherence.  \n• Medication side- effects : systemic effects, particularly with frequent or continuous OCS, or long- term high- dose ICS \nmay contribute to poor quality of life and increase the likelihood of poor adherence. Local side- effects of dysphonia or \ncandidiasis may occur with high- dose or potent ICS, especially if inhaler technique is poor. Consider drug interactions \nincluding risk of adrenal suppression with use of P450 inhibitors such as itraconazole.  \n3. Review and optimize management  \nReview and optimize treatment for asthma, and for comorbidities and risk factors identified at  Stage 2. For more details, \nsee Section 6 (p. 117). \n• Provide asthma self -management education, and confirm that patient has (and knows how to use) a personalized \nwritten or electronic asthma action plan. Refer to an asthma educator if available.  \n• Optimize asthma medications : confirm that the inhaler is suitable for the patient; check and correct inhaler technique \nwith a physical demonstration and teach- back method, check inhaler technique again at each visit.664 Address \nsuboptimal adherence, both intentional and unintentional.506 Switch to ICS -formoterol maintenance- and-reliever \ntherapy  if available, to reduce the risk of exacerbations.224 \n• Consider non- pharmacologic add- on therapy , e.g., smoking cessation, physical exercise,233 healthy diet, weight loss, \nmucus clearance strategies, influenza vaccination, breathing exercises, allergen avoidance, if feasible, for patients \nwho are sensitized and exposed.

Refer for management of mental health problems if relevant.  \n• Consider trial of non- biologic medication added to medium/high dose ICS, e.g., LABA, LAMA, LTRA if not already \ntried. Note concerns about neuropsychiatric adverse effects with montelukast LTRA.295 \n• Consider trial of high -dose ICS -LABA  if not currently used.  \n4. Review response after approximately 3– 6 months \nSchedule a review visit to assess the response to the above interventions. Timing of the review visit depends on clinical \nurgency and what changes to treatment have been made.  \nWhen assessing the response to treatment, specifically review:  \n• Symptom control (symptom frequency, SABA reliever use, night waking due to asthma, activity limitation)  \n• Exacerbations since previous visit, and how they were managed  \n• Medication side- effects  \n• Inhaler technique and adherence \n• Lung function  \n• Patient satisfaction and concerns.  \nIs asthma still uncontrolled, despite optimized therapy?  \nYES: if asthma is still uncontrolled, the diagnosis of severe asthma has been confirmed. If not done by now, refer the \npatient to a specialist or severe asthma clinic if possible.  \nNO: if asthma is now well controlled, consider stepping down treatment. Start by decreasing/ceasing OCS first (if used), \nchecking for adrenal insufficiency, then remove other add- on therapy, then decrease ICS dose, but do not stop ICS. See \nBox 4-13 (p.102) for how to gradually down- titrate treatment intensity.  \nDoes asthma become uncontrolled when treatment is stepped down?  \nYES: if asthma symptoms become uncontrolled or an exacerbation occurs when high- dose treatment is stepped down, the \ndiagnosis of severe asthma has been confirmed. Restore the patient's previous dose to regain good asthma control, and \nrefer to a specialist or severe asthma clinic , if possible, if not done already.  \nNO: if symptoms and exacerbations remain well controlled despite treatment being stepped down, the patient does not \nhave severe asthma.

Investigate further and provide patient support  \nFurther assessment and management should be by a specialist, preferably in a multidisciplinary severe asthma clinic if \navailable. The team may include a certified asthma educator and health professionals from fields such as speech pathology, otorhinolaryngology, social work and mental health.  \nWhat other tests may be considered at the specialist level?  \nAdditional investigations may be appropriate for identifying less -common comorbidities and differential diagnoses \ncontributing to symptoms and/or exacerbations. Tests should be based on clinical suspicion, and may include:  \n• Blood tests: complete blood count, CRP, IgG, IgA, IgM, IgE, fungal precipitins including Aspergillus  \n• Allergy testing for clinically relevant allergens: skin prick test or specific IgE, if not already done  \n• Other pulmonary investigations: diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide ( DLCO ), chest X -ray or high-\nresolution chest computed tomography ( CT) \n• Bone density scan, because of risk of osteoporosis with maintenance or frequent OCS or long- term high- dose ICS\n395 \n• Other directed testing based on clinical suspicion, e.g., antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies ( ANCA ), CT sinuses, \nB-natriuretic peptide ( BNP), echocardiogram.  \nIf blood eosinophils are ≥300/µL, look for and treat non -asthma causes, including parasites (e.g.,  Strongyloides serology \nor stool examination), because parasitic infection may be the cause of the blood eosinophilia, and because OCS or biologic therapy in a patient with untreated parasitic infection could potentially lead to disseminated disease. Strongyloides infection is usually asymptomatic.\n665 \nIf hypereosinophilia is found, e.g., blood eosinophils ≥1500/µL, consider causes such as eosinophilic granulomatosis with \npolyangiitis (EGPA).  \nConsider need for social/psychological support  \nRefer patients to support services, where available, to help them deal with the emotional, social and financial burden of \nasthma and its treatment, including during and after severe exacerbations.656 Consider the need for psychological or \npsychiatric referral, including for patients with anxiety and/or depression.  \nInvolve multidisciplinary team care (if available)  \nMul\ntidisciplinary assessment and treatment of patients with severe asthma increases the identification of comorbidities, \nand improves outcomes.666 \nInvite patient to enroll in a registry (if available) or clinical trial (if appropriate)  \nSystematic collection of data will help in understanding the mechanisms and burden of severe asthma. There is a need for \npragmatic clinical trials in severe asthma, including studies comparing two or more active treatments. Participants in \nrandomized controlled trials designed for regulatory purposes may not necessarily be representative of patients seen in clinical practice. For example, a registry study found that over 80% of patients with severe asthma would have been excluded from key studies evaluating biologic therapy.\n369 \n6. Assess the severe asthma phenotype  \nThe next step is to assess the patient’s inflammatory phenotype – is it Type 2 high or low?  \nWhat is Type 2 inflammation?  \nType 2 inflammation is found in the majority of people with severe asthma. It is characterized by cytokines such as interleukin (IL) -4, IL- 5 and IL- 13, which are often produced by the adaptive immune system on recognition of allergens. It \nmay also be activated by viruses, bacteria and irritants that stimulate the innate immune system via production of IL- 33, \nIL-25 and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) by epithelial cells. Type 2 inflammation is often characterized by elevated \nCOPYRIGHTED MATERIAL - DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE"

In severe asthma, Type 2 inflammation may be relatively refractory to high- dose ICS. \nIt may respond to OCS but their serious adverse effects225,393 mean that alternative treatments should be sought.  \nIn adult patients with uncontrolled asthma despite medium- or high -dose ICS plus LABA or other controllers, a history of \nexacerbations in the previous year, higher blood eosinophil counts and higher FeNO levels are associated with a greater risk of severe exacerbations.\n668 \nCould the patient have refractory or underlying Type 2 inflammation?  \nThe possibility of refractory Type 2 inflammation should be considered if any of the following are found while the patient is  \ntaking high- dose ICS or daily OCS:  \n• Blood eosinophils ≥150/μ L, and/or  \n• FeNO ≥20 ppb, and/or  \n• Sputum eosinophils ≥2%, and/or  \n• Asthma is clinically allergen -driven.  \nPatients requiring maintenance OCS may also have underlying Type 2 inflammation. However, biomarkers of Type 2 inflammation (blood eosinophils, sputum eosinophils and FeNO) are often suppressed by OCS. If possible, therefore, \nthese tests should be performed before starting OCS (a short course, or maintenance treatment), or at least 1 –2 weeks \nafter a course of OCS, or on the lowest possible OCS dose.  \nThe above criteria are suggested for initial assessment; those for blood eosinophils and FeNO are based on the lowest \nlevels associated with response to some biologics. They are not the criteria for eligibility for Type 2- targeted biologic \ntherapy, which may differ – see section 8 and local criteria.  \nConsider repeating blood eosinophils and FeNO up to 3 times (e.g., when asthma worsens, before giving OCS, or at least 1–2 weeks after a course of OCS, or on the lowest possible OCS dose), before assuming asthma is non- Type 2. One \nstudy of patients with uncontrolled asthma taking medium- to high- dose ICS -LABA found that 65% had a shift in their \nblood eosinophil category over 48– 56 weeks.\n669 \nWhy is the inflammatory phenotype assessed on high- dose ICS?  \n• Most RCT evidence about Type 2 targeted biologics is in such patients.  \n• Modifiable ICS treatment problems such as poor adherence and incorrect inhaler technique are common causes of uncontrolled Type 2 inflammation.  \n• Currently, the high cost of biologic therapies generally precludes their widespread clinical use in patients whose symptoms or exacerbations and Type 2 biomarkers are found to respond to ICS when it is taken correctly.  \n7.1. Consider other treatments if there is no evidence of Type 2 inflammation  \nIf the patient has no evidence of persistent Type 2 inflammation (section 6):  \n• Review the basics for factors that may be contributing to symptoms or exacerbations: differential diagnosis, inhaler technique, adherence, comorbidities, medication side- effects (Section 2).  \n• Recommend avoidance of relevant exposures (tobacco smoke, pollution, allergens if sensitized and there is evidence of benefit from withdrawal, irritants, infections). Ask about exposures at home and at work.  \n• Consider additional diagnostic investigations (if available and not already done): sputum induction to confirm inflammatory phenotype, high resolution chest CT, bronchoscopy to exclude unusual comorbidities or alternative diagnoses such as tracheobronchomalacia or sub- glottic stenosis , functional laryngoscopy for inducible laryngeal \nobstruction.  \nCOPYRIGHTED MATERIAL - DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE"

The \nterm ‘flare- up’ is preferable for use in discussions with most patients.  \n• Patients who are at increased risk of asthma- related death should be identified, and flagged for more frequent review.  \nWritten asthma action plans  \n• All patients should be provided with a written (i.e., printed, digital or pictorial) asthma action plan appropriate for their  \nage, their current treatment regimen and their reliever inhaler (short -acting beta 2 agonist [SABA] or combination \ninhaled corticosteroids [ICS] -formoterol), their level of asthma control, and their health literacy, so they know how to \nrecognize and respond to worsening asthma.  \n• On the action plan, state when and how to change reliever and/or maintenance medications, use oral corticosteroids \n(OCS) if needed, and access medical care if symptoms fail to respond to treatment.  \n• Advise patients who have a history of rapid deterioration to go to an acute care facility or see their doctor immediately \ntheir asthma starts to worsen.  \n• Base the action plan on changes in symptoms or (only in adults) peak expiratory flow (PEF).  \nManagement of exacerbations in a primary care or acute care facility  \n• Assess exacerbation severity from the degree of dyspnea, respiratory rate, pulse rate, oxygen saturation and lung \nfunction, while starting SABA and oxygen therapy. Infection control procedures should be followed.  \n• Arrange immediate transfer to an acute care facility if there are signs of severe exacerbation, or to intensive care if the \npatient is drowsy, confused, or has a silent chest. During transfer, give inhaled SABA and ipratropium bromide, \ncontrolled oxygen and systemic corticosteroids.  \n• Start treatment with repeated administration of SABA (in most patients, by pressurized metered- dose inhaler [pMDI] \nand spacer), early introduction of oral corticosteroids, and controlled flow oxygen if available. Review response of \nsymptoms, oxygen saturation and lung function after 1 hour. Give ipratropium bromide only for severe exacerbations. \nConsider intravenous magnesium sulfate for patients with severe exacerbations not responding to initial treatment.  \n• Do not routinely request a chest X- ray, and do not routinely prescribe antibiotics for asthma exacerbations.  \n• Decide about hospitalization based on the patient’s clinical status, lung function, response to treatment, recent and \npast history of exacerbations, and ability to manage at home.  \nDischarge management  \n• Arrange ongoing treatment before the patient goes home. This should include starting ICS -containing controller \ntreatment or stepping up the dose of existing ICS -containing treatment for 2– 4 weeks, and reducing reliever \nmedication to as -needed use.  \n• If the patient was using an anti- inflammatory reliever (e.g. , ICS-formoterol ) before the exacerbation  and this was \nreplaced with SABA during an emergency department or hospital stay, they should resume taking as -needed anti -\ninflammatory reliever instead of SABA reliever before or on discharge.

Such epidemics have been reported in association with springtime thunderstorms and either rye grass pollen or fungal spores,\n708 and with environmental exposure to soybean dust.704 \nIdentifying patients at risk of asthma -related death  \nIn addition to factors known to increase the risk of asthma exacerbations (Box 2- 2, p.37), some features are specifically \nassociated with an increase in the risk of asthma- related death (Box 9-1 , p.160). The presence of one or more of these \nrisk factors should be quickly identifiable in the clinical notes, and these patients should be encouraged to seek urgent medical care early in the course of an exacerbation.  \n \nCOPYRIGHTED MATERIAL - DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE"

However, the term ‘exacerbation’ is not suitable for use in clinical practice, as it \nis difficult for many patients to pronounce and remember.714,715 The term ‘flare- up’ is simpler, and conveys the sense that \nasthma is present even when symptoms are absent. The term ‘attack’ is used by many patients and healthcare providers \nbut with widely varying meanings, and it may not be perceived as including gradual worsening.714,715 In pediatric literature, \nthe term ‘episode’ is commonly used, but understanding of this term by parent/caregivers is not known.  \nDIAGNOSIS OF EXACERBATIONS  \nExacerbations represent a change in symptoms and lung function from the patient’s usual status.38 The decrease in \nexpiratory airflow can be quantified by lung function measurements such as PEF or forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV\n1),716 compared with the patient’s previous lung function or predicted values. In the acute setting, these \nmeasurements are more reliable indicators of the severity of the exacerbation than symptoms. The frequency of \nsymptoms may, however, be a more sensitive measure of the onset of an exacerbation than PEF.717 Consider the \npossibility of pertussis in a patient with an atypical exacerbation presentation, with predominant cough.  \nA minority of patients perceive airflow limitation poorly and can experience a significant decline in lung function without a \nc\nhange in symptoms.152,164, 172 This especially affects patients with a history of near -fatal asthma and also appears to be \nmore common in males. Regular PEF monitoring may be considered for such patients.  \nSevere exacerbations are potentially life- t hreatening, and their treatment requires careful assessment and close \nmonitoring. Patients with severe exacerbations should be advised to see their healthcare provider promptly or, depending \non the organization of local health services, to proceed to the nearest facility that provides emergency access for patients with acute asthma.  \nCOPYRIGHTED MATERIAL - DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE"

The definition of guided self -management education includes monitoring of \nsymptoms and/or lung function, a written asthma action plan, and regular review by a health professional.516 (For children \n5 years and younger, see Section 11, p. 185). A written (i.e., doc umented) asthma action plan may be printed, digital, or \npictorial, to suit the patient’s needs and literacy.  \nA written asthma action plan helps patients to recognize and respond appropriately to worsening asthma. It should include \nspecific instructions for the patient about changes to reliever and/or maintenance medications, when and how to use OCS if needed (Box 9-2 , p.162) and when and how to access medical care.  \nThe criteria for initiating an increase in maintenance medication will vary from patient to patient. In studies that evaluated \nan increase in maintenance ICS -containing treatment, this was usually initiated when there was a clinically important \nchange from the patient’s usual level of asthma control, for example, if asthma symptoms were interfering with normal \nactivities, or PEF had fallen by >20% for more than 2 days.\n521 \nFor patients prescribed an anti- inflammatory reliever (as -needed combination ICS- formoterol or ICS -SABA), this provides \na small extra dose of ICS as well as a rapid- acting bronchodilator without delay whenever the reliever is used, as the first \nstep in the patient’s action plan; this approach reduces the risk of progressing to severe exacerbation and need for oral corticosteroids. In the case of as -needed ICS -formoterol, both the ICS and the formoterol appear to contribute to the \nreduction in severe exacerbations compared with using a SABA reliever.\n399 See Box 4-8 (p.84) for more details about as -\nneeded ICS -formoterol, including medications and dosages.  \nA specific action plan template is available for patients prescribed maintenance- an d-reliever  therapy with ICS -\nformoterol;313 it can also be modified for patients prescribed as -needed- only ICS- formoterol.  \n   \nCOPYRIGHTED MATERIAL - DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE"

For adults \nand adolescents, the evidence is with use of budesonide- formoterol 200/6 mcg metered dose (160/4.5 mcg delivered \ndose) by dry -powder inhaler and, for children aged 6– 11 prescribed MART, budesonide- formoterol 100/6 mcg metered \ndose (80/4.5 mcg delivered dose) by dry -powder inhaler. Patients prescribed ICS -formoterol as their reliever (with or \nwithout maintenance ICS- formoterol) should take 1 inhalation of their ICS -formoterol reliever whenever needed for \nsymptom relief; for formulations with 3 mcg [2.25 delivered dose] of formoterol per inhalation, 2 inhalations should be \ntaken whenever needed for symptom relief. If necessary, an extra dose can be taken a few minutes later. Additional doses are taken when symptoms recur, even if this is within 4 hours, but the maximum total recommended dose in any single \nday for adults and adolescents (as -needed plus maintenance doses, if used) is 12  inhalations for budesonide- formoterol \n(total 72 mcg formoterol [54 mcg delivered dose]). Based on extensive evidence for efficacy and safety of budesonide-\nformoterol up to this total maximum dose in any day, GINA suggests that the same maximum total dose in a single day should also apply to beclometasone- formoterol. For children, budesonide- formoterol can, if needed, be used up to a total \n(as-needed and maintenance doses, if used) of 8 inhalations in any day. This is the maximum total of as -needed doses \nand maintenance doses, if used. See Box 4-8 (p.84) for specific details.  \nIf the patient is rapidly worsening, or has failed to respond to an increase in as -needed doses of ICS- formoterol over 2 –3 \ndays, they should contact their healthcare provider or seek medical assistance.  \nInhaled combination ICS- SABA reliever  \nFor adults prescribed as -needed combination ICS- SABA reliever with maintenance ICS- containing therapy, the \nrecommended dose is 2 inhalations of budesonide- salbutamol [albuterol] 100/100 mcg metered dose (80/90 mcg \ndelivered dose) as needed, a maximum of 6 times in a day. Overall, in patients on Step 3– 5 therapy, this reduced the risk \nof severe exacerbations by 26% compared with using a SABA reliever, with the greatest benefit seen in patients taking maintenance low -dose ICS -LABA or medium- dose ICS.\n343 There is only one study to date about use of as -needed \ncombination ICS-SABA alone, i.e. , without maintenance ICS or ICS- LABA (see p. 98).324  \nIf the patient is rapidly worsening, or needs  repeated doses of as -needed ICS -SABA reliever over 1–2 days, they should \ncontact their healthcare provider or seek medical assistance.  \nInhaled SABA reliever  \nFor patients prescribed a SABA bronchodilator reliever, repeated dosing provides temporary relief until the cause of the worsening symptoms passes or increased ICS -containing treatment has had time to take effect. However, use of SABA \nreliever is less effective in preventing progression to severe exacerbation requiring OCS than use of low -dose ICS \nformoterol reliever, either with\n224 or without301,302 daily maintenance ICS -containing treatment, or than combination ICS -\nSABA reliever (see Section 4, p. 67).  \nT\nhe need for repeated doses of SABA over more than 1– 2 days signals the need to review, and possibly increase, ICS \ncontaining treatment if this has not already been done.

This regimen was also effective in reducing \nexacerbations in children aged 4– 11 years (Evidence B).410 \nFor adults and adolescents prescribed MART, the recommended maximum total dose of formoterol in 24 hours with \nbudesonide- formoterol is 72 mcg (delivered dose 54 mcg), with extensive evidence from large studies of its safety and \nefficacy up to this frequency in a single day  (as above). Based on this evidence, GINA suggests that the same maximum \ntotal dose in a single day should apply to beclometasone- formoterol (See Box 4-8 , p.84). This approach should not be \nattempted with other combination ICS -LABA medications with a slower -onset LABA  (e.g., ICS-salmeterol) , or that lack the \ndose response and safety profile that is required for a maintenance- and-reliever  regimen.  \nThe benefit of the MART regimen in reducing the risk of severe exacerbations requiring OCS appears to be due to the increase in doses of both the ICS and the formoterol at a very early stage of worsening asthma.\n126-128  \nIn an action plan for patients prescribed maintenance- and-reliever  therapy with ICS -formoterol, the maintenance dose \ndoes not normally need to be increased. Instead, the patient increases their as -needed doses of ICS -formoterol. More \ndetails of medications and doses for different age- groups are available in Box 4-8, p.84. Examples of action plans \ncustomized for MART are available online.313,314 \nOther ICS and ICS -LABA maintenance treatment regimens plus as -needed SABA  \nIn a systematic review, self -management studies in which the ICS dose was at least doubled were associated with \nimproved asthma outcomes and reduced healthcare utilization (Evidence A).521 In placebo- controlled trials, temporarily \ndoubling the dose of ICS was not effective (Evidence A);722 however, the delay before increasing the ICS dose (mean 5– 7 \ndays )719,720 may have contributed. Some studies in adults721 and young children723 have reported that higher ICS doses \nmight help prevent worsening asthma progressing to a severe exacerbation. In a randomized controlled trial in primary \ncare with patients aged ≥16 years, those who quadrupled their ICS dose (to average of 2000 mcg/day beclometasone dipropionate (BDP) equivalent) after their PEF fell were significantly less likely to require OCS.\n724 In an open- label primary \ncare randomized controlled trial of adult and adolescent patients using ICS with or without LABA, early quadrupling of ICS dose (to average 3200 mcg/day BDP equivalent) was associated with a modest reduction in prescribing of OCS.\n725 \nHowever, a double- blind placebo- controlled study in children 5– 11 years with high adherence to low -dose ICS found no \ndifference in the rate of severe exacerbations requiring OCS if maintenance ICS was quintupled (to 1600 mcg BDP equivalent) versus continuing maintenance low -dose therapy.\n726 Given the shape of the ICS dose- response curve, little \nbenefit may be seen from increasing maintenance ICS when background adherence is high, as in this study.  \nIn addition, in several of the studies evaluating ICS increases,719,720, 726 a pre- specified level of deterioration in symptoms (± \nlung function) had to be reached before the extra ICS could be started. This may help to explain the greater reduction in severe exacerbations seen with maintenance- and-reliever  therapy with ICS -formoterol, where there is no lag before the \ndoses of both ICS and formoterol are increased.  \nIn adult with an acute deterioration, high- dos\n e ICS for 7 –14 days (500 –1600 mcg BDP -HFA standard- particle  equivalent) \nhad an equivalent benefit to a short course of OCS (Evidence A).721 For adults taking combination ICS- LABA with as -\nneeded SABA, the ICS dose may be increased by adding a separate ICS inhaler (Evidence D).721,725  \nLeukotriene receptor antagonists  \nIf patients are using a leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) as their only controller, there are no specific studies about \nhow to manage worsening asthma.

Patients should be advised about common side- effects, including sleep disturbance, increased \nappetite, reflux, and mood changes.727 Patients should contact their doctor if they start taking OCS (Evidence D).  \nEven occasional short courses of OCS are associated with significant short -term and cumulative long- term adverse \neffects,225,571 with a pronounced dose response. For all patients, therefore, asthma management should be optimized to \nreduce the risk of further exacerbations requiring OCS (Box X) . This includes optimizing ICS- containing therapy (with a \nswitch for adults and adolescents to Track 1 with ICS -formoterol if available), treating modifiable risk factors and \ncomorbidities, using relevant non- pharmacologic strategies, and providing education and skills training including a written \nasthma action plan (see Section 5, p.108 f or details).  \nBox 9- 3. Optimizing asthma treatment to minimize need for OCS  \nOptimize asthma treatment to minimize cumulative adverse effects of OCS use  \n• OCS can be life- saving during severe asthma exacerbations, but there is increasing awareness of the risks of \nrepeated courses.  \n• In adults, short -term adverse effects of OCS include sleep disturbance, increased appetite, reflux, mood \nchanges,727 sepsis, pneumonia, and thromboembolism.571 \n• In adults, even 4–5 lifetime courses of OCS are associated with a significantly increased dose- dependent risk of \ndiabetes, cataract, heart failure, osteoporosis and several other conditions.225 \n• The need for OCS can be reduced by optimizing asthma therapy, including ICS -containing medications, treating \nmodifiable risk factors, using relevant non- pharmacological strategies, and providing education and skills training, \nincluding inhaler technique and adherence. Refer patients for expert advice if needed (Box 3- 8, p.66). \n• Make sure that all patients are receiving ICS -containing therapy. For adults and adolescents, GINA Track 1 with \nICS-formoterol as anti -inflammatory reliever reduces the risk of severe exacerbations requiring OCS compared with \nusing a SABA reliever (see Box 4- 6, p.77). \n• All patients should have a written asthma action plan, showing them how to increase their inhaled medications and \nwhen to contact medical care.  \nSee p. 11 for abbreviations.  \nReviewing response  \nPatients should see their doctor immediately or go to an acute care unit if their asthma continues to deteriorate despite \nfollowing their written asthma action plan, or if their asthma suddenly worsens.  \nFollow up after a self -managed exacerbation  \nAfter a self -managed exacerbation, patients should see their primary care healthcare provider for a semi -urgent review \n(e.g., within 1 –2 weeks, but preferably before ceasing oral corticosteroids if prescribed), for assessment of symptom \ncontrol and additional risk factors for exacerbations (Box 2- 2, p.37), and to identify the potential cause of the exacerbation. \nCOPYRIGHTED MATERIAL - DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE"

        "text": "168 Treating exacerbations in primary care  \nThe main initial therapies (Box 9 -4, p.167) include repetitive administration of rapid- acting inhaled bronchodilators, early \nintroduction of systemic corticosteroids, and controlled flow oxygen supplementation.716 The aim is to rapidly relieve \nairflow obstruction and hypoxemia, address the underlying inflammatory pathophysiology, and prevent relapse. Infection \ncontrol procedures should be followed.  \nInhaled short -ac ting beta 2 agonists  \nCurrently, inhaled salbutamol (albuterol) is the usual bronchodilator for acute asthma management. For mild to moderate \nexacerbations, repeated administration of inhaled SABA (up to 4– 10 puffs every 20 minutes for the first hour) is an \neffective and efficient way to achieve rapid reversal of airflow limitation (Evidence A).729 After the first hour, the dose of \nSABA required varies from 4–10 puffs every 3 –4 hours up to 6– 10 puffs every 1– 2 hours, or more often. No additional \nSABA is needed if there is a good response to initial treatment (e.g. , PEF >60 –80% of predicted or personal best for 3 –4 \nhours).  \nDelivery of SABA via a pMDI and spacer or a DPI leads to a similar improvement in lung function as delivery via nebulizer (\nEvidence A);  729,730 however, patients with acute severe asthma were not included in these studies. The most cost -\neffective route of delivery is pMDI and spacer,731 provided the patient can use this device. Because of static charge, some \nspacers require pre- washing with detergent before use. The manufacturer’s advice should be followed.  \nCombination ICS -f ormoterol in management of acute asthma exacerbations  \nCombination ICS -formoterol (budesonide- formoterol or beclometasone- formoterol) is now widely used as an anti -\ninflammatory reliever as part of routine asthma management in adults and adolescents, because it reduces the risk of \nsevere exacerbations and exposure to OCS, compared with use of a SABA reliever (GINA Track 1, p.62). Up to a \nmaximum total of 12 inhalations of budesonide- formoterol 200/6 mcg (160/4.5 mcg delivered dose) can be taken in a \nsingle day if needed  (total of as -needed and maintenance doses, if used), based on evidence from large studies of its \nefficacy and safety up to this level of use.224,226 Given this extensive evidence, GINA suggests that the same maximum \ntotal use in a single day should apply to beclometasone- formoterol  (see Box 4-8 , p.84 f or details of medications and \ndoses).  \nIn emergency departments, a randomized controlled trial in adult and adolescent patients with average FEV 1 42–45% \npredicted compared the effect of 2 doses of budesonide- formoterol 400/12 mcg (delivered dose 320/9 mcg) versus 8 \ndoses of salbutamol (albuterol) 100 mcg (delivered dose 90 mcg), with these doses repeated again after 5 minutes; all patients received OCS. Lung function was similar over 3 hours, but pulse rate was higher in the SABA group.\n732 A meta -\nanalysis of earlier RCTs found that the efficacy and safety of formoterol itself was similar to that of salbutamol (albuterol ) in \nmanagement of acute asthma.733 Formoterol is no longer used for this purpose, but there is no evidence that budesonide-\nformoterol would be less effective in management of asthma exacerbations.733 More studies are needed. There are no \npublished data on use of combination ICS -SABA in an emergency department setting.  \nControlled oxygen therapy (if available)  \nO\nxygen therapy should be titrated against pulse oximetry (if available) to maintain oxygen saturation at 93 –95% (94– 98% \nfor children 6– 11 years); note the potential for overestimation of oxygen saturation in people with dark skin color . In \nhospitalized asthma patients, controlled or titrated oxygen therapy is associated with lower mortality and better outcomes than high concentration (100%) oxygen therapy (Evidence A).\n734-737 Oxygen should not be withheld if oximetry is not \navailable, but the patient should be monitored for deterioration, somnolence or fatigue because of the risk of hypercapnia \nand respiratory failure.734-737 If supplemental oxygen is administered, oxygen saturation should be maintained no higher \nthan 96% in adults.738 \nSystemic corticosteroids  \nOCS should be given promptly, especially if the patient is deteriorating, or had already increased their reliever and \nmaintenance ICS- containing medications before presenting (Evidence B).

Patients not currently taking controller medication should \nbe commenced on ICS- containing therapy, as SABA -only treatment of asthma is no longer recommended. An \nexacerbation requiring medical care indicates that the patient is at increased risk of future exacerbations (Box 2- 2, p.37). \nAntibiotics (not recommended)  \nEvidence does not support routine use of antibiotics in the treatment of acute asthma exacerbations unless there is strong \nevidence of lung infection (e.g. , fever and purulent sputum or radiographic evidence of pneumonia).742 \nReviewing response  \nDuring treatment, patients should be closely monitored, and treatment titrated according to their response. Patients who \npresent with signs of a severe or life- threatening exacerbation (Box 9-4 , p.167), who fail to respond to treatment, or who \ncontinue to deteriorate should be transferred immediately to an acute care facility. Patients with little or slow response to \nSABA treatment should be closely monitored.  \nFor many patients, lung function can be monitored after SABA therapy is initiated. Additional treatment should continue \nuntil PEF or FEV 1 reaches a plateau or (ideally) returns to the patient’s previous best. A decision can then be made \nwhether to send the patient home or transfer them to an acute care facility.  \nFollow up  \nDischarge medications should include regular maintenance ICS -containing treatment (see Box 4-8 , p.84 and Box 9-5, \np.170), as -needed reliever medication (low -dose ICS -formoterol, ICS -SABA or SABA) and a short course of OCS. SABA-\nonly treatment is not recommended. Inhaler technique and adherence should be reviewed before discharge. Patients should be advised to use their reliever inhaler only as -needed, rather than routinely. A follow -up appointment should be \narranged for about 2 –7 days later, depending on the clinical and social context.  \nAt the review visit the healthcare provider should assess whether the flare- up has resolved, and whether OCS can be \nceased. They should assess the patient’s level of symptom control and risk factors; explore the potential cause of the exacerbation; and review the written asthma action plan (or provide one if the patient does not already have one). Maintenance ICS- containing treatment can generally be stepped back to pre- exacerbation levels 2– 4 weeks after the \nexacerbation. However, if the exacerbation was preceded by symptoms suggestive of chronically poorly controlled \nasthma, and inhaler technique and adherence are good, a step up in treatment (Box 4-6 , p.77) may be indicated.  \n  \nCOPYRIGHTED MATERIAL - DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE"

If possible, and without unduly delaying treatment, PEF or \nFEV 1 should be recorded before treatment is initiated, although spirometry may not be possible in children with acute \nasthma. Lung function should be monitored at one hour and at intervals until a clear response to treatment has occurred or a plateau is reached.  \nOxygen saturation: this should be closely monitored, preferably by pulse oximetry. In children, oxygen saturation is \nnormally ≥95% when breathing room air at sea level, and saturation <92% is a predictor of the need for hospitalization \n(Evidence C).\n751 Saturation levels <90% in children or adults signal the need for aggressive therapy. Subject to clinical \nurgency, saturation should be assessed before oxygen is commenced, or 5 minutes after oxygen is removed or when saturation stabilizes. Of concern, under conditions of hypoxemia, oxygen saturation may be over -estimated by pulse \noximeters in people with dark skin color.\n728  \nArterial blood gas measurements are not routinely required :752 They should be considered for patients with PEF or \nFEV 1 <50% predicted,753 or for those who do not respond to initial treatment or are deteriorating. Supplemental controlled \noxygen should be continued while blood gases are obtained. During an asthma exacerbation PaCO2 is often below normal (<40 mmHg). Fatigue and somnolence suggest that pCO\n2 may be increasing and airway intervention may be \nneeded. PaO 2<60 mmHg (8 kPa) and normal or increased PaCO 2 (especially >45 mmHg, 6 kPa) indicate respiratory \nfailure.  \nChest X -r ay is not routinely recommended: In adults, chest X -ray should be considered if a complicating or alternative \ncardiopulmonary process is suspected (especially in older patients), or for patients who are not responding to treatment where a pneumothorax may be difficult to diagnose clinically.\n754 Similarly, in children, routine check X -ray is not \nrecommended unless there are physical signs suggestive of pneumothorax, parenchymal disease or an inhaled foreign \nbody. Features associated with positive chest X -ray findings in children include fever, no family history of asthma, and \nlocalized lung examination findings.755 \nCOPYRIGHTED MATERIAL - DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE"

Note the potential for overestimation of saturation in people with dark skin color.728 In severe \nexacerbations, controlled low flow oxygen therapy using pulse oximetry to maintain saturation at 93– 95% is associated \nwith better physiological outcomes than with high concentration (100%) oxygen therapy (Evidence B).734-736 However, \noxygen therapy should not be withheld if pulse oximetry is not available (Evidence D). Once the patient has stabilized, \nconsider weaning them off oxygen using oximetry to guide the need for ongoing oxygen therapy.  \nInhaled short -ac ting beta 2 agonists  \nCurrently, inhaled salbutamol (albuterol) is the usual bronchodilator in acute asthma management. The most cost -effective \nand efficient delivery is by pMDI with a spacer (Evidence A).729,731 Evidence for pMDI and spacer is less robust in severe \nand near -fatal asthma. Systematic reviews of intermittent versus continuous SABA in acute asthma, which mostly used \nnebulized SABA, provide conflicting results. Use of nebulizers can disseminate aerosols and potentially contribute to \nspread of respiratory viral infections.757 \nCurrent evidence does not support the routine use of intravenous beta 2 agonist in most  patients with severe asthma \nexacerbations (Evidence A).758 \nCombination ICS -formoterol as an alternative to high dose SABA  \nCompared with SABA, similar efficacy and safety have been reported from emergency department studies with formoterol,\n733 and in one study with budesonide- formoterol.732 The later  study showed that high- dose budesonide-\nformoterol had similar efficacy and safety profile to high dose SABA.732 In this study, patients received 2 doses of \nbudesonide- formoterol 400/12 mcg (delivered dose 320/9 mcg) or 8 doses of salbutamol (albuterol) 100 mcg (delivered \ndose 90 mcg), repeated once after 5 minutes; all patients received OCS.732 While more studies are needed, meta- analysis \nof data from earlier studies comparing high- dose formoterol with high dose salbutamol (albuterol) for treatment of acute \nasthma in the ED setting suggest that budesonide- formoterol would also be effective.733 Formoterol alone is no longer \nused for this purpose.  \nEpinephrine (for anaphylaxis)  \nI\nntramuscular epinephrine (adrenaline) is indicated in addition to standard therapy for acute asthma associated with \nanaphylaxis and angioedema. It is not routinely indicated for other asthma exacerbations.  \nSystemic corticosteroids  \nSystemic corticosteroids speed resolution of exacerbations and prevent relapse, and in acute care settings should be \nutilized in all but the mildest exacerbations in adults, adolescents and children 6– 11 years.759,760 (Evidence A). Where \npossible, systemic corticosteroids should be administered to the patient within 1 hour of presentation;759 some studies \nshowed similar benefit with high- dose ICS.761 \nUse of systemic corticosteroids is particularly important in the emergency department if:  \n• Initial SABA treatment fails to achieve lasting improvement in symptoms  \n• The exacerbation developed while the patient was taking OCS  \n• The patient has a history of previous exacerbations requiring OCS.  \nRoute of delivery : oral administration is as effective as intravenous. The oral route is preferred because it is quicker, less \ninvasive and less expensive.762,763 For children, a liquid formulation is preferred to tablets.

Evidence does not \ndemonstrate a benefit of intramuscular corticosteroids over oral corticosteroids.760 \nDosage: daily doses of OCS equivalent to 50 mg prednisolone as a single morning dose, or 200 mg hydrocortisone in \ndivided doses, are typically used for adults. For children, a prednisolone dose of 1 –2 mg/kg up to a maximum of 40 \nmg/day is suggested.764 \nDuration : 5- and 7- day courses of prednisone or prednisolone in adults have been found to be as effective as 10- and 14-\nday courses respectively (Evidence B),739,740 and in most children, a 3 –5-day course is usually considered sufficient. \nEvidence from studies in which all patients were taking maintenance ICS after discharge suggests that there is no benefit in tapering the dose of OCS, either in the short term\n765 or over several weeks766 (Evidence B). In adults, a  small number of \nstudies examined oral dexamethasone 12–16 mg given once daily for 1–2 days in children and adults; the relapse rate \nwas similar to that with prednisolone for 3– 5 days, and adverse events rates were similar .744,767,768 In children, a systematic \nreview found no difference in relapse rate with oral dexamethasone 0.3 mg/kg or 0.6 mg/kg once daily for 1– 2 days versus \noral prednisone/prednisolone for 3–5 days; adherence was better, and there was a substantially lower risk of vomiting with \ndexamethasone.769 Oral dexamethasone should not be continued beyond 2 days because of concerns about metabolic \nside-effects. If there is a failure of resolution, or relapse of symptoms, consideration should be given to switching to \nprednisolone.  \nInhaled corticosteroids  \nW\nithin the emergency department: high -dose ICS given within the first hour after presentation reduces the need for \nhospitalization in patients not receiving systemic corticosteroids (Evidence A).761 When added to systemic corticosteroids, \nevidence is conflicting in adults.770 In children, administration of ICS with or without concomitant systemic corticosteroids \nwithin the first hours of attendance to the emergency department might reduce the risk of hospital admission and need for systemic corticosteroids (Evidence B).\n771 Overall, add- on ICS are well tolerated; however, cost may be a significant factor, \nand the agent, dose and duration of treatment with ICS in the management of asthma in the emergency department remain unclear. Patients admitted to hospital for an asthma exacerbation should continue on, or be prescribed, ICS -\ncontaining therapy.  \nOn discharge home :\n  patients should be prescribed ongoing ICS -containing treatment since the occurrence of a severe \nexacerbation is a risk factor for future exacerbations (Evidence B) (Box 2- 2, p.37), and ICS -containing medications \nsignificantly reduce the risk of asthma- related death or hospitalization (Evidence A).329 SABA -only treatment of asthma is \nno longer recommended. For short -term outcomes such as relapse requiring admission, symptoms, and quality of life, a \nsystematic review found no significant differences when ICS were added to systemic corticosteroids after discharge.772 \nThere was some evidence, however, that post -discharge ICS were as effective as systemic corticosteroids for milder \nexacerbations, but the confidence limits were wide (Evidence B).772 Cost may be a significant factor for patients in the use \nof high- dose ICS, and further studies are required to establish their role.772 \nAfter an ED presentation or hospitalization, the preferred ongoing treatment is maintenance- and-reliver therapy (MART) \nwith ICS -formoterol. In patients with a history of ≥1 severe exacerbations, MART reduces the risk of another severe \nexacerbation in the next 12 months by 32% compared with same dose ICS or ICS -LABA plus as -needed SABA, and by \n23% compared with higher dose ICS- LABA plus as -needed SABA.224 See Box  4-8 (p.84) for medications and doses.  \nOther  treatments  \nIpratropium bromide  \nFor adults and children with moderate- severe exacerbations, treatment in the emergency department with both SABA and \nipratropium, a short -acting anticholinergic, was associated with fewer hospitalizations (Evidence A  for adults;773 Evidence \nB for adolescents/children774) and greater improvement in PEF and FEV 1 compared with SABA alone (Evidence A, \nadults/adolescents).773-775 For children hospitalized for acute asthma, no benefits were seen from adding ipratropium to \nSABA, including no reduction in length of stay, but the risk of nausea and tremor was reduced.774 \nCOPYRIGHTED MATERIAL - DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE"

A systematic review identified five studies in adults involving \n206 patients  with acute severe asthma treated with NIV or placebo.787 Two studies found no difference in need for \nendotracheal intubation but one study identified fewer admissions in the NIV group. No deaths were reported in either study. Given the small size of the studies, no recommendation is offered. If NIV is tried, the patient should be monitored \nclosely (Evidence D). It should not be attempted in agitated patients, and patients should not be sedated to receive NIV (Evidence D).  \nSedatives (MUST BE AVOIDED)  \nS\nedation should be strictly avoided during exacerbations of asthma because of the respiratory depressant effect of \nanxiolytic and hypnotic drugs.

The patient’s social circumstances should also be considered.  \nDISCHARGE PLANNING AND FOLLOW -UP \nPrior to discharge from the emergency department or hospital to home, arrangements should be made for a follow -up \nappointment within 2 –7 days (1– 2 days for children), and strategies to improve asthma management including \nmedications, inhaler skills and written asthma action plan, should be addressed (Box  9-5, p.170).418 \nAll patients should be prescribed ongoing ICS -containing treatment to reduce the risk of further exacerbations. For adults \nand adolescents, the preferred regimen after discharge is maintenance- and-reliever therapy (MART) with the anti-\ninflammatory reliever ICS- formoterol, because this will reduce the risk of future severe exacerbations and reduce the need \nfor OCS compared with a regimen with a SABA reliever. In the context of a recent ED visit or hospitalization, it would be appropriate to commence treatment with ICS -formoterol in adults and adolescents at Step 4. For medications and doses, \nsee Box 4-8 (p.84), The maintenance dose can be stepped down later, once the patient has fully recovered and asthma \nhas remained stable for 2 –3 months (see Box 4- 13, p.102).  \nFollow up after emergency department presentation or hospitalization for asthma  \nFollowing discharge, the patient should be reviewed by their healthcare provider regularly over subsequent weeks until \ngood symptom control is achieved and personal best lung function is reached or surpassed. Incentives such as free transport and telephone reminders improve primary care follow up but have shown no effect on long- term outcomes.\n418 \nAt follow -up, again ensure that the patient’s treatment has been optimized to reduce the risk of future exacerbations. \nConsider switching to GINA Track 1 with the anti- inflammatory reliever ICS- formoterol, if not already prescribed.

Diagnosis of asthma in children 5 years and younger  \nKEY POINTS  \nRecurrent wheezing occurs in a large proportion of children 5 years and younger, typically with viral upper respiratory tract \ninfections. It is difficult to discern when this is the initial presentation of asthma.  \nPrevious classifications of wheezing phenotypes (episodic wheeze and multiple- trigger wheeze; or transient wheeze, \npersistent wheeze and late- onset wheeze) do not appear to identify stable phenotypes, and their clinical usefulness is \nuncertain. However, emerging research suggest that more clinically relevant phenotypes will be described and phenotype-\ndirected therapy possible.  \nA diagnosis of asthma in young children with a history of wheezing is more likely if they have:  \n• Wheezing or coughing that occurs with exercise, laughing or crying, or in the absence of an apparent respiratory \ninfection  \n• A history of other allergic disease (eczema or allergic rhinitis), allergen sensitization or asthma in first -degree relatives  \n• Clinical improvement during 2– 3 months of low -dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) treatment plus as -needed short -\nacting beta 2 agonist (SABA) reliever, and worsening after cessation.  \nASTHMA AND WHEEZING IN YOUNG CHILDREN \nAsthma is the most common chronic disease of childhood and the leading cause of childhood morbidity from chronic \ndisease as measured by school absences, emergency department visits and hospitalizations.796 Asthma often begins in \nearly childhood; in up to half of people with asthma, symptoms commence during childhood.797 Onset of asthma is earlier \nin males than females.207,798,799 \nNo intervention has yet been shown to prevent the development of asthma or modify its long- term natural course. Atopy is \npresent in the majority of children with asthma who are over 3 years old, and allergen- specific sensitization (and \nparticularly multiple early -life sensitizations) is one of the most important risk factors for the development of asthma.800 \nViral -induced wheezing  \nRecurrent wheezing occurs in a large proportion of children aged 5 years or younger. It is typically associated with upper respiratory tract infections (URTI), which occur in this age group around 6 –8 times per year.\n801 Some viral infections \n(respiratory syncytial virus and rhinovirus) are associated with recurrent wheeze throughout childhood.802 Wheezing in this \nage group is a highly heterogeneous condition, and not all wheezing indicates asthma. A large proportion of wheezing episodes in young children is virally induced whether the child has asthma or not. Therefore, deciding when wheezing with a respiratory infection is truly an isolated event or represents a recurrent clinical presentation of childhood asthma may be difficult.\n207,803 In children aged under 1 year, bronchiolitis may present with wheeze. It is usually accompanied by other \nchest signs such as crackles on auscultation.  \nWheezing phenotypes  \nIn the past, two main classifications of wheezing (called ‘wheezing phenotypes’) were proposed:  \n• Symptom -based classification :804 this was based on whether the child had only episodic wheeze (wheezing during \ndiscrete time periods, often in association with URTI, with symptoms absent between episodes) or multiple- trigger \nwheeze (episodic wheezing with symptoms also occurring between these episodes, e.g.,  during sleep or with triggers \nsuch as activity, laughing, or crying).  \n• T ime trend -based classification : this system was initially based on retrospective analysis of data from a cohort \nstudy207.

These general patterns have been confirmed in subsequent studies using \nunsupervised statistical approaches.805,806 \nHowever, prospective allocation of individual children to these phenotypes has been challenging in ‘real -life’ clinical \nsituations, and the clinical usefulness of these, and other, classification and asthma prediction systems remain a subject of  \nactive investigation. For example, one study conducted in a research setting with high medication adherence found that daily ICS treatment reduced exacerbations in preschool children characterized as ‘sensitization with indoor pet exposure’ or ‘multiple sensitization with eczema’, but not among those characterized as ‘minimal sensitization’ or ‘sensitization with tobacco smoke exposure’.\n807 \nCLINICAL DIAGNOSIS OF ASTHMA  \nIt may be challenging to make a confident diagnosis of asthma in children 5 years and younger, because episodic respiratory symptoms such as wheezing and cough are also common in children without asthma, particularly in those aged 0– 2 years,\n349,350 and it is not possible to routinely assess airflow limitation or bronchodilator responsiveness in this \nage group.

The frequency and severity of wheezing episodes and the temporal pattern of symptoms (only with viral colds \nor also in response to other triggers) should be considered. Any controller treatment should be viewed as a treatment trial, with follow up scheduled after 2– 3 months to review the response. Review is also important since the pattern of symptoms \ntends to change over time in a large proportion of children.  \nA diagnosis of asthma in young children is therefore based largely on recurrent symptom patterns combined with a careful clinical assessment of family history and physical findings with careful consideration of the differential diagnostic \npossibilities. A positive family history of allergic disorders, or the presence of atopy or allergic sensitization provide \nadditional predictive support, as early allergic sensitization increases the likelihood that a wheezing child will develop persistent asthma.\n800 \nWheeze  \nWheeze is the most common and specific symptom associated with asthma in children 5 years and younger. Wheezing \noccurs in several different patterns, but a wheeze that occurs recurrently, during sleep, or with triggers such as activity, \nlaughing, or crying, is consistent with a diagnosis of asthma. Clinician confirmation is important, as parents/caregivers may  \ndescribe any noisy breathing as ‘wheezing’.812 Some cultures do not have a word for wheeze.  \nWheezing may be interpreted differently based on:  \n•Who observes it (e.g., parent/caregiver versus the healthcare provider)\n•The environmental c ontext (e.g., high income countries versus areas with a high prevalence of parasites that  \ninvolve\n the lung)\n•The cultural context (e.g., the relative importance of certain symptoms can differ between cultures, as can the  \ndiagnos is and treatment of respiratory tract diseases in general).\nCoug\nh \nCough due to asthma is generally non- productive, recurrent and/or persistent, and is usually accompanied by wheezing \nepisodes and breathing difficulties. Allergic rhinitis may be associated with cough in the absence of asthma. A nocturnal \ncough (when the child is asleep) or a cough that occurs with exercise, laughing or crying, in the absence of an apparent \nrespiratory infection, supports a diagnosis of asthma. The common cold and other respiratory illnesses including pertussis are also associated with coughing. Prolonged cough in infancy, and cough without cold symptoms, are associated with later parent/caregiver -reported physician- diagnosed asthma, independent of infant wheeze. Characteristics of cough in \ninfancy may be early markers of asthma susceptibility, particularly among children with maternal asthma.\n813 \nCOPYRIGHTED MATERIAL - DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE"

        "text": "182 Breathlessness  \nParents/caregivers may also use terms such as ‘difficult breathing’, ‘heavy breathing’, or ‘shortness of breath’. \nBreathlessness that occurs during exercise and is recurrent increases the likelihood of the diagnosis of asthma. In infants and toddlers, crying and laughing are equivalent to exercise in older children.  \nActivity and social behavior  \nPhysical activity is an important trigger of asthma symptoms in young children. Young children with poorly controlled asthma often abstain from strenuous play or exercise to avoid symptoms, but many parents/caregivers are unaware of such changes in their children’s lifestyle. Engaging in play is important for a child’s normal social and physical development. For this reason, careful review of the child’s daily activities, including their willingness to walk and play, i s \nimportant when assessing a potential asthma diagnosis in a young child. Parents/caregivers may report irritability, tiredness and mood changes in their child as the main problems when asthma is not well controlled.  \nTESTS TO ASSIST IN DIAGNOSIS  \nWhile no tests specifically and definitively diagnose asthma with certainty, in children 5 years and younger, the following are useful adjuncts.  \nTherapeutic  trial \nA trial of treatment for at least 2– 3 months with as -needed SABA and regular low -dose ICS may provide some guidance \nabout the diagnosis of asthma (Evidence D). Response should be evaluated by symptom control (daytime and night -time), \nand the frequency of wheezing episodes and exacerbations. Marked clinical improvement during treatment, and deterioration when treatment is stopped, support a diagnosis of asthma. Due to the variable nature of asthma in young children, a therapeutic trial may need to be repeat ed to confirm  the diagnosis.  \nTests for allergic sensitization  \nSensitization to allergens can be assessed using either skin prick testing or allergen- specific immunoglobulin E. Allergic \nsensitization is present in the majority of children with asthma once they are over 3 years of age; however, absence of sensitization to common aeroallergens does not rule out a diagnosis of asthma. Allergic sensitization is the best predictor for development of persistent asthma.\n814 \nChest X -ray \nRadiographs are rarely indicated; however, if there is doubt about the diagnosis of asthma in a wheezing or coughing child, a plain chest X -ray may help to exclude structural abnormalities (e.g., congenital lobar emphysema, vascular ring) \nchronic infections such as tuberculosis, an inhaled foreign body, or other diagnoses. Other imaging investigations may be appropriate, depending on the condition being considered.  \nLung function testing  \nDue to the inability of most children 5 years and younger to perform reproducible expiratory maneuvers, lung function testing, bronchial provocation testing, and other physiological tests do not have a major role in the diagnosis of asthma at this age. However, by 5 years of age, many children are capable of performing reproducible spirometry if coached by an experienced technician and with visual incentives.  \nExhaled nitric oxide  \nMeasurement of fractional concentration of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) is not widely available for most children in this age group and currently remains primarily a research tool. FeNO can be measured in young children with tidal breathing, and normal reference values have been published for children aged 1– 5 years.\n815 In preschool children with recurrent \ncoughing and wheezing, an elevated FeNO recorded 4 weeks from any URTI predicted physician- diagnosed asthma at \nschool age,816 and increased the odds for wheezing, asthma and ICS use by school age, independent of clinical history \nand presence of specific IgE.817 \nCOPYRIGHTED MATERIAL - DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE"

Only three prediction tools have been externally validated (Asthma Predictive Index\n818 from Tucson, USA, Prevention and Incidence of Asthma and Mite Allergy (PIAMA) index803 from the \nNetherlands, and Leicester tool819 from the UK), and a systematic review has shown that these tools have poor predictive \naccuracy, with variation in sensitivity and positive predictive value.820 Larger predictive studies using more advanced \nstatistical methods, and with objective measurements for asthma diagnosis, are probably needed to propose a practical tool in clinical care to predict persistent asthma in recurrent wheezers in infancy and preschool age.

Assessment and management of asthma in children 5 years and\nyounger\nKEY POINTS  \n•The goals of asthma management in young children are similar to those in older patients:\noTo achieve best possible control of symptoms and maintain normal activity levels\noTo minimize the risk of asthma flare- ups, impaired lung development and medication side- effects.\n•Wheezing episodes in young children should be treated initially with inhaled short -acting beta 2 agonist ( SABA) ,\nregardless of whether the diagnosis of asthma has been made. However, for initial episodes of wheeze in children <1\nyear in the setting of infectious bronchiolitis, SABAs are generally ineffective.\n•A trial of low -dose inhaled corticosteroid ( ICS) treatment should be given if the symptom pattern suggests asthma,\nalternative diagnoses have been excluded and respiratory symptoms are uncontrolled and/or wheezing episodes are\nfrequent or severe.\n•Response to treatment should be reviewed before deciding whether to continue it. If the response is absent or\nincomplete, reconsider alternative diagnoses.\n•The choice of inhaler device should be based on the child’s age and capability. The preferred device is a pressurized\nmetered- dose inhaler  (pMDI)  and spacer, with face mask for <3 years and mouthpiece for most children aged 3– 5\nyears. Children should be switched from a face mask to mouthpiece as soon as they are able to demonstrate good\ntechnique.\n•Review the need for asthma treatment frequently, as asthma- like symptoms remit in many young children.  Advise\nparents/caregivers that asthma symptoms will often return later in life.\nGOAL OF ASTHMA MANAGEMENT  \nAs with other age groups, the goal of asthma management in young children is to achieve the best possible long- term \nasthma outcomes for the child: \n•To achieve and maintain good long- term control of symptoms and maintain normal activity levels\n•To minimize future risk; that is to reduce the risk of flare- ups, maintain lung function and lung development as close to\nnormal as possible, and minimize medication side- effects.\nMaintaining normal activity levels is particularly important in young children because engaging in play is important for thei r \nnormal social and physical development. Avoiding flare -ups is important not only because of the health concerns, but also \nbecause of the disruption they cause to social and educational progress. It is important to also elicit the goals of the \nparent/caregiver, as these may differ from conventional medical goals.  \nThe long- term goals of asthma management are achieved through a partnership between the parent/caregiver and the \nhealth professional team, with a cycle of:  \n•Assess (diagnosis, symptom control, risk factors, inhaler technique, adherence, parent preference)\n•Adjust treatment (medications, non- pharmacological strategies, and treatment of modifiable risk factors)\n•Review  response including medication effectiveness and side- effects.\nCOPYRIGHTED MATERIAL - DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE"

In young children, as in older \npatients, both symptom control and future risk should be monitored (Evidence D). The rationale for this is described on \np.41.\nAssessing asthma symptom control  \nDefining satisfactory symptom control in children 5 years and younger depends on information derived from family members and careers , who may be unaware either of how often the child has experienced asthma symptoms, or that their \nrespiratory symptoms represent uncontrolled asthma. Few objective measures to assess symptom control have been validated for children <4 years. The Childhood Asthma Control Test can be used for children aged 4 –11 years.\n142 The Test \nfor Respiratory and Asthma Control in Kids (TRACK) is a validated questionnaire for parent/caregiver completion for preschool -aged children with symptoms consistent with asthma; it includes both symptom control and courses of systemic \ncorticosteroids in the previous year.\n146 However, children with no interval symptoms can still be at risk of exacerbations.  \nBox 6 -5 shows a working schema for assessing asthma control in children ≤5 years, based on current expert opinion. It \nincorporates assessment of symptoms; the child’s level of activity and their need for reliever/rescue treatment; and \nassessment of risk factors for adverse outcomes (Evidence D).  There are no validated tools for assessing symptom \ncontrol over longer periods than 1– 4 weeks, but ask the parent/caregiver whether the child’s recent status is usual for \nthem.  \nREMISSION OF CHILDHOOD WHEEZING AND ASTHMA  \nRemission of asthma has been investigated extensively in the past, most commonly remission of childhood asthma off \ntreatment. Definitions and criteria vary, but they commonly refer to either clinical remission  (e.g., no asthma symptoms or \nexacerbations for a specific period) or complete (or pathophysiological) remission  (e.g., also including normal lung \nfunction, airway responsiveness and/or inflammatory markers). There has been interest in remission off treatment , and \nremission on treatment , for example with biologic therapy for severe asthma.204-206 \nThe concept of clinical remission on treatment is consistent with the long-term goal of asthma management  promoted by \nGINA (see p. 50), to achieve the best possible asthma outcomes for the patient. This includes control of symptoms (long-\nterm, not just in recent days/weeks), unimpaired physical activity, improved or stable optimized lung function, prevention of  \nexacerbations (particularly those requiring OCS), avoidance of maintenance OCS, prevention of asthma deaths, and avoidance of adverse effects of asthma medications.  \nReported rates of remission off treatment  from studies in children with wheezing or asthma vary depending on the \npopulations, definitions, and length of follow -up. For example, in one study, 59% of wheezing preschool children had no \nwheezing at 6 years,\n207 whereas in another study, only 15% of children with persistent wheezing at/after 9 years had no \nwheezing at 26 years.208 Clinical remission is more frequent than pathophysiological remission at all ages.209,210 \nThe most important predictors of asthma remission during school years in children with childhood wheezing are fewer, milder or decreasing frequency of symptomatic episodes,\n211-214 good or improving lung function, and less airway \nCOPYRIGHTED MATERIAL - DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE"

However, treatment of asthma in childhood with ICS substantially reduces the burden of asthma on the child and family, reduces absence from school and social events, reduces the risk of exacerbations and hospitalizations, \nand allows the child to participate in normal physical activity.  \nParents/caregivers often ask if their child will grow out of their asthma, and will not need treatment in the future. Current  \nconsensus advice for discussions like these includes:  \n•If the child has no reported symptoms, chec k for evidence of ongoing disease activity, e.g., wheezing;  child avoiding \nphysical activity; lung function if available\n•Use language such as ‘asthma has gone quiet for the present’ to help avoid misunderstandings.

Studies suggest that consideration of factors such as allergic sensitization and/or peripheral blood count may help to \nbetter identify which children are more likely to have a short -term response to ICS.\n826 However, further studies are \nneeded to assess the applicability of these findings in a wider range of settings, particularly in areas where blood \neosinophilia may reflect helminth infection rather than asthma or atopy.  \n• H ow does this individual child differ from other children with asthma, in terms of:  \n- Response to previous treatment  \n- Patient characteristics that contribute to symptoms or risk of flare- ups: e.g. , clinical phenotype, risk factors for \nflare-ups, comorbidities including allergic rhinitis, environmental exposures  \n- Preferences of the parent/caregiver (goals, beliefs and concerns about medications)  \n- Practical issues (cost, inhaler technique and adherence)? \nThe following treatment recommendations for children of 5 years of age or younger are based on the available evidence and on expert opinion.

Generally, treatment includes the daily, long- term use of low -dose ICS \ntreatment to keep asthma well controlled (see Box  11-3 for doses), and reliever medications for as -needed symptom relief. \nThe choice of inhaler device is also an important consideration (Box 11 -4, p.191).  \n  \nCOPYRIGHTED MATERIAL - DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE"

The need for \ncontroller treatment should be re- assessed regularly.  \nBefore considering a step- up of controller treatment  \nIf symptom control is poor and/or exacerbations persist despite 3 months of adequate controller therapy, check the following before any step up in treatment is considered:  \n• Confirm that the symptoms are due to asthma rather than a concomitant or alternative condition (Box  10-4, p.183). \nRefer for expert assessment if the diagnosis is in doubt.  \n• Check and correct inhaler technique.  \n• Confirm good adherence with the prescribed dose.  \n• Consider trial of one of the other treatment options for that step, as many children may respond to one of the options.  \n• Enquire about risk factors such as allergen or tobacco smoke exposure (Box 11 -1, p.188).  \nASTHMA TREATMENT STEPS FOR CHILDREN AGED 5 YEARS AND YOUNGER  \nStep 1: Preferred option: as -needed inhaled short -acting beta 2 agonist (SABA)  \nAll children who experience wheezing episodes should be provided with inhaled SABA for relief of symptoms (Evidence \nD), although it is not effective in all children. See Box 11 -4 (p.191) for choice of inhaler device. Use of SABA for the relief \nof symptoms on average more than twice a week over a 1- month period indicates the need for a trial of low -dose ICS \ntreatment. Initial episodes of wheeze in children <1 year often occur in the setting of infectious bronchiolitis, and this \nshould be managed according to local bronchiolitis guidelines. SABAs are generally ineffective for bronchiolitis.828 \nOther options  \nOral bronchodilator therapy is not recommended due to its slower onset of action and higher rate of side- effects, \ncompared with inhaled SABA (Evidence D).  \nFor children with intermittent viral- induced wheeze and no interval symptoms, particularly those with underlying atopy \n(positive for modified API) in whom inhaled SABA medication is not sufficient, intermittent high- dose ICS may be \nconsidered723,829,830 (see Management of worsening asthma and exacerbations, p. 158), but because of the risk of side-\neffects, this should only be considered if the physician is confident that the treatment will be used appropriately.  \nCOPYRIGHTED MATERIAL - DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE"

        "text": "193 Step 2: Preferred option: regular daily low -dose ICS plus as -needed SABA  \nRegular daily, low -dose ICS (Box 11 -3, p.191) is recommended as the preferred initial treatment to control asthma in \nchildren 5 years and younger (Evidence A).831-833 This initial treatment should be given for at least 3 months to establish its \neffectiveness in achieving good asthma control.  \nOther options  \nI\nn young children with persistent asthma, regular treatment with a leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) modestly \nreduces symptoms and need for oral corticosteroids compared with placebo.834 However, for young children with recurrent \nviral- induced wheezing, a review concluded that neither regular nor intermittent LTRA reduces OCS requiring \nexacerbations (Evidence A).835 A further systematic review found that in preschool children with asthma or recurrent \nwheezing, daily ICS was more effective in improving symptom control and reducing exacerbations than regular LTRA \nmonotherapy.836 Parents/caregivers should be counselled about the potential adverse effects of montelukast on sleep and \nbehavior, and health professionals should consider the benefits and risks of side effects before prescribing.295 \nFor preschool children with asthma characterized by frequent viral -induced wheezing and interval asthma symptoms, as -\nneeded (prn)837 or episodic ICS838 may be considered, but a trial of regular daily low -dose ICS should be undertaken first. \nThe effect on exacerbation risk seems similar for regular daily low -dose and episodic high- dose ICS.833 See also Initial \nhome management of asthma exacerbations  (p.197). \nI\nf good asthma control is not achieved with a given therapy, trials of the alternative Step 2 therapies are recommended \nprior to moving to Step 3.826 \nStep 3: Double the ‘low’ daily ICS dose  plus as -needed SABA . Consider specialist referral  \nIf 3 months of initial therapy with a low -dose ICS fails to control symptoms, or if exacerbations continue to occur, check the \nfollowing before any step up in treatment is considered:  \n• Confirm that the symptoms are due to asthma rather than a concomitant or alternative condition (Box  10-4, p.183).  \n• Check and correct inhaler technique. Consider alternative delivery systems if indicated.  \n• Confirm good adherence with the prescribed dose.  \n• Enquire about risk factors, such as exposure to allergens or tobacco smoke (Box 11-1, p.188).  \nPreferred option: medium- dose ICS (double the ‘low’ daily dose)  \nDoubling the initial low dose of ICS may be the best option (Evidence C). Assess response after 3 months. The child should be referred for expert assessment if symptom control remains poor and/or flare- ups persist, or if side- effects of \ntreatment are observed or suspected.  \nOther options  \nAddition of a LTRA to low -dose ICS may be considered, based on data from older children (Evidence D). The relative cost \nof different treatment options in some countries may be relevant to controller choices for children. Note the concern about potential neuropsychiatric adverse effects with montelukast .\n295 \nNot recommended  \nThere are insufficient data about the efficacy and safety of ICS  in combination with a long- acting beta 2 agonist ( LABA) in \nchildren <4 years old to recommend their use.

In addition, \nreassess and address control of environmental factors where relevant, and reconsider the asthma diagnosis.  \nOther options  \nThe best treatment for this population has not been established. If the diagnosis of asthma has been confirmed, options to consider, with specialist advice, are:  \n• Further increase the dose of ICS for a few weeks until the control of the child’s asthma improves (Evidence D). Monitor for side- effects.  \n• Add LTRA (data based on studies in older children, Evidence D). Benefits, and risks of side effects, should be considered, as described previously; inform the parent/caregiver about the potential risk of neuropsychiatric adverse effects .\n572 \n• Add long- acting beta agonist (LABA) in combination with ICS; data based on studies in children ≥4 years of age.  \n• Add a low dose of oral corticosteroid (for a few weeks only) until asthma control improves (Evidence D); monitor for side-effects.  \n• Add intermittent high- dose ICS at onset of respiratory illnesses to the regular daily ICS if exacerbations are the main \nproblem (Evidence D).  \nThe need for additional controller treatment should be re- evaluated at each visit and maintained for as short a period as \npossible, with consideration of  potential risks and benefits. Treatment goals and their feasibility should be reconsidered \nand discussed with the child’s family/ career . \nREVIEWING RESPONSE AND ADJUSTING TREATMENT  \nAssessment at every visit should include asthma symptom control and risk factors (Box 11 -1, p.188), and side -effects. The \nchild’s height should be measured every year, or more often. Asthma- like symptoms remit in a substantial proportion of \nchildren of 5 years or younger,840-842 so the need for continued controller treatment should be regularly assessed ( e.g., \nevery 3– 6 months) (Evidence D). If therapy is stepped -down or discontinued, schedule a follow -up visit 3 –6 weeks later to \ncheck whether symptoms have recurred, as therapy may need to be stepped- up or reinstituted (Evidence D).  \nMarked seasonal variations may be seen in symptoms and exacerbations in this age- gr oup. For children with seasonal \nsymptoms whose daily long -term controller treatment is to be discontinued (e.g., 4 weeks after their season ends), the \nparent/caregiver should be provided with a written asthma action plan detailing specific signs of worsening asthma, the medications that should be initiated to treat it, and when and how to contact medical care.  \nCHOICE OF INHALER DEVICE  \nInhaled therapy constitutes the cornerstone of asthma treatment in children 5 years and younger. General information about inhaler devices, and the issues that should be considered, are found in Section 5 (p. 108) and in Box 5-1 (p.109). \nThese include, first, choosing the right medication(s) for the child to control symptoms, allow normal activity, and reduce the risk of severe exacerbations; considering which delivery device is available; whether they can use it correctly after training; and, if more than one type of inhaler device is available, their relative environmental impact.  \nFor children aged 5 years and younger, the preferred delivery system is a pressurized metered- dose inhaler (pMDI) with a \nvalved spacer  (Box 11 -4, p.191), with or without a face mask, depending on the child’s age (Evidence A).\n843 This \nrecommendation is based on studies with beta 2 agonists. The spacer device should have documented efficacy in young \nchildren. The dose delivered may vary considerably between spacers, so consider this if changing from one spacer to another.  \nCOPYRIGHTED MATERIAL - DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE"

        "text": "195 The only possible inhalation technique in young children is tidal breathing. The optimal number of breaths required to \nempty the spacer depends on the child’s tidal volume, and the dead space and volume of the spacer. Generally, 5 –10 \nbreaths will be sufficient per actuation.  The way a spacer is used can markedly affect the amount of drug delivered:  \n• Spacer size may affect the amount of drug available for inhalation in a complex way depending on the drug prescribed and the pMDI used. Young children can use spacers of all sizes, but theoretically a lower volume spacer (<350 mL) is advantageous in very young children.  \n• A single pMDI actuation should be delivered at a time, with the inhaler shaken in between. Multiple actuations into the \nspacer before inhalation may markedly reduce the amount of drug inhaled.  \n• Delay between actuating the pMDI into the spacer and inhalation may reduce the amount of drug available. This varies between spacers, but to maximize drug delivery, inhalation should start as soon as possible after actuation. If a \nhealthcare provider or a carer is giving the medication to the child, they should actuate the pMDI only when the child is \nready and the spacer is in the child’s mouth.  \n• If a face mask is used it must be fitted tightly around the child’s mouth and nose, to avoid loss of drug.  \n• Ensure that the valve is moving while the child is breathing through the spacer.  \n• Static charge may accumulate on some plastic spacers, attracting drug particles and reducing lung delivery. This \ncharge can be reduced by washing the spacer with detergent (without rinsing) and allowing it to air dry, but it may re-accumulate over time. Spacers made of anti -static materials or metals are less subject to this problem. If a patient or \nhealthcare provider carries a new plastic spacer for emergency use, it should be regularly washed with detergent \n(e.g., monthly) to reduce static charge.  \n• Nebulizers, the only viable alternative delivery systems in children, are reserved for the minority of children who cannot be taught effective use of a spacer device. If a nebulizer is used for delivery of ICS, it should be used with a mouthpiece to avoid the medication reaching the eyes. If a nebulizer is used, follow local infection control procedures.  \nASTHMA SELF -MANAGEMENT EDUCATION FOR CARERS OF YOUNG CHILDREN  \nAsthma self -management education should be provided to family members and carers of wheezy children 5 years and \nyounger when wheeze is suspected to be caused by asthma. An educational program should contain:  \n• A basic explanation about asthma and the factors that influence it  \n• Training about correct inhalation technique  \n• Information on the importance of the child’s adherence to the prescribed medication regimen  \n• A written asthma action plan.  \nCrucial factors for a successful asthma education program include a partnership between patient/carer and healthcare \nproviders, with a high level of agreement regarding the goals of treatment for the child, and intensive follow -up (Evidence \nD).39 \nWritten asthma action plans  \nAsthma action plans should be provided for the family/carers of all children with asthma, including those aged 5 years and younger (Evidence D). Action plans, developed through collaboration between an asthma educator, the healthcare provider and the family, have been shown to be of value in older children,\n844 although they have not been extensively \nstudied in children of 5 years and younger. A written asthma action plan includes:  \n• A  description of how the parent or caregiver can recognize when symptom control is deteriorating  \n• The medications to administer  \n• When and how to obtain medical care, including telephone numbers of services available for emergencies (e.g., doctors’ offices, emergency departments and hospitals, ambulance services and emergency pharmacies).  \nDetails of treatments that can be initiated at home are provided in Section 12.  \nCOPYRIGHTED MATERIAL - DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE"

Management of worsening asthma and exacerbations in children \n5 years and younger  \nKEY POINTS  \nSymptoms of exacerbation in young children  \n• Early symptoms of exacerbations in young children may include increased symptoms; increased coughing, especially \nat night; lethargy or reduced exercise tolerance; impaired daily activities including feeding; and a poor response to \nreliever medication.  \nHome management in a written asthma action plan  \n• Give a written asthma action plan to parents/caregivers of young children with asthma so they can recognize an \nimpending severe attack, start treatment, and identify when urgent hospital treatment is required.  \n• Initial treatment at home is with inhaled short -acting beta 2 agonist (SABA), with review after 1 hour or earlier.  \n• Parents/caregivers should seek urgent medical care if the child is acutely distressed, lethargic, fails to respond to \ninitial bronchodilator therapy, or is worsening, especially in children <1 year of age.  \n• Medical attention should be sought on the same day if inhaled SABA is needed more often than 3- hourly or for more \nthan 24 hours.  \n• There is no compelling evidence to support parent/caregiver -initiated oral corticosteroids.  \nManagement of exacerbations in primary care or acute care facility  \n• Assess severity of the exacerbation while initiating treatment with SABA (2– 6 puffs every 20 minutes for first hour) and \noxygen (to maintain saturation 94– 98%).  \n• Recommend immediate transfer to hospital if there is no response to inhaled SABA within 1– 2 hours; if the child is \nunable to speak or drink, has a respiratory rate >40/minute or is cyanosed, if resources are lacking in the home, or if \noxygen saturation is <92% on room air.  \n• Consider oral prednisone/prednisolone 1 –2 mg/kg/day for children attending an Emergency Department (ED) or \nadmitted to hospital, up to a maximum of 20 mg/day for children aged 0 –2 years, and 30 mg/day for children aged 3– 5 \nyears, for up to 5 days; or dexamethasone 0.6 mg/kg/day for 2 days. If there is failure of resolution, or relapse of \nsymptoms with dexamethasone, consideration should be given to switching to prednisolone.  \n• Be aware that oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry may be overestimated in people with dark skin color.  \nArrange early follow -up after an exacerbation  \n• Children who have experienced an asthma exacerbation are at risk of further exacerbations. Arrange follow -up within \n1–2 days of an exacerbation and again 1– 2 months later to plan ongoing asthma management.  \nDIAGNOSIS OF EXACERBATIONS  \nA flare -up or exacerbation of asthma in children 5 years and younger is defined as an acute or sub- acute deterioration in \nsymptom control that is sufficient to cause distress or risk to health, and necessitates a visit to a healthcare provider or \nrequires treatment with systemic corticosteroids. In pediatric literature, the term ‘episode’ is commonly used, but \nunderstanding of this term by parents/caregivers is not known.  \nCOPYRIGHTED MATERIAL - DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE"

This combination predicted \naround 70% of exacerbations, with a low false positive rate of 14%. In contrast, no individual symptom was predictive of \nan imminent asthma exacerbation.845 \nUpper respiratory symptoms frequently precede the onset of an asthma exacerbation, indicating the important role of viral \nURTI in precipitating exacerbations in many, although not all, children with asthma. In a randomized controlled trial of acetaminophen versus ibuprofen, given for pain or fever in children with mild persistent asthma, there was no evidence of a difference in the subsequent risk of flare- ups or poor symptom control.\n826 \nINITIAL HOME MANAGEMENT OF ASTHMA EXACERBATIONS  \nInitial management includes an action plan to enable the child’s family members and carers to recognize worsening \nasthma and initiate treatment, recognize when it is severe, identify when urgent hospital treatment is necessary, and \nprovide recommendations for follow up (Evidence D). The action plan should include specific information about medications and dosages and when and how to access medical care.  \nNeed for urgent medical attention  \nParents/caregivers should be advised to seek medical attention immediately if:  \n• The child is acutely distressed  \n• The child’s symptoms are not relieved promptly by inhaled bronchodilator  \n• The period of relief after doses of SABA becomes progressively shorter  \n• A child younger than 1 year requires repeated inhaled SABA over several hours.  \nInitial treatment  at home \nInhaled SABA via a mask  or spacer, and review response  \nThe parent/caregiver should initiate treatment with two puffs of inhaled SABA (200 mcg salbutamol [albuterol] or \nequivalent), given one puff at a time via a spacer device with or without a facemask (Evidence  D). This may be repeated a \nfurther two times at 20- minute intervals, if needed. The child should be observed by the family/carer and, if improving, \nmaintained in a restful and reassuring atmosphere for an hour or more. Medical attention should be sought urgently if any \nof the features listed above apply; or on the same day if more than 6 puffs of inhaled SABA are required for symptom relief within the first 2 hours, or if the child has not recovered after 24 hours.  \nFamily/carer -initiated corticosteroids  \nEvidence to support the initiation of oral corticosteroid (OCS) treatment by family/carers in the home management of \nasthma exacerbations in children is weak ,\n846-850 despite this practice in some regions. Preemptive episodic high- dose \nnebulized ICS may reduce exacerbations in children with intermittent viral triggered wheezing.833 However, because of the \nhigh potential for side- effects, especially if the treatment is continued inappropriately or is given frequently, family -\nadministered high- dose ICS should be considered only where the healthcare provider is confident that the medications will \nbe used appropriately, and the child is closely monitored for side- effects.  \nCOPYRIGHTED MATERIAL - DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE"

Children who fail to respond to 10 puffs of inhaled SABA within a 3– 4 hour period should be referred immediately \nto hospital (Evidence D).  \n• If symptoms resolve rapidly after initial bronchodilator and do not recur for 1– 2 hours : no further treatment may be \nrequired. Further SABA may be given as needed up to every 3– 4 hours (up to a total of 10 puffs/24  hours) . If \nsymptoms persist beyond 1 day, other treatments including inhaled and/or oral corticosteroids are indicated (Evidence D), as outlined below.  \nAdditional treatment  \nWhen treatment in addition to SABA is required for an exacerbation, the options available for children aged 5 years and under  include ICS , a short course of oral corticosteroid, and/or LTRA (see p. 197). However, the clinical benefit of these \ninterventions – particularly on endpoints such as hospitalizations and longer -term outcomes – has not been impressive.  \nParents/caregivers should be informed about the potential for neuropsychiatric adverse effects associated with LTRA.  \nMaintain current controller treatment (if prescribed)  \nChildren who have been prescribed maintenance therapy with ICS, LTRA or both should continue to take the prescribed dose during and after an exacerbation (Evidence D).  As above, parents/caregivers should be informed about  the potential \nneuropsychiatric adverse effects associated with LTRA.  \nInhaled  corticosteroids  \nFor children not previously on ICS, an initial dose of ICS twice the low daily dose indicated in Box 11 -3 (p.191) may be \ngiven and continued for a few weeks or months (Evidence D). Some studies have used high- dose ICS (1600 mcg/day, \npreferably divided into four doses over the day and given for 5– 10 days) as this may reduce the need for \nOCS.\n723,829,830,858, 859 Addition of ICS to standard care (including OCS) does not reduce risk of hospitalization but reduces \nlength of stay and acute asthma scores in children in the emergency department.860 However, the potential for side- effects \nwith high- dose ICS should be considered, especially if used repeatedly, and the child should be monitored closely. For \nthose children already on ICS, doubling the dose was not effective in a small study of mild- moderate exacerbations in \nchildren aged 6– 14 years,861 nor was quintupling the dose in children aged 5 –11 years with good adherence. This \napproach should be reserved mainly for individual cases, and should always involve regular follow -up and monitoring of \nadverse effects (Evidence D).  \nCOPYRIGHTED MATERIAL - DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE"

There is insufficient \nevidence to recommend intramuscular over oral corticosteroids.760 \nRegardless of treatment, the severity of the child’s symptoms must be carefully monitored. The sooner therapy is started in relation to the onset of symptoms, the more likely it is that the impending exacerbation may be clinically attenuated or prevented.  \nDISCHARGE AND FOLLOW -UP AFTER AN EXACERBATION  \nBefore discharge, the condition of the child should be stable (e.g., out of bed and able to eat and drink without problems).  \nChildren who have recently had an asthma exacerbation are at risk of further exacerbations and require follow up. The purpose is to ensure complete recovery, to establish the cause of the exacerbation, and, when necessary, to establish \nappropriate maintenance treatment and adherence (Evidence D).  \nPrior to discharge from the emergency department or hospital, family/carers should receive the following advice and \ninformation (all are Evidence D):  \n• Instruction on recognition of signs of recurrence and worsening of asthma. The factors that precipitated the exacerbation should be identified, and strategies for future avoidance of these factors implemented.  \n• A written, individualized action plan, including details of accessible emergency services  \n• Careful review of inhaler technique  \n• SABAs should be used on an as -needed basis  to avoid masking worsening asthma, but the daily requirement should \nbe recorded to ensure it is being decreased over time to pre- exacerbation levels.  \n• Confirm that ICS has been initiated where appropriate (at twice the low initial dose in Box 11 -3 (p.191) for the first \nmonth after discharge, then adjusted as needed) or continued, for those previously prescribed controller medication.  \n• A supply of SABA and, where applicable, the remainder of the course of oral corticosteroid, ICS or LTRA  \n• A follow -up appointment within 1– 2 days and another within 1–2 months, depending on the clinical, social and \npractical context of the exacerbation.  \n  \nCOPYRIGHTED MATERIAL - DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE"

For children, a ‘window of \nopportunity’ to prevent asthma exists in utero and in early life, but intervention studies are limited.  \nWith regard to  allergen avoidance strategies aimed at preventing asthma in children:  \n• Strategies directed at a single allergen have not been effective in reducing the incidence of asthma  \n• Multifaceted strategies may be effective, but the essential components have not been identified.  \nCurrent recommendations for preventing asthma in children, based on high- quality evidence or consensus  are: \n• Avoid exposure to environmental tobacco smoke during pregnancy and the first year of life.  \n• Encourage vaginal delivery  where possible. \n• Where possible, avoid use of broad- spectrum antibiotics during the first year of life.  \nBreast -feeding is advised, not for prevention of allergy and asthma, but for its other positive health benefits).  \nIn patients with adult -onset asthma, always ask about occupational or domestic exposures, as these exposures may \nexplain 5– 20% of new cases of asthma.  \nIn adults and adolescents, the early identification and elimination of occupational sensitizers and the removal of sensitized \npatients from any further exposure are important aspects of the prevention and management of occupational asthma.  \nFACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED OR DECREASED RISK OF ASTHMA IN CHILDREN  \nAsthma is a heterogeneous disease whose inception and persistence are driven by gene –environment interactions that \nare not yet fully understood. The most important of these interactions may occur in early life and even in utero. There is \nconsensus that a ‘window of opportunity’ exists during pregnancy and early in life when environmental factors may \ninfluence asthma development. Multiple environmental factors, both biological and sociological, may be important in the development of asthma. Data from studies investigating the role of environmental risk factors for the development of asthma support further research on prevention strategies focusing on nutrition, allergens (both inhaled and ingested), pollutants (particularly environmental tobacco smoke), microbes, and psychosocial factors.  \n‘Primary prevention’ refers to preventing the onset of disease.  \nNutrition of mother and baby  \nMaternal diet  \nA large body of research investigating the development of allergy and asthma in children has focused on the mother’s diet during pregnancy. Current evidence does not clearly demonstrate that ingestion of any specific foods during pregnancy \nincreases the risk for asthma. However, a study of a pre- birth cohort observed that maternal intake of foods commonly \nconsidered allergenic (peanut and milk) was associated with a decrease in allergy and asthma in the offspring.\n866 Similar \ndata have been shown in a very large Danish National birth cohort, with an association between ingestion of peanuts, tree \nnuts and/or fish during pregnancy and a decreased risk of asthma in the offspring.867,868 Epidemiological studies and \nrandomized controlled trials on maternal dietary intake of fish or long- chain polyunsaturated fatty acids during pregnancy \nshowed no consistent effects on the risk of wheeze, asthma or atopy in the child.869-872 Dietary changes during pregnancy \nare therefore not recommended for prevention of allergies or asthma.  \nCOPYRIGHTED MATERIAL - DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE"

A \nmeta- analysis873 showed that maternal obesity in pregnancy was associated with higher odds of ever asthma or wheeze \nor current asthma or wheeze; each 1 kg/m2 increase in maternal body -mass index (BMI) was associated with a 2% to 3% \nincrease in the odd of childhood asthma. High gestational weight gain was associated with higher odds of ever asthma or wheeze. However, no recommendations can be made at present, as unguided weight loss in pregnancy should not be encouraged.  \nBreastfeeding  \nD\nespite the existence of many studies reporting a beneficial effect of breastfeeding on asthma prevention, results are \nconflicting,874 and caution should be taken in advising families that breastfeeding will prevent asthma.  Breastfeeding \ndecreases wheezing episodes in early life; however, it may not prevent development of persistent asthma (Evidence D). \nRegardless of any effect on development of asthma, breastfeeding should be encouraged for all of its other positive \nbenefits (Evidence A).  \nTiming of introduction of solids  \nB\neginning in the 1990s, many national pediatric agencies and societies recommended delay of introduction of solid food, \nespecially for children at a high risk for developing allergy. However, meta- analyses have found no evidence that this \npractice reduces the risk of allergic disease (including asthma).875 Early introduction of peanuts may prevent peanut \nallergy in high- risk infants.875 \nDietary supplements for mothers and/or babies \nVitamin D  \nIntake of vitamin D may be through diet, dietary supplementation or sunlight. A systematic review of cohort, case control \nand cross -sectional studies concluded that maternal dietary intake of vitamin D, and of vitamin E was associated with \nlower risk of wheezing illnesses in children.876 This was not confirmed in two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of vitamin \nD supplementation in pregnancy, which compared standard- dose with high- dose vitamin D; however, a significant effect \nwas not disproven.877,878 When the results from these two trials were combined, there was a 25% reduction of risk of \nasthma/recurrent wheeze at ages 0– 3 years.879 The effect was greatest among women who maintained 25(OH)vitamin D \nlevels of at least 30  ng/mL from the time of study entry through delivery, suggesting that sufficient levels of Vitamin D \nduring early pregnancy may be important in decreasing risk for early life wheezing episodes,879 although in both trials, no \neffects of vitamin D supplementation on the development of asthma and recurrent wheeze were evident at the age of 6 \nyears.880 Secondary analysis of the VDAART study878 suggested that earlier supplementation may be more effective in \nreducing the risk of asthma.881 \nFish oil and long- chain polyunsaturated fatty acids  \nSystematic reviews of cohort studies about maternal dietary intake of fish or seafood during pregnancy869,882 and of RCTs \non maternal dietary intake of fish or long- chained polyunsaturated fatty acids during pregnancy869 showed no consistent \neffects on the risk of wheeze, asthma or atopy in the child.

A meta- ana lysis found that studies of interventions focused \non reducing exposure to a single allergen did not significantly affect asthma development, but that multifaceted \ninterventions such as in the Isle of Wight study,896 the Canadian Asthma Primary Prevention Study,897 and the Prevention \nof Asthma in Children study898 were associated with lower risk of asthma diagnosis in children younger than 5 years.899 \nTwo multifaceted studies that followed children beyond 5 years of age demonstrated a significant protective effect both \nbefore and after the age of 5 years.896,900 The Isle of Wight study has shown a continuing positive benefit for early -life \nintervention through to 18 years of age;901 however, it remains unclear which components of the intervention contributed to \nthe effects reported, and the precise mechanism of these effects.  \nTreatment with grass pollen sublingual allergen immunotherapy (SLIT) for 3 years did not reduce the incidence of asthma di\nagnosis (primary outcome) in a large randomized double- blind placebo- controlled trial in children aged 5– 12 years with \ngrass -allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, but asthma symptoms and asthma medication use were reduced. 902 At present, there is \ninsufficient evidence to make a recommendation for SLIT in children with grass allergic rhinoconjunctivitis for the purpose \nof asthma prevention. More  studies are needed.  \nPollutants  \nMaternal smoking during pregnancy is the most direct route of prenatal environmental tobacco smoke exposure.903 A \nmeta- analysis concluded that prenatal smoking had its strongest effect on young children, whereas postnatal maternal \nsmoking appeared only to affect asthma development in older children.904 Exposure to outdoor pollutants, such as living \nnear a main road, is associated with increased risk of asthma.905,906 A 2019 study suggested that up to 4 million new \npediatric asthma cases (13% of the global incidence) may be attributable to exposure to traffic -related air pollution.907 \nPrenatal NO 2, SO2, and PM 10 exposures are associated with an increased risk of asthma in childhood,908 but it is difficult \nto separate effects of prenatal and postnatal exposure.  \nMicrobial effects \nThe ‘hygiene hypothesis’, and the more recently coined ‘microflora hypothesis’ and ‘biodiversity hypothesis’,909 suggest \nthat human interaction with microbiota may be beneficial in preventing asthma. For example, there is a lower risk of asthma among children raised on farms with exposure to stables and consumption of raw farm milk than among children of non- farmers.\n910 The risk of asthma is also reduced in children whose bedrooms have high levels of bacterial -derived \nlipopolysaccharide endotoxin.911,912 Similarly, children in homes with ≥2 dogs or cats are less likely to be allergic than \nthose in homes without dogs or cats.892 Exposure of an infant to the mother’s vaginal microflora through vaginal delivery \nmay also be beneficial; the prevalence of asthma is higher in children born by cesarean section than those born vaginally.\n913,914 This may relate to differences in the infant gut microbiota according to their mode of delivery.915 \nRespiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in infancy is associated with recurrent wheeze at age 5  years.802  Preventative \ntreatment of premature infants with monthly injections of palivizumab, a  monoclonal antibody  prescribed for prophylaxis of \nsevere RSV infection, was  associated with a reduction in recurrent wheezing in the first year of life.916 However, a lthough \nthe risk of parent -reported asthma with infrequent wheeze was reduced at 6 years, there was no impact on doctor -\ndiagnosed asthma or lung function.917 The long- term effect of RSV -specific monoclonal antibodies  in the prevention of \nasthma remains uncertain.918 Studies of RSV vaccination of pregnant women919 and healthy infants920 suggest a reduction \nCOPYRIGHTED MATERIAL - DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE"

However, it has not yet been established whether these \ninterventions  will lead to a reduced risk of further wheezing episodes, or will prevent development of asthma.  \nMedications and other factors  \nAntibiotic use during pregnancy and in infants and toddlers has been associated with the development of asthma later in \nlife,921 although not all studies have shown this association.922 Intake of the analgesic, paracetamol (acetaminophen), may \nbe associated with an increased risk of asthma in both children and adults,923 although exposure during infancy may be \nconfounded by use of paracetamol for respiratory tract infections.923 Frequent use of paracetamol by pregnant women has \nbeen associated with increased risk of asthma in their children.924 \nMaternal folic acid supplementation during pregnancy at higher than recommended doses may be associated with a small \nincrease in the risk of childhood asthma in offspring.925 However, this small risk is far outweighed by the well- established \nrole of folate supplementation in reducing the risk of clinically important  neural tube defects .

Occupational rhinitis may precede asthma by up to a year . Early diagnosis is essential, as \npersistent exposure is associated with worse outcomes.62,63 \nAsthma acquired in the workplace is frequently missed.

An essential screening question is to ask patients whether their symptoms improve when they are away from work (weekends or vacation).\n64 It is important to confirm the diagnosis \nof occupational asthma objectively as it may lead to the patient changing their occupation, which may have legal and socioeconomic implications. Specialist referral is usually necessary, and frequent PEF monitoring at and away from work \nis often used to help confirm the diagnosis.  \nThe early identification and elimination of occupational sensitizers and the removal of sensitized patients from any further \nex\nposure are important aspects of the management of occupational asthma (Evidence A).

Implementing asthma management strategies into health \nsystems  \nKEY POINTS  \n• To improve asthma care and patient outcomes, evidence- based recommendations must not only be developed, but \nalso disseminated and implemented at a national and local level, and integrated into clinical practice.  \n• Recommendations for implementing asthma care strategies are based on many successful programs worldwide.  \n• Implementation requires an evidence- based strategy involving professional groups and stakeholders, and should take \ninto account local cultural and socioeconomic conditions.  \n• Cost-effectiveness of implementation programs should be assessed so a decision can be made to pursue or modify \nthem.  \n• Local adaptation and implementation of asthma care strategies is aided by the use of tools developed for this purpose.  \nINTRODUCTION  \nDue to the exponential increase in medical research publications, practical syntheses are needed to guide policy makers \nand healthcare  professionals in delivering evidence- based care. When asthma care is consistent with evidence- based \nrecommendations, outcomes improve.219,931,932 This Strategy Report is a resource document for healthcare professionals, \nintended to set out the main goals of asthma treatment and the actions required to ensure their fulfilment, as well as to facilitate the achievement of standards for quality asthma care. These objectives can only be realized through local implementation in each country, region and healthcare organization.  \nThe use of rigorous methodologies such as GRADE\n9 for the development of clinical practice recommendations, and of \nADAPTE933 and similar approaches for assisting the adaptation of recommendations for local country and regional \nconditions, has assisted in reducing biased opinion as the basis for asthma programs worldwide. Adaptation of clinical practice recommendations to local conditions using the GRADE method is costly, and often requires expertise that is not available locally; in addition, regular revision is required to remain abreast of developments, including drug availability and new evidence, and this is not easily achieved.\n934 Further, there is generally very limited high quality evidence addressing \nthe many decision nodes in comprehensive clinical practice guidelines, particularly in developing countries.  \nThe GINA annual report is not a formal guideline but an evidence- b ased strategy, updated yearly from a review of the \nevidence published in the last 18 months. Each year’s report is an update on the entire strategy, so it does not use individual PICOT questions and GRADE, but the review process includes systematic reviews using these methodologies. (See section on methodology at www.ginasthma.org ). As with other evidence- bas\n ed clinical recommendations, the GINA \nstrategy must be adapted to the local context for implementation in clinical practice.  \nADAPTING AND IMPLEMENTING ASTHMA CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES  \nImplementation of asthma management strategies may be carried out at a national, regional or local level.935 Ideally, \nimplementation should be a multidisciplinary effort involving many stakeholders, and using cost -effective methods of \nknowledge translation.935-937 Each implementation initiative needs to consider the nature of the local health system and its \nresources, including human resources, infrastructure, and available treatments (Box 14- 1). Moreover, goals and \nimplementation strategies will need to vary from country to country and within countries, based on economics, culture and the physical and social environment. Priority should be given to high- impact interventions.  \nSpecific steps need to be followed before clinical practice recommendations can be embedded into local clinical practice and \nbecome the standard of care, particularly in low resource settings.

Cultural and economic barriers can particularly affect the application of \nrecommendations.  \nBox 14- 3 . Examples of barriers to the implementation of evidence -based recommendations  \nHealthcare  providers  Patients  \n• Insufficient knowledge of recommendations  \n• Lack of agreement with recommendations or \nexpectation that they will be effective  \n• Resistance to change  \n• External barriers (organizational, health policies, financial constraints)  \n• Lack of time and resources  \n• Medico- legal issues  \n• Lack of accurate coding (diagnosis, exacerbations, emergency department and \nhospital admissions, and deaths)  • Low health literacy  \n• Insufficient understanding of asthma and its management  \n• Lack of agreement with recommendations  \n• Cultural and economic barriers  \n• Peer influence  \n• Attitudes, beliefs, preferences, fears and misconceptions  \nExamples of high- impact implementation interventions  \nIdeally, interventions should be applied at the level of both the patient and the healthcare provider and, where relevant, the \nhealth system. Studies of the most effective means of medical education show that it may be difficult to change clinical practice. Examples of highly effective implementation interventions are shown in Box 14- 4. \nBox 14- 4. Examples of high- impact implementation interventions in asthma management \n• Free inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) for patients with a recent hospital admission and/or severe asthma\n941  \n• Early treatment with ICS, guided self -management, reduction in exposure to tobacco smoke, improved access to \nasthma education219 \n• Checklist memory aid for primary care, prompting assessment of asthma control and treatment strategies942 \n• Use of individualized written asthma action plans as part of self -management education521  \n• An evidence- based care process model for acute and chronic pediatric asthma management, implemented at multiple \nhospitals943 \nEvaluation of the implementation process  \nAn important part of the implementation process is to establish a means of evaluating the effectiveness of the program and any improvements in quality of care.  Evaluation involves surveillance of traditional epidemiological parameters, such \nas morbidity and mortality, as well as specific audits of both process and outcome within different sectors of the healthcare \nsystem. Each country should determine its own minimum sets of data to audit health outcomes.  \nHow can GINA help with implementation?  \nThe GINA Strategy Report provides an annually updated summary of evidence relevant to asthma diagnosis, \nmanagement and prevention that may be used in the formulation and adaptation of local guidelines; where evidence is lacking, the report provides approaches for consideration.

ICS \nreduce symptoms, increase lung function, reduce airway hyperresponsiveness, improve quality of life, and reduce the risk of exacerbations, asthma-\nrelated hospitalizations and death. ICS differ \nin their potency and bioavailability, but most of the benefit is seen at low doses (see Box 4- 2, \np.71) for low, medium and high doses of different ICS). Adherence with ICS alone (i.e. , not in \ncombination with a bronchodilator) is usually very poor.  \nAdverse effects  Most patients do not experience side- effects. Local side- effects include oropharyngeal \ncandidiasis and dysphonia; these can be reduced by use of a spacer with pMDIs, and rinsing with water and spitting out after inhalation. Long- term high doses increase the risk of systemic \nside-effects such as osteoporosis, cataract and glaucoma. Concomitant treatment with \ncytochrome P450 inhibitors such as ketoconazole, ritonavir, itraconazole, erythromycin and clarithromycin may increase the risk of ICS adverse effects such as adrenal suppression.  \nICS in combination with a long- acting beta 2 agonist bronchodilator (ICS -LABA)  \nMedications  Beclometasone- formoterol, budesonide- formoterol, fluticasone furoate- vilanterol, fluticasone \npropionate formoterol, fluticasone propionate- salmeterol, mometasone- formoterol and \nmometasone- indacaterol.  \nDelivery  pMDI or DPI  \nAction and use  When a low -dose of ICS alone fails to achieve good control of asthma, the addition of LABA to \nmaintenance ICS improves symptoms, lung function and reduces exacerbations in more patients, more rapidly, than doubling the dose of ICS. Two regimens are available: low -dose \ncombination beclometasone or budesonide with low -dose formoterol for both maintenance- and-\nreliever  treatment (MART, GINA Track 1), and maintenance ICS -LABA with SABA or ICS- SABA \nas reliever (Track 2). MART with low -dose ICS -formoterol reliever is preferred as it reduces \nexacerbations compared with conventional maintenance therapy with SABA as reliever, and is a simpler regimen. For as -needed- only use of ICS -formoterol in mild asthma, see section on anti -\ninflammatory relievers below; and for ICS -LABA- LAMA, see section on add- on medications.  See \nbox 4-2 , p.71 for low, medium and high doses of ICS in combination with LABA. See Box 4-8, \np.84 for medications and doses for anti -inflammatory reliever therapy with ICS -formoterol.  \nAdverse effects  The LABA component may be associated with tachycardia, headache or cramps. LABA is safe for asthma when used in combination with ICS. LABA or LAMA should not be used without ICS in asthma (or in patients with asthma+COPD) due to increased risk of serious adverse \noutcomes.

Even 4– 5 lifetime courses increase cumulative \nrisk of long -term adverse effects e.g. , diabetes, osteoporosis, cataract, glaucoma, heart failure.  \nMaintenance use: consider only as last resort, because of significant adverse effects e.g. , \ncataract, glaucoma, hypertension, diabetes, adrenal suppression osteoporosis. Assess for these \nrisks and treat appropriately.  \nANTI -INFLAMMATORY RELIEVER MEDICATIONS  \nLow-dose combination ICS -formoterol  \nMedications  Beclometasone- formoterol or budesonide- formoterol.  \nDelivery  pMDI or DPI  \nAction and use  This is the anti -inflammatory reliever inhaler for GINA Track 1, for patients prescribed \nmaintenance- and-reliever  therapy (MART) with maintenance ICS-formoterol in Steps 3- 5, or for \npatients prescribed as -needed- only ICS- formoterol in Steps 1- 2. In both settings, it reduces the \nrisk of severe exacerbations compared with using SABA as reliever, with similar symptom \ncontrol. In patients with mild asthma, as -needed- only ICS- formoterol reduces emergency \nvisits/hospitalizations by 65% compared with SABA alone, and by 37% compared with daily ICS \nplus as -needed SABA. See Box 4- 8, p.84 for details of medications and doses for AIR -only and \nMART.  \nLow-dose ICS -formoterol can be taken before exercise to reduce exercise- induced \nbronchoconstriction, and it can be taken before or during allergen exposure to reduce allergic \nresponses.  \nRecommended maximum doses \nin any day  For adults and adolescents, the maximum total number of inhalations in a single day \n(maintenance plus reliever doses) for budesonide- formoterol gives 72 mcg metered dose \n(delivered dose 54 mcg) of the formoterol component. Since the safety and efficacy of budesonide- formoterol up to this maximum total daily use has been established from large \nstudies (>50,000 patients), GINA suggests that the same maximum total daily dose should also apply for beclometasone- formoterol.  \nFor children 6–11 years prescribed MART with budesonide- formoterol, the maximum total dose \nrecommended in a single day gives 48 mcg metered dose (delivered dose 36 mcg) of the formoterol component.  \nSee Box 4- 7, p.78 for details of medications and doses for different age- groups.  \nAdverse effects  As for ICS -formoterol above.  \nLow-dose combination ICS -SABA  \nMedications  Budesonide- salbutamol (also described as albuterol- budesonide); beclometasone- salbutamol .  \nDelivery  pMDI or DPI  \nAction and use  Anti-inflammatory reliever option (instead of SABA) for GINA Track 2. Budesonide- salbutamol \n100/100 mcg (delivered dose 80/90 mcg) taken 2 inhalations as needed for symptom relief on top of maintenance ICS or ICS- LABA reduced the risk of severe exacerbations in adults \ncompared with SABA reliever; most of the benefit was seen in Step 3. ICS -\nSABA cannot be used \nfor maintenance- and-reliever  therapy.  \nNo evidence for as -needed -only use of budesonide- salbutamol in Steps 1 –2. \nCOPYRIGHTED MATERIAL - DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE"

SABAs should be used only as -needed (not regularly) and at the \nlowest dose and frequency required. SABA -only treatment is not recommended because of the \nrisk of severe exacerbations and asthma- related death. Currently, inhaled SABAs are the most \ncommonly used bronchodilator for acute exacerbations requiring urgent primary care visit or ED \npresentation.  \nAdverse effects  Tremor and tachycardia are commonly reported with initial use of SABA. Tolerance develops \nrapidly with even 1 –2 weeks of regular use, with increased airway hyperresponsiveness, \nreduced bronchodilator effect, and increased airway inflammation. Excess use, or poor response \nindicate poor asthma control and risk of exacerbations.  \nDispensing of 3 or more 200- dose canisters per year is associated with increased risk of \nexacerbations, and dispensing of 12 or more canisters per year is associated with markedly increased risk of death.  \nShort -acting antimuscarinics (anticholinergics)  \nMedications  e.g., ipratropium bromide, oxitropium bromide.
