        "text": "FOREWORD BY PRESIDENT OF NATIONAL HEART ASSOCIATION \nOF MALAYSIA (NHAM)\nTHE PUBLICATION of the Clinical Practice Guidelines for Atrial Fibrillation \nmarked a milestone in the evolution of clinical practice guidelines and the delivery of care in cardiology. Specifically, these guidelines assist physicians in clinical decision making by describing a range of generally acceptable approaches \nfor the diagnosis, management, and prevention of AF. Clinical Issues eg: AF \nassessment, best treatment strategy for acute AF & reduce risk of adverse \noutcomes from AF, best long term treatment strategy, management of AF in specific special groups have been addressed in the CPG.\nIn a broader sense, these guidelines emphasized that AF is a worldwide public \nhealth problem with increasing incidence and prevalence, high cost, and poor \noutcomes. Importantly, this AF CPG has provided the framework for a public \nhealth approach to improve the quality of care and outcomes of all individuals with AF. This is a major paradigm shift from the focus on AF treatment and care that has dominated the practice to IMPORTANT STRATEGIES eg: risk stratification, appropriate antithrombotic therapy, safety consideration of antiarrhythmic agents emphasized in rhythm strategy.\nThis latest version has undergone extensive revision in response to comments \nduring the public review. While considerable effort has gone into their preparation over the past 2 years, and every attention has been paid to their detail and scientific rigor, no set of guidelines, no matter how well developed, achieves its purpose unless it is implemented and translated into clinical practice. Implementation is an integral component of the process and accounts for the success of the guidelines. The Work Group is now developing implementation tools essential to the success \nof this AFCPG.\nIn a voluntary and multidisciplinary undertaking of this magnitude, many individuals \nmake contributions to the final product now in your hands. It is impossible to acknowledge them individually here, but to each and every one of them we extend our sincerest appreciation, especially to the members of the Writing Panel, an effort subsequently reinforced by the review of these final guidelines by the \nexternal reviewers. Thank you one and all for Making Lives Better for patients with \nAF throughout Malaysia. A special debt of gratitude is due to the members of the Work Group, their chair, Dr Ahmad Nizar. It is their commitment and dedication that has made it all possible.\nProfessor Dr. Sim Kui Hian FNHAM\nNHAM President\niii"

        "text": "ivABOUT THE GUIDELINE\nGUIDELINE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS\nThis is the first Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) for Atrial Fibrillation (AF). A \ncommittee was appointed by the National Heart Association of Malaysia (NHAM), \nMinistry of Health (MOH) and the Academy of Medicine Malaysia (AMM) to draw up \nthis CPG. It comprises of  sixteen members including cardiologists, a neurologist, a haematologist, a cardiac surgeon, an obstetrician, a gynaecologist, general physicians, an intensivist, a family medicine specialist and an emergency medicine \nspecialist from the government, private sector and the public universities.\nObjectives\nThis CPG is intended to assist health care providers in clinical decision making \nby describing a range of generally acceptable approaches for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of AF.\nRigour of DevelopmentEvidence was obtained by systematic review of current medical literature on Atrial \nFibrillation using the usual search engines – Guidelines International Network (G-I-N), Pubmed/Medline, Cochrane Database of Systemic Reviews (CDSR), Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE), Journal full text via \nOVID search engine, International Health Technology Assessment websites (refer \nto Appendix A for Search Terms). In addition, the reference lists of all retrieved articles were searched to identify relevant studies. Search was limited to literature \npublished in English. All searches were officially conducted between 15 January \n2010 and 10 December 2011. We suggest that future CPG updates will consider evidence published after this cut-off date. The details of the search strategy can \nbe obtained upon request from the CPG secretariat. \nReference was also made to other guidelines on Atrial Fibrillation, Guidelines \nfor the Management of Atrial Fibrillation published by The Task Force for the \nManagement of Atrial Fibrillation of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) \n2010, The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence Atrial Fibrillation Guideline 2006, Evidence-based Best Practice Guideline of New Zealand on Atrial Fibrillation 2005 and the ACC/AHA/ESC Guidelines for the Management \nof Patients With Atrial Fibrillation 2006 were also studied. These CPGs were \nevaluated using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) prior being used as references.\nForty-three clinical questions were developed and divided into eight major sections \nand members of the development panel were assigned individual questions within \nthese subtopics (refer to Appendix B for Clinical Questions). The group members \nmet a total 18 times throughout the development of the guideline. All retrieved literature were appraised by at least two members and subsequently presented for discussion during development group meetings."

        "text": "vAll statements and recommendations formulated were agreed collectively by \nmembers of the Development Panel. Where the evidence was insufficient the \nrecommendations were derived by consensus of the Panel. These CPG are \nbased largely on the findings of systematic reviews, meta-analyses and clinical trials, with local practices taken into consideration.\nOn completion, the draft guidelines was sent for review by external reviewers. It \nwas posted on the Ministry of Health of Malaysia official website for comment and feedback from any interested parties. These guidelines had also been presented to the Technical Advisory Committee for CPG, and the HTA and CPG Council, \nMinistry of Health of Malaysia for review and approval.\nThe level of recommendation and the grading of evidence used in this guideline \nwere adapted from the American Heart Association and the European Society of Cardiology (AHA/ESC) and outlined on page xi. In the text, this is written in black and boxed on the left hand margin.\nSources of Funding\nSanofi Aventis (M) Sdn. Bhd. supported the development of the CPG on \nManagement of Atrial Fibrillation financially. However, the views of the funding \nbody have not influenced the content of the guideline.\nDisclosure statement\nThe development panel members had completed disclosure forms. None held \nshares in pharmaceutical firms or acted as consultants to such firms. (Details are \navailable upon request from the CPG Secretariat)\nClinical Issues Addressed\n1. How do you assess a patient suspected of having atrial fibrillation? \n2. What is the best strategy to treat patients with atrial fibrillation in the acute \nsetting? \n3. What is the best strategy to reduce the risk of adverse outcomes from atrial \nfibrillation? \n4. What is the best long-term management strategy? \n5. How to manage atrial fibrillation in specific special groups?  \nTarget GroupThis CPG is directed at all healthcare providers treating patients with AF – \nallied professionals, family and general physicians, medical officers, emergency physicians, intensivists and cardiologists. \nTarget Population \nIt is developed to assist clinical decision making for all adults and pregnant \nwomen with AF."

        "text": "viPeriod of Validity of the Guidelines\n \nThis guideline needs to be revised at least every 5 years to keep abreast with \nrecent developments and knowledge. \nImplementation of the Guidelines \nTo ensure successful implementation of this CPG we suggest: \n1. Constant checks and feedback on whether the guideline is relevant. \n2. Identify implementation leaders\n Identification of multiple leaders to share the implementation work and ensure \nseamless care. These leaders are likely to be prominent figures who will champion the guideline and inspire others.\n \n3. Identify an implementation group\n Support from medical associations such as the Private Medical Practitioners Society (PMPS), Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology (SOPACE) \nand Malaysian Medical Association (MMA) will help dissemination of the guidelines.\n \n4. Carrying out a baseline assessment \n This involves comparing current practice with the recommendations. The audit criteria will help this baseline assessment.\n5. Developing an action plan\n The baseline assessment will have identified which recommendations are \nnot currently being carried out. These recommendations could be put into an action plan. \n6. Key areas for implementation \n We have identified several goals for implementation based on the key priorities \nfor implementation identified in the guideline"

Any comorbidities that \nmight indicate one approach rather than the other should be taken into \naccount . Irrespective of whether a rate-control or a rhythm-control strategy \nis adopted in patients with persistent or paroxysmal AF, appropriate \nantithrombotic therapy should be used.  \n \n5 When choosing an antiarrhythmic agent for rhythm control strategy, safety \nrather than efficacy considerations should primarily guide the choice of \nantiarrhythmic agent. \n \n6 In patients with permanent AF, who need treatment for rate control, beta-\nblockers or rate-limiting calcium antagonists should be the preferred initial monotherapy in all patients while digoxin should only be considered as monotherapy in predominantly sedentary patients.  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nx"

Paroxysm of AF \nepisodes also occurs in cluster and ”AF burden” can vary markedly over months \nor years.2   \n \n \nFigure 1: Different types of AF. AF = atrial fibrillation;  CV = cardioversion. The arrhythmia tends to progress \nfrom paroxysmal (self-terminating,  usually ,48 h) to persistent [ non-self-terminating or requiring \ncardioversion (CV)], long-standing persistent (lasti ng longer than 1 year) and eventually to permanent \n(accepted) AF. First-onset AF may be the first of  recurrent attacks or alre ady be deemed permanent. \n \nAsymptomatic AF is common even in symptomatic patients, irrespective of \nwhether the initial presentation was persistent or paroxysmal. This has important \nimplications for strategies aimed at preventing AF-related complications.   \n<<Figure 2>> \n \n \n  \n1.4 EPIDEMIOLOGY AND PROGNOSIS \n AF is the commonest sustained cardiac arrhythmia.

The surface ECG is characterized by ‘absolutely’ irregular RR intervals and the absence of any distinct P waves. The P waves are replaced by fibrillary (F) \nwaves. \n \nAtrial Flutter (AFl) in the typical form is characterized by a saw-tooth pattern of \nregular atrial activation called flutter (F) waves on the ECG. AFl commonly \noccurs with 2:1 AV block, resulting in a re gular or irregular vent ricular rate of 120 \nto 160 beats per minute (most characteristically about 150 beats per minute).  1.2 TYPES OF ATRIAL FIBRILLATION \n \nClinically, five types of AF are recognized based on the presentation and the \nduration of the episode. These categories are set out below. (See Table 1 and \nFigure 2)  \n<<Table 1 >> \n \nThe term ‘lone AF’ applies to young individuals (under 60 years of age)\n without \nclinical or echocardiographic evidence of cardiopulmonary disease, including hypertension. These patients have a favourable prognosis with respect to thromboembolism and mortality. \n ‘Silent AF’ being asymptomatic is detected by an opportunistic ECG or may \npresent as an AF-related complication such as ischemic stroke. \n \nThis classi cation is useful for clinical mana gement of AF patients (Figure 1), \nespecially when AF-related symptoms are also considered. \n \n<<Figure 1>> \n \n1.3 AF NATURAL TIME COURSE \n AF is a naturally progressive disease except for a small proportion of patients (2-\n3%), who are free of AF-promoting conditions (see section 2.1.1, page 5), may \nremain in paroxysmal AF over several decades.\n1 AF progresses from short rare \nepisodes, to longer and more frequent at tacks (See Figure 2). With time, often \nyears, many patients will develop sustained forms of AF. Paroxysm of AF \nepisodes also occurs in cluster and ”AF burden” can vary markedly over months \nor years.2"

        "text": "4. MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES  \n 4.1 GENERAL PRINCIPLES \n \nIn patients with AF or AFI, the aims of treatment involve the following five \nobjectives.   \nI  Relief of symptoms, such as palpitations, dizziness, fatigue and dyspnoea, \nis paramount to the patient.  \n \nII. The prevention of serious complications, such as thromboembolism \n(particularly ischaemic stroke) and heart failure, is equally important.  \n \nIII. Optimal management of concomitant cardiovascular disease. \n \nIV. Rate control.  \n \nV. Correction of rhythm disturbance.  \n These goals are not mutually exclusive and may be pursued simultaneously. The initial strategy may differ from the long-term therapeutic goal. \n \nA fundamental question to be answered for every patient with AF or AFI is \nwhether to obtain and maintain sinus rhythm by pharmacological or \nnonpharmacological means (a rhythm-control strategy), or whether to aim \nprimarily to control heart rate rather than  the rhythm (a rate-control strategy).  \n \nFor patients with symptomatic AF lasting many weeks, initial\n therapy may be \nanticoagulation and rate control while the long-term goal is to restore sinus \nrhythm.  \nIf rate control offers inadequate symptomatic relief, restoration of sinus rhythm \nbecomes a clear long-term goal. When cardioversion is contemplated and the \nduration of AF is unknown or exceeds 48  h, anticoagulation will be necessary. \nEarly cardioversion may be necessary if AF causes hypotension or worsening \nheart failure. In contrast, amelioration of symptoms by rate control in older \npatients may steer the clinician away from attempts to restore sinus rhythm. In \nsome circumstances, when the initiating pathophysiology of AF is reversible, as \nfor instance in the setting of thyrotoxicosis or after cardiac surgery, no long-term \ntherapy may be necessary. Regardless of the approach, the need for anticoagulation is based on stroke risk \nand not on whether sinus rhythm is maintained.  \nFor rate and rhythm control, drugs remain the first choice. Radiofrequency \nablation may be considered in symptomatic AF and in lone AF to avoid long-term \ndrug therapy. In selected individuals undergoing cardiac surgery, surgical maze procedure may be a therapeutic option.  \n4.2 THROMBOEMBOLIC PROPHYLAXIS \n \nAntithrombotic therapy must be considered in all patients with AF. Strategies that \nmay reduce thromboembolic risk include the following treatments:  \n \n• Anticoagulants such as Vitamin K Antagonist,  • Antiplatelet agents, such as aspirin and clopidogrel  \n• Intravenous (IV) heparin or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH)  • Left atrial appendage (LAA) occlusion, either surgically or percutaneously.  \n \nThe decision regarding the method of reduction in the risk of stroke, should take \ninto account both the person’s risk of thromboembolism and their risk of bleeding. \nIt is important to remember that vitamin K antagonist such as Warfarin is very effective and reduces the risk of stroke overall by two thirds. (For details see \nSection 6, page 26) \n  \n4.3. HEART RATE CONTROL VERSUS RHYTHM CONTROL \n \nRate control involves the use of chronotropic drugs or electrophysiological or \nsurgical interventions to reduce the rapid heart rate (ventricular rate) often found in patients with AF. Although the atria contin ue to fibrillate with this strategy, it is \nnonetheless thought to be an effective treatment as it improves symptoms and reduces the risk of associated morbidity. However, the persistence of the \narrhythmia continues the risk of stroke and thromboembolic events occurring. \nAdministering antithrombotic drugs reduces this risk. (See Figure 3, page 12)  \nRhythm control involves the use of electrical or pharmacological cardioversion or \nelectrophysiological or surgical interventi ons to convert the arrhythmia associated \nwith AF to normal sinus rhythm. Patients who have been successfully cardioverted are generally administered antiarrhythmic drugs for the long term to help prevent the recurrence of AF. The rhythm control strategies also require the \nappropriate administration of antithrombotic therapy to reduce the risk of stroke \nand thromboembolic events occurring. \n \nRandomized trials comparing outcomes of rhythm versus rate control\n strategies \nin patients with AF are summarized in Table 7 and 8.22-28 \n \n<<Table 7>> \n \n<<Table 8>> 13"

        "text": "The consistent nding in all ve studies was that rhythm control offered no \nsurvival advantage and, in most cases, had little effect on morbidity and quality of \nlife. However, it should be emphasised that these conclusions are not necessarily \napplicable to all groups of patients. The ve recent studies enrolled mostly older \npatients with additional risk factors for stroke, many of whom also had heart \nfailure. Younger patients with normal hearts and primarily paroxysmal atrial \nbrillation (PAF) were not well represented. Importantly, in a prede ned subgroup \nof AFFIRM participants aged less than 65 years, hazard ratios for death showed \na paradoxical trend towards superiority of the rhythm-control strategy.  \n \nThe initial therapy after onset of AF should always include adequate \nantithrombotic treatment and control of the ventricular rate. If the ultimate goal is \nrestoration and maintenance of sinus rhythm, rate control medication should be \ncontinued throughout follow-up, unless continuous sinus rhythm is present. The \ngoal is to control the ventricular rate adequately whenever recurrent AF occurs.  \n \nThe decision to add rhythm control therapy to the management of AF requires an individual decision and should therefore be discussed at the beginning of AF \nmanagement. Before choosing rate control alone as a long-term strategy, the \nclinician should consider how permanent AF is likely to affect the individual patient in the future and how successful rhythm control is expected to be (Figure \n3, page 12).

At \nleast 3 h of ECG and haemodynamic monitoring are needed after the procedure, \nbefore the patient is allowed to leave the hospital.  \n \nInternal cardioversion may be helpful in special situations, e.g. when a patient undergoes invasive procedures and cardioversion catheters can be placed \nwithout further vascular access and when implanted de brillation devices are \npresent.  \n \n5.1.3.2 Complications  \n \nThe risks and complications of cardioversion are associated primarily with \nx Thrombo-embolic events,  \nx Post-cardioversion arrhythmias, and  x The risks of general anesthesia.  \n \nThe procedure is associated with 1 – 2% risk of thromboembolism, which can be \nreduced by adequate anticoagulation in the weeks prior to cardioversion or by \nexclusion of left atrium thrombi before the procedure. Skin burns are a common \ncomplication. In patients with sinus node dysfunction, especially in elderly \npatients with structural heart disease, prolonged sinus arrest without an adequate \nescape rhythm may occur. Dangerous arrhythmias, such as ventricular \ntachycardia and brillation, may arise in the presence of hypokalaemia, digitalis \nintoxication, or improper synchronization. The patient may become hypoxic or \nhypoventilate from sedation, but hypotension and pulmonary oedema are rare.  \n \n5.1.3.3 Cardioversion in patients with implanted pacemakers and \ndebrillators  \n \nThe electrode paddle should be at least 8 cm from the pacemaker battery, and \nthe antero-posterior paddle positioning is recommended. Biphasic shocks are \npreferred because they require less energy for AF termination. In pacemaker-\ndependent patients, an increase in pacing threshold should be anticipated. In the \nabsence of a pacemaker programmer, a pacing magnet may be placed over the pacemaker generator pocket to provide temporary pacing support. These \npatients should be monitored carefully. After cardioversion, the device should be \ninterrogated and evaluated to ensure normal function.   \n5.1.3.4 Recurrence after cardioversion  \n \nRecurrences after DCCV can be divided into three phases:  \n(1) Immediate recurrences, which occur within the rst few minutes after DCCV.  \n(2) Early recurrences, which occur during the rst 5 days after DCCV.

When data from all comparisons of \nantiplatelet agents and placebo or control groups were included in the meta-\nanalysis, antiplatelet therapy reduced stroke by 22%.\n55   \n  \nThe magnitude of stroke reduction from aspirin vs. placebo in the meta-analysis \nis broadly similar to that seen when aspirin is given to vascular disease subjects. \nGiven that AF commonly co-exists with vascular disease, the modest bene t \nseen for aspirin in AF is likely to be related to its effects on vascular disease. \n \nIn the Japan Atrial Fibr illation Stroke Trial,69 patients with lone AF were \nrandomized to an aspirin group (aspirin at 150 – 200 mg/day) or a placebo control group. The primary outcomes of cardiovascular death and non fatal \nstroke or TIA was 3.1% per year in the aspirin group and was worse than those \nin the control group, 2.4% per year, and treatment with aspirin caused a non-\nsignicant increased risk of major bleeding (1.6%) compared with control (0.4%).   \n \nThe Birmingham Atrial Fibrillation Treatment of the Aged (BAFTA) study also \nshowed that VKA (target INR 2 – 3) was superior to aspirin 75 mg daily in \nreducing the primary endpoint of fata l or disabling stroke, intracranial \nhemorrhage, or thromboembolism by 52%, with no difference in the risk of major \nhemorrhage between VKA and aspirin.68  \n \n increment with values between 2.0 and 3.0 compared with lower INR levels.

There was an absolute \nrisk reduction of 0.8% per year for primary prevention trials and 2.5% per year for \nsecondary prevention by using aspirin. When data from all comparisons of \nantiplatelet agents and placebo or control groups were included in the meta-\nanalysis, antiplatelet therapy reduced stroke by 22%.55   \n  \nThe magnitude of stroke reduction from aspirin vs. placebo in the meta-analysis \nis broadly similar to that seen when aspirin is given to vascular disease subjects. \nGiven that AF commonly co-exists with vascular disease, the modest bene t \nseen for aspirin in AF is likely to be related to its effects on vascular disease. \n \nIn the Japan Atrial Fibr illation Stroke Trial,69 patients with lone AF were \nrandomized to an aspirin group (aspirin at 150 – 200 mg/day) or a placebo control group. The primary outcomes of cardiovascular death and non fatal stroke or TIA was 3.1% per year in the aspirin group and was worse than those \nin the control group, 2.4% per year, and treatment with aspirin caused a non-\nsignicant increased risk of major bleeding (1.6%) compared with control (0.4%).   \n \nThe Birmingham Atrial Fibrillation Treatment of the Aged (BAFTA) study also \nshowed that VKA (target INR 2 – 3) was superior to aspirin 75 mg daily in \nreducing the primary endpoint of fata l or disabling stroke, intracranial \nhemorrhage, or thromboembolism by 52%, with no difference in the risk of major \nhemorrhage between VKA and aspirin.\n68  \n  \n34"

Extensive and frequently \nrepeated ablation procedures may be necessary in these patients, and it seems reasonable to recommend that they should be refractory to antiarrhythmic drug \ntreatment before ablation is considered (See Figure 14). \n \n<<Figure 14>> \n For symptomatic paroxysmal and persistent AF in patients with relevant organic \nheart disease, antiarrhythmic drug treatment is recommended before catheter \nablation. In such patients, successful ablation is more difficult to achieve. Major \nsymptoms should be associated with the arrhythmia to justify the procedure. \nAblation of persistent and long-standing persistent AF is associated with variable \nbut encouraging success rates, but very  often requires several attempts.  \n \nAblation of common atrial utter is recommended as part of an AF ablation \nprocedure if documented prior to the abla tion procedure or occurring during the \nAF ablation.\n18  I B \n \nCatheter ablation for paroxysmal AF should be considered in symptomatic IIa A  \n8.2.2.1 Patients with left ventricular hypertrophy  \n In patients with LV hypertrophy, sotalol is thought to be associated with an \nincreased incidence of proarrhythmia.

        "text": "9 MANAGEMENT – SPECIAL POPULATIONS  \n \n 9.1 POST-OPERATIVE AF \n \nAlthough AF may occur after noncardiac surgery, the incidence of atrial \narrhythmias including AF after open-heart surgery is between 20% and 50%.  \nPost-operative AF usually occurs within 5 d of open-heart surgery, with a peak incidence on the second day. The arrhythmia is usually self-correcting, and sinus \nrhythm resumes in more than 90% of patients by 6 to 8 wk after surgery.\n \n \nA systematic review of 58 studies in 8565  patients has shown that interventions \nto prevent and/or treat post-operative AF with ß-blockers, sotalol, or amiodarone and, less convincingly, atrial pacing, are favoured with respect to outcome.\n153   \n \n9.1.1 PREVENTION OF POST-OPERATIVE ATRIAL FIBRILLATION  \nß-Blocker  therapy is most effective when provided both before and after cardiac \nsurgery compared with only before or after surgery.\n153-155 Withdrawal of ß-\nblockers is a signi cant risk factor for the development of post-operative AF and \nshould be avoided. Treatment should be started at least 1 week before surgery \nwith a ß-blocker without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity.  \nProphylactic amiodarone  decreased the incidence of post- operative AF\n156. The \nbenecial effect of amiodarone has been consistently demonstrated in a systematic review.153The adverse effects of perioperative prophylactic i.v. \namiodarone include an increased probability of post-operative bradycardia and \nhypotension.153  \n Sotalol  has been reported to reduce the incidence of post-operative AF by 64% \ncompared with placebo.153 However, the use of sotalol places patients at risk of \nbradycardia and torsade de pointes, especially those with electrolyte disturbances, and its use in post-operative AF is limited. \n \nMeta-analyses demonstrated that corticosteroid  therapy was associated with a \n26 – 45% reduction in post-operative AF and shorter hospital stay.\n157 However, \nthe potential adverse effects on glucose metabolism, wound healing, and \ninfection, make their use for prevention of AF as controversial.   \nOne meta-analysis of eight trials has shown that prophylactic atrial pacing  \nreduced the incidence of post-operative AF regardless of the atrial pacing site or \npacing algorithm used. 153 \n 9.1.2 TREATMENT OF POST-OPERATIVE ATRIAL FIBRILLATION  \n In haemodynamically stable patients, the majority will convert spontaneously to \nsinus rhythm within 24 h. Initial managem ent includes correction of predisposing \nfactors (such as pain management, haemodynamic optimization, weaning of i.v. \ninotropes, correcting electrolytes and metabolic abnormalities, and addressing  \nanaemia or hypoxia) where possible.158  \n \nIn the highly symptomatic patient or when rate control is difficult to achieve, \ncardioversion may be performed. DCCV is 95% successful but pharmacological \ncardioversion is more commonly used. Amiodarone was shown to be more \neffective than placebo in converting post-operative AF to sinus rhythm.   \nShort-acting ß-blockers (e.g. esmolol) are particularly useful when \nhaemodynamic instability is a concern. Other atrioventricular nodal blocking agents, such as non-dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists, can be used \nas alternatives, but digoxin is less effective when adrenergic tone is high. The \nagents used for rate control of AF following cardiac surgery are listed in Table 15.  \n \nA number of studies have shown an increased risk of stroke in patients after cardiac surgery. Anticoagulation with heparin or VKA is appropriate when AF \npersists longer than 48 h.\n159 Standard precautions regarding anticoagulation \npericardioversion should be used (see Section 4.3).   \n Oral ȕ-blockers are recommended to prevent post-operative AF for patients \nundergoing cardiac surgery in the absence of contraindications.\n153,154  I A \n \nIf used, ȕ-blockers (or other oral antiarrhythmic drugs for AF management) are \nrecommended to be continued until the day of surgery.154,155  I B \n Restoration of sinus rhythm by DCCV is recommended in patients who develop \npost-operative AF and are haemodynamically unstable.

This \nmakes AF in this patient cohort a pote ntially life-threatening arrhythmia. For \ninformation relating to acute and long-term pharmacological rate control in patients with an AP, see Section 5.1.1, page 18.  \n \n9.3.1 SUDDEN DEATH AND RISK STRATIFICATION   \nThe incidence of SCD in patients with the Wolff – Parkinson – White syndrome \nhas ranged from 0.15 to 0.39% over 3- to 22-year follow-up.   \nThe markers of increased risk are:  \nx Shortest pre-excited RR interval <250 ms during spontaneous or induced \nAF.  \nx A history of symptomatic tachycardia. \nx The presence of multiple APs. \nx Ebstein’s anomaly.  \n \nSince the efficacy of catheter ablation of APs is 95%, this is the management of \nchoice for patients with evidence pre-excitation and AF.\n16 Patients who have \nsurvived SCD in the presence of an overt AP should have urgent AP ablation. \nSuccessful catheter ablation in those patients eliminates the risk for SCD.  \n \nPatients with overt pre-excitation and high risk of AF, or patients with high-risk \nprofessions such as public transport vehicle drivers, pilots, or competitive \nathletes should be considered for ablation.   \nThe indication for catheter ablation of an overt AP in an asymptomatic patient is \nstill controversial (especially in children).165 Most patients with asymptomatic pre-\nexcitation have a good prognosis; SCD is rarely the rst manifestation of the \ndisease.   \nThe positive predictive value of invasive electrophysiological testing is \nconsidered to be too low to justify routine use in asymptomatic patients. Catheter \nablation of an asymptomatic overt AP should remain a case-by-case decision \nwith detailed counseling of the patient (and family) about the natural course and \nthe risk of SCD versus the risk of an ablation procedure.

REFERRALS \n \n10.1 Acute hospitalisation/referral  \nThis is required for patients with:  \nx AF/AFL with haemodynamic compromise, acute dyspnoea, acute heart \nfailure, chest pain, ischaemia, near syncope, hypotension  \nx AF/AFL with rapid uncontrolled heart rate, e.g., over 140 bpm at rest  x AF/AFL with acute systemic illness requiring acute management  x rst/new onset of AF/AFL symptoms, no contraindications to cardioversion, \nwith the possibility of cardioversion within 48 hours of onset.  \n \n10.2 Outpatient specialist physician/cardiologist   \nOutpatient specialist referral is recommended for those who:  \nx Need further investigation/echocardiography  x Have suspected structural heart disease (e.g., hypertensive, valvular, \nischaemic)  \nx Are to be considered for cardioversion  \nx Are highly symptomatic, requiring ‘maintenance of sinus rhythm’ \nantiarrhythmic therapy  \nx Are having difficulty with pharmacological rate control  \nx Require a second opinion of the risk/bene t ratio of anticoagulation  \nx Are having syncopal attacks.  \n \n10.3 Cardiac electrophysiologist (heart-rhythm specialist)   \nTertiary referral is recommended for patients who have:  \nx AF with WPW syndrome  (pre-excited AF)  \nx Highly-symptomatic AF unresponsive to rst-line antiarrhythmic treatment  \nx Uncontrolled ventricular rate with maximally tolerated atrioventricular-\nblocking therapy  \nx Recurrent AFL (including mixed AFL and AF where AFL is the dominant \narrhythmia)  \nx Tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome (sinus node dysfunction)  x Suspicion or documentation of a regular tachycardia triggering AF (e.g., \nSVT).  \n \n10.4 No referral  \nReferral is not needed for patients who have rate-controlled AF with mild or \noccasional symptoms, for whom echocardiography is not required (e.g., previously obtained), and for whom the decision regarding stroke prevention \nmanagement is clear cut.  \n   \n  \n  \nWhen a ‘pill-in-the-pocket’ approach with sodium channel blockers is used, sport \ncessation should be considered for as long as the arrhythmia persists, and until 1–2 half-lives of the antiarrhythmic drug used have elapsed. IIa C \n Isthmus ablation should be considered in co mpetitive or leisure-time athletes with \ndocumented atrial utter, especially when therapy with ecainide or propafenone \nis intended. IIa C \n \nWher e appropriate, AF ablation should be considered to prevent recurrent AF in \nathletes. IIa C \n \nWhen a speci c cause for AF is identi ed in an athlete (such as \nhyperthyroidism), it is not recommended to  continue participation in competitive \nor leisure time sports until correction of the cause. III C \n \nIt is not re commended to allow physical sports activity when symptoms due to \nhaemodynamic impairment (such as dizziness) are present. III C \n \n \n9.10 VALVULAR HEART DISEASE  \n \nAF frequently accompanies valvular heart disease. LA distension is an early \nmanifestation of progressive mitral valve disease, and the presence of \nparoxysmal or permanent AF is an accepted indication for early percutaneous or \nsurgical mitral intervention.66 AF is also frequently seen in later stages of aortic \nvalve disease when LV dilatation and elevated end-diastolic pressure exert \nsecondary effects on LA function.  \n \nManagement of AF follows conventional recommendations in the setting of \nvalvular heart disease, although a rate control strategy is usually adopted because of the low likelihood of maintaining sinus rhythm in the long term.  \n \nPrincipal concerns surround the high risk of thrombo-embolism in subjects with \nvalvular heart disease, and a low threshold for anticoagulation is recommended  \n(See Section 6.1).  \n \n \nOAC therapy (INR 2.0–3.0) is indicated in patients with mitral stenosis and AF \n(paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent).  I C \n \nOAC therapy (INR 2.0–3.0) is recommended in patients with AF and clinically \nsignicant mitral regurgitation. I C \n Percutaneous mitral balloon valvotomy should be considered for asymptomatic \npatients with moderate or severe mitral stenosis and suitable valve anatomy who have new-onset AF in the absence of LA thrombus.
