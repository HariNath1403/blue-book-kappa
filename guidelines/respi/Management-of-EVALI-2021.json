There was active involvement from \na multidisciplinary Review Committee (RC) during the process of the \nCPG development.\nThis is the first edition of an evidence-based CPG on the Management \nof E-Cigarette or Vaping Product Use-Associated Lung Injury (EVALI). \nLiterature search was carried out using the following electronic \ndatabases: mainly Medline via Ovid and Cochrane Database of \nSystemic Reviews and others e.g. Pubmed and Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention (refer to Appendix 1 for Example of Search \nStrategy). The search was limited to literature published on humans and \nin English. In addition, the reference lists of all retrieved literature and \nguidelines were searched to further identify relevant studies. Experts \nin the field were also contacted to identify further studies. All searches \nwere conducted from 27 August 2020 to 1 September 2020. Literature \nsearches were repeated for all clinical questions at the end of the CPG \ndevelopment process, allowing any relevant papers published before \n28 February 2021 to be included. Future CPG updates will consider \nevidence published after this cut-off date. The details of the search \nstrategy can be obtained upon request from the CPG Secretariat.\nThere was no relevant evidence-based CPG used as a reference in \ndeveloping the MoH CPG on EVALI. A total of seven clinical questions \nwere developed under three sections (diagnosis, treatment and referral/\nfollow-up). Members of the DG were assigned individual questions \nwithin the sections (refer to Appendix 2 for Clinical Questions). \nThe DG members met 12 times throughout the development of these \nguidelines. All literature retrieved were appraised by at least two DG \nmembers using Critical Appraisal Skill Programme checklist when \napplicable, presented in evidence tables and further discussed in \nDG meetings. All statements and recommendations subsequently \nformulated were agreed upon by both the DG and RC. Where evidence \nwas insufficient, the recommendations were made by consensus of the \nDG and RC. There were only a few published articles on EVALI and all \nwere of low level evidence. This CPG was developed largely based on \nthe findings of reviews and observational studies, with local practices \ntaken into consideration.\nThe literature used in these guidelines were graded using the US/\nCanadian Preventive Services Task Force Level of Evidence (2001), \nwhile the grading of recommendation was done using the principles of \niii"

In the setting of a normal CXR in a high \nclinical suspicion of EVALI, a CT scan should be performed to better \nassess for lung injury.\nIn a cross-sectional study involving 98 patients from Illinois and \nWisconsin, chest imaging findings were positive in all cases of EVALI. \nThese were based on either CXR or CT scan.11, level III\nFindings in CXR of EVALI patients include ground-glass opacities \nand consolidation which are usually bilateral and almost symmetric in \ndistribution.22, level III The abnormalities are lower lobe predominant or \ndiffuse in most cases with sparing of the heart border and subpleural \nregion. Septal thickening manifesting as Kerley B lines can also be \nseen.23, level III\nImaging findings of EVALI are better seen on CT scan compared with \nCXR.

The AEP-like \npattern has findings that overlap with the OP and DAD pattern but is \nassociated with pronounced smooth interlobular septal thickening and \npleural effusions secondary to increased vascular permeability.24, level III\nMild and symmetrical hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy are \ncommon findings of EVALI.16, level III; 24, level III However, necrotic or calcified \nlymphadenopathy is not a feature.

Based \non current evidence, there is no specific bronchoscopic findings that \ncan confirm the diagnosis of EVALI. Bronchoscopy may be performed \nto exclude specific suspected alternative diagnosis where non-invasive \nmethods are inadequate. It should be guided by clinical pre-test \nprobabilities of the EVALI.15, level III\nSeveral observational studies showed predominance of macrophages \nand neutrophils, and scant eosinophils in cytology of bronchoalveolar \nlavage (BAL) in EVALI patients. Lipid-laden macrophages (LLMs) in \nBAL had been reported in most EVALI patients as well as asymptomatic \npersons who were e-cig users. Although LLMs were not specific for \nEVALI, their absence should prompt reconsideration of diagnosis. A \ndiverse patterns of diffuse lung injury and inflammation were seen in \nhistopathology examination of lung biopsy of EVALI patients, but none \nwere pathognomonic. Thus, cytology and histopathology examination \nof lung biopsy specimens from bronchoscopy were nonspecific and \ncould not confirm the diagnosis of EVALI.15, level III\nFindings of vitamin E acetate in BAL provided direct evidence of its \nexistence at the primary site of injury among EVALI patients.25, level III"

AETIOLOGY/CHEMICAL PROFILING\nE-cig is a device that produces an aerosol by heating a liquid which \ncontains a solvent in one or more flavourings, with or without nicotine \n(also known as e-liquid). It is composed of an atomiser that uses \nelectrical current from a battery to heat a metal coil. This aerosolises \nan e-liquid, which is conducted from a reservoir to the coil by a wick. \nAerosol from e-cig may contain different chemical composition subject \nto device type, voltage used and e-liquid content.18, level III\nGenerally, e-liquid constitutes varying ratios of vegetable glycerin (VG), \npropylene glycol (PG), nicotine, and flavouring agents. However, some \nstudies detected more than 60 compounds in e-liquid, this includes \nchemicals which is not stated by the manufacturer.27, level III As e-cig \nmetal components undergo repeated cycles of heating and cooling, \ntraces of toxic metal can leach into the e-liquid and emitted through \ne-cig aerosol.27 - 28, level III\nChemicals in e-liquid (e.g. PG and VG) and flavouring agent are \nconsidered to be “generally recognised as safe (GRAS)” by United \nStates Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for oral consumption but \nnot through inhalation. They will be converted to toxicant when heated \nduring e-cig smoking.28, level III\nRecent evidence showed that vitamin E acetate had been detected in \na high proportion of THC-containing products associated with EVALI \ncases.29, level III\nContribution of chemicals of concerns in EVALI cases has been \nstudied. These include chemicals in either THC- or non-THC-containing \nproducts. Thus, chemical profiling is important for ongoing surveillance \nof the potential toxicants that can be associated with EVALI. \nIn a nationwide study of hospitalised EVALI patients in USA, the self-\nreported substance use in e-cig were 53% on both THC- and nicotine-\ncontaining product, 33% exclusive THC-containing product and 14% \nexclusive nicotine-containing product.30, level III\nA small study on EVALI patients in Minnesota tested selected products \nbecause of available product volume and features that physically \ndifferentiated the cartridges showed that vitamin E acetate was the \nmost common compound detected in THC-containing product. Issues \nfaced in doing chemical profiling in the study include:29, level III\n• poor cooperation of the patients in providing product for testing \n• insufficient amount of material to be tested \n• toxicant of concern did not cover flavouring agents"

TREATMENT\nThe treatment of EVALI is symptomatic based on the presenting \nsymptoms which can be respiratory, gastrointestinal or constitutional \nin nature.\nFor respiratory symptoms, the following are done:\n• Oxygenation \nEnsure adequate oxygenation via nasal cannula, non-invasive or \ninvasive ventilation. In a cross-sectional study of 36 patients in \nPittsburgh, 64% patients required supplemental oxygen therapy during \nadmission with 20% on mechanical ventilation.32, level III\n• Antimicrobials\nIn a multicentre cross-sectional study involving 60 patients, 90% of \nEVALI patients were given antibiotics due to overlapping presentation \nand diagnostic uncertainty.17, level III As community-acquired pneumonia \nis a more common cause for hypoxaemic respiratory failure, antibiotics \nare strongly recommended with sequential de-escalation if no evidence \nof pulmonary or bloodstream infection is found.21, level III\nAntibiotics coverage are recommended to be given empirically for at \nleast 48 hours if history is unclear, if patient is intubated or has severe \nhypoxaemia despite supplemental oxygen.16, level III  \nAlternative diagnosis of concomitant EVALI with infections may be \nconsidered when laboratory evidences of infections are positive \nbut in whom clinicians feel that microbiologic diagnoses alone are \nincompatible with the clinical course or severity of the illness.32, level III\n• Treatment with empiric antimicrobials, including antivirals, should \nbe considered in accordance with established local guidelines and \nmicrobiology pattern.20, level III\n• Corticosteroids\nA multicentre cross-sectional study showed a rapid improvement within \ndays in 95% of EVALI patients received corticosteroids therapy. The \ninitial corticosteroids dosing and duration of therapy varied with severity \nof illness at presentation. Patients admitted to the intensive care unit \n(ICU) were given higher doses and longer courses of corticosteroids \nwhile outpatients had short bursts of oral corticosteroids.17, level III\nIn a narrative review, systemic corticosteroids and antibiotics were \nstarted immediately in severe cases.

IMPLEMENTING THE GUIDELINES\nThe management of EVALI should be guided by evidence-based \napproach in order to provide quality care to the patients. Several factors \nmay affect the implementation of recommendations in the CPG.\n7.1 Facilitating and Limiting Factors\nExisting facilitators for application of the recommendations in the CPG \ninclude:\n• wide dissemination of the CPG (soft- and hardcopies) to healthcare \nproviders\n• training and updates on EVALI in relevant scientific and professional \nmeeting, seminar, conference etc.\n• public awareness campaigns related to harmful effects of e-cigarette \nExisting barriers for application of the recommendations of the CPG \nare:\n• limited awareness and knowledge among healthcare providers on \nEVALI and its management \n• lack of awareness among patients, families/carers and community \non EVALI\n• no surveillance system on EVALI locally  \n7.2 Potential Resource Implications\nEVALI is a diagnosis of exclusion. Many tests are required to be done \nprior to confirmation of the diagnosis. Accessibility for imaging facilities \nespecially CT scan is limited. Besides, many laboratory tests necessary \nto be performed in the work-up for the diagnosis are not easily available. \nChemical profiling is another important factor to be addressed in \nidentifying the probable toxicants in EVALI. However, many issues are \nfaced in doing it which include:\n• poor cooperation of patients in providing product for testing \n• insufficient amount of material to be tested \n• toxicant of concern did not cover flavouring agents\nCurrently, in local toxicology laboratories, not all toxicants can be tested \ndue to lack of standardised testing methods and high cost involved.\nSurveillance system also need to be developed to capture the data \non EVALI for policy planning and guidance in clinical management. \nFurthermore, high level of evidence is required to improve the \nmanagement of the disease."
