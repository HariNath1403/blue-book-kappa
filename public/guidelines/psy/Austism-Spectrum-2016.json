A multidisciplinary review committee (RC) was \nactively involved during this CPG development process.\nA systematic literature search was carried out using the following databases: \nGuidelines International Network (G-I-N), Medline via Ovid, PUBMED, \nCochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) and International Health \nTechnology Assessment websites. A search strategy to cover all aspects \non management of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) was developed in the \nMedline database and adapted to other databases. Search strategies were a \ncombination of MeSH and keyword searches including abbreviations (refer to \nAppendix 1 on an example of Search Strategy). The search was restricted to \nhuman studies, literature published in the English language and the last ten \nyears. If the evidence was insufficient, the period of publication was extended \nfor another ten years. In addition, the reference lists of all retrieved literature \nand guidelines were searched to further identify relevant studies. All searches \nwere conducted from May 2012 till November 2013. Literature searches were \nrepeated for all clinical questions at the end of the CPG development process. \nThe aim was to identify and include any further relevant papers published \nbefore 28 February 2014. Future CPG updates will consider evidence \npublished after this cut-off date. The details of the search strategy can be \nobtained upon request from the CPG Secretariat.\nReference was also made to other CPGs on ASD such as i) Guidelines on \nTreatment, Diagnosis and Clinical Intervention for Children and Young People \nwith Autism Spectrum Disorder (SIGN 98-2007), ii) AMS-MOH Clinical Practice \nGuidelines 1/2010 - Autism Spectrum Disorders in Pre-school Children,  iii) \nAutism Spectrum Disorder by the Ministry of Health New Zealand 2008, and \niv) Autism diagnosis in children and young people: Recognition, referral and \ndiagnosis of children and young people on the autism spectrum (NICE, 2011). \nThese CPGs were evaluated using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research \nand Evaluation (AGREE) II prior to them being used as references. \nA total of 27 clinical questions were developed under different sections. \nMembers of the DG were assigned individual questions within these sections. \n(Refer to Appendix 2) The DG members met 23 times throughout the \ndevelopment of these guidelines.

        "text": "1.  Introduction\nAutism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterised \nby impairments in communication, behaviour and social functioning beginning \nin childhood. There is no local epidemiological study on ASD prevalence in \nMalaysia. However, in a feasibility study on the use of Modified Checklist for \nAutism in Toddlers (M-CHAT) among children of 18 to 36 months of age in child \nhealth clinics by Ministry of Health Malaysia, the prevalence of ASD in Malaysia \nwas approximately 1.6 in 1,000.1 In the USA, the overall prevalence of ASD is \n14.7 per 1,000 (one in 68) children aged 8 years and the prevalence shows an \nincreasing trend over the years.2 \nClinicians have been seeing an increasing number of children with speech delay \nand social communication difficulties who require further assessment. Children \nwith speech delay and behavioural issues are frequently placed in special \neducation classes without an accurate diagnosis. While waiting for diagnosis to \nbe established, these children should be referred for the relevant interventions.\nEarly diagnosis and prompt intervention of children with ASD is crucial for the \nbest outcome. The importance of early recognising and initiation of early referral \nto optimise the child’s potential must be emphasised. \nThis has prompted the need to produce a CPG for the wide usage of healthcare \nproviders in Malaysia as well as to provide assistance to parents of children with \nASD. It is hoped that this CPG can give a clear picture to primary care providers \nto direct these children in an efficient manner. Referral pathways to specialists \nand various interventionists have been outlined in this CPG in order to facilitate \nthis process.\n2. Risk Factors \nThe aetiology of ASD is unclear. It is multi-factorial which includes both genetic \nvulnerability and environmental factors. Only risk factors deemed important by \nthe DG and RC are discussed here.  \na. Advancing Parental Age\nParental age is among the most consistently studied risk factor and the risk for \nASD increases with parental age. \n ●\tMaternal age:\n ○ >35 years old vs 25 - 29 years old (OR = 1.31, 95% CI 1.19 to   \n1.45)3, level II-2\n ○ >40 years old vs <30 years old (OR = 2.1, 95% CI 1.48 to 2.86)4, level \nII-2\n1"

This will enable the child to be registered for \nbenefits such as:\n ● placement for special needs education if warranted\n ● welfare support including financial allowances from the department\n ● free services in the public sector\nThe registration form should be completed by the medical practitioner / \nmedical officer at the point of diagnosis.\n9. Monitoring and Preparation of Transition to Adult Services\nChildren with ASD require clinical monitoring for physical growth, behaviour \nand development, associated medical problems, as well as other \ncomorbidities, sexuality and safety. The main goal is for children with ASD to \nbecome independent and achieve their potential in all aspects of life, leading \nto a higher quality of life when they exit the school system. However, there is \na lack of reliable and valid measures to evaluate progress and change of a \nchild’s behaviour and functioning over time after the diagnosis of ASD.119, level II-2\nTransition for adolescents with ASD should be discussed and planned early \nby all involved in their management. ASD children have varying intellectual \nand functional abilities, hence the transition into adulthood has to be planned \nearly according to their individual abilities.120, level III \nVocational training, post-secondary education, day care activities and \nsupervised employment are options for these young people.121, level lI-1\nCare for children and adolescents with ASD should be continued into adult \nhealth services.

Implementing the Guidelines\nImplementation of this CPG is the responsibility of each healthcare provider. \nMechanisms should be in place to review care provided against the guidelines \nrecommendations. The reasons for any differences should be assessed and \naddressed where appropriate. Local arrangements should then be made to \nimplement the national guidelines in individual hospitals and clinics.Traditional and Complementary Medicine could not be recommended to \nchildren with autism spectrum disorder because of insufficient evidence \nand potential harmful effects.\n23"

Persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction across \nmultiple contexts,  as manifested by the following, currently or by \nhistory (examples are illustrative, not  exhaustive; see text):\n 1. Deficits in social-emotional reciprocity, ranging, for example, from \nabnormal social approach and failure of normal back-and-forth \nconversation; to reduced sharing of interests, emotions, or affect; to \nfailure to initiate or respond to social interactions. \n 2. Deficits in nonverbal communicative behaviours used for social \ninteraction, ranging, for example, from poorly integrated verbal and \nnonverbal communication; to abnormalities in eye contact and body \nlanguage or deficits in understanding and use of gestures: to a total \nlack of facial expressions and nonverbal communication. \n 3. Deficits in developing, maintaining, and understanding relationships, \nranging, for example, from difficulties adjusting behaviour to suit \nvarious social contexts; to difficulties in sharing imaginative play or \nin making friends; to absence of interest in peers.\nSpecify current severity: Severity is based on social communication \nimpairments and restricted, repetitive patterns of behaviour (refer to table \nbelow).\nB.  Restricted, repetitive patterns of behaviour, interests, or activities, \nas manifested by at least two of the following, currently or by history \n(examples are illustrative, not exhaustive; see text):\n 1. Stereotyped or repetitive motor movements, use of objects, or \nspeech (e.g., simple motor stereotypies, lining up toys or flipping \nobjects, echolalia, idiosyncratic phrases). \n    2. Insistence on sameness, inflexible adherence to routines, or \nritualized patterns of verbal or nonverbal behaviour (e.g., extreme \ndistress at small changes, difficulties with transitions, rigid thinking \npatterns, greeting rituals, need to take same route or eat same food \nevery day).\n   3. Highly restricted, fixated interests that are abnormal in intensity or \nfocus (e.g., strong attachment to or preoccupation with unusual \nobjects, excessively circumscribed or perseverative interests). \n42"

These disturbances are not better explained by intellectual disability \n(intellectual  developmental disorder) or global developmental delay. \nIntellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder frequently co-\noccur; to make comorbid diagnoses of autism spectrum  d i s o r d e r \nand intellectual disability, social communication should be below that \nexpected for general developmental level.\nNote: Individuals with a well-established DSM-IV diagnosis of autistic disorder, \nAsperger’s disorder, or pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise \nspecified should be given the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder. \nIndividuals who have marked deficits in social communication, but whose \nsymptoms do not otherwise meet criteria for autism spectrum disorder, should \nbe evaluated for social (pragmatic) communication disorder.\n43"
