        "text": "7 INTRODUCTION \nSince 1996, the management of Human Immune Deficiency Virus (HIV) infection has been \nrevolutionized highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), usually consisting of three or more antiretroviral (ARV) drugs that act on different targets in the virus.1 HAART is synonymous with antiretroviral therapy (ART) and combination-antiretroviral therapy (cART). ART has dramatically reduced opportunistic infection-related mortality among HIV infected persons, improved quality of life and survival. With ART, HIV has become a chronic manageable disease. The primary goal of this guideline is to provide HIV care practitioners with recommendations based on current knowledge of ARV drugs used for the treatment of HIV-infected adults in Malaysia. Clinical decisions regarding starting ART in HIV affected individuals should be tailored according to patient’s circumstances.   1.0\n What is New in this Guideline Compared to the 2014 Guideline? \nRelevant chapters have been reviewed and updated based on the current information and two new chapters about non-occupational postexposure prophylaxis (nPEP) and preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) had been added.\n \n 1.1\n F\nactors to Consider Before Initiating ART \n 1. Patient’\ns willingness to start and adhere strictly to treatment and follow up \n 2. Patient’\ns understanding of the possible adverse effects and the risk of immune\n \n reconstitution inflammator\ny syndrome (IRIS) \n 3. The \nART options those are available \n 4.\n \n Underlying medical diseases such as cardiovascular disease,\n diabetes mellitus,\n \n hyperlipidemia,\n and depression \n 5.\n \n Possible drug-drug interactions,\n dosing frequency and pill burden \n 6. Risk of primar\ny resistance, i.e. the acquisition of HIV infection from a partner who is\n \n already \non ART \n 7. Individual factors that may hinder adherence such as irregular working hours and \n \n  social support \n 1.2\n Goals and Benefits of AR\nT \nARVs cannot eradicate HIV from the human body nor cure HIV infection. The goals and benefits of ART include: \n 1. Reduce HIV related morbidity and mortality \n 2. Improve quality of life \n 3. Increase lifespan2,3 \n 4. Restore and preser ve immunologic function \n 5. Maximally and durably suppress viral load (VL)  \n 6. Reduction in complications associated with HIV / \nAIDS such as wasting syndrome,\n \n AIDS dementia and encephalopathy \n 7. Prevent HIV transmission to uninfected sexual partner and the unborn child \n 8. Prevent emergence of HIV drug resistance \nCHAPTER 1"

However, some patients may experience a slower increase of CD4+ T cell counts particularly when anti-retroviral therapy (ART) were initiated at very low baseline CD4 count levels.\n1\nCD4 counts should be monitored 4-6 months after initiation of ARV to:\n a. Assess immunologic response to antiretroviral therapy \n b. Assess the need to discontinue prophylaxis for opportunistic infections\nOnce the HIV viral load is suppressed \nand CD4 counts >350cells/mm3 on 2 occasions 6 months \napart, further repeat of CD4 count is not needed.2 (Unless treatment failure is suspected)\nHIV Viral LoadHIV viral load is more accurate and reliable than CD4+ T-cell count to monitor treatment response and for early detection of treatment failure.\nHIV Viral Load is Recommended of ART :\n a. Just before initiation of \nART**\n b. Ever\ny 4 to 6 months after initiation of ART to assess treatment response and for early\n \n detection of treatment failure\n c\n. Ever\ny 6 to 12 months in patients who have achieved virological suppression for ≥1 year.\n d. Before changing treatment regimes.\n  **subjected to resource availability\nEffective therapy should generally result in a 10-fold (1.0 log10) decrease in HIV-1 RNA copies/\nmL in the first month and suppression to less than 20 copies/mL by 6 months. A rebound in plasma HIV-1 RNA level after achieving an undetectable level should prompt a careful evaluation of the patient’s adherence to the treatment regimen and drug interactions (see also “Initial assessment of treatment failure” in chapter 4).\nMonitoring Other Parameters (Refer\n\tT\nable\n\t\n2.1)\nThe frequency of monitoring depends on the response to ART and the choice of drugs. At the \nminimum monitoring should take place at 2- 4, 8, 12 and 24 weeks after ART initiation and should subsequently be performed every 4-6 months once the patient has been stabilized on therapy. At each visit, monitoring need to be complemented by assessment of treatment side effects and adherence.\n2.2\n Co-T\nrimoxazole Preventive Prophylaxis (Refer\n\tT\nable\n\t\n2.2)\nCo-trimoxazole is recommended for Pneumocystis Jiroveci Pneumonia (PJP) prophylaxis to all \nsusceptible individuals as it has been shown to decrease the risk of PJP by nine fold in this population."

Retention is critical in reducing HIV-related morbidity and mortality, reducing the incidence of new infections, and development of ART resistance\nLinkage to Care • Step 1 \n Discussing the \nTest Result with the Patient\nDoctors need to confirm a positive result following a rapid HIV test. All positive HIV screening tests \nmust have a confirmatory test e.g. Western Blot or line immunoassay especially in asymptomatic patient and those who deny high risk behavior or exposure."

This guideline recommends clinical assessment at the end of 2 weeks of OI therapy.  If patient is stable and has improved with OI treatment, initiation of ART can be considered.\n3 \n In patients with OIs for which no effective treatment is available (cryptosporidiosis, microsporidiosis, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, and Kaposi’s sarcoma), ART itself can result in improvement and hence should be initiated as soon as possible. \nCHAPTER 4"

Cr\nyptococcal Meningitis \n Delay \ninitiation of ART at least until after completion of antifungal induction therapy (the first \n2 weeks) and possibly until the total induction/consolidation phase (10 weeks) has been completed. If effective ART is to begin prior to 10 weeks, the treating physicians should be prepared to aggressively address complications caused by Immune Reconstitution Syndrome (IRIS), such as elevated intracranial pressure (ICP). \n \n Delay in \nART may be particularly important in those with evidence of increased intracranial \npressure or in those with low CSF white blood cell counts.  \n \n For other forms of cr\nyptococcosis, where the risk of IRIS appears to be much lower, the \noptimal time to begin ART and antifungal therapy is not clear. However, it would seem prudent to delay initiation of ART by 2 to 4 weeks after starting antifungal therapy.  \nREFERENCES\n1.

        "text": "23 MANAGEMENT OF TREATMENT FAILURE:  AFTER FIRST LINE THERAPY\nThe aim of antiretroviral therapy is to achieve durable HIV virologic suppression, which leads \nto good treatment outcomes. Conversely, antiretroviral treatment failure can be defined as a suboptimal response to therapy leading to loss of virologic control. This is most accurately recognized by measuring and detecting a significantly raised HIV viral load (plasma HIV-1 RNA levels) while the patient is on highly active antiretroviral therapy.  \nSuccessful virological suppression is defined as having a sustained viral load that is undetectable \n(e.g. viral load <20 copies/mL where 20 is the lower limit of viral load detection) \n6.1\n Viral “Blips”\n \nDefined as isolated transient rises in viral load to above detectable level while on treatment \nafter having achieved prior viral suppression and is followed by re-suppression. The levels generally do not exceed 200 copies/mL. It may reflect technical variations in laboratory assay performance, or biological events associated with viral replication (immunization, other viral infection). Isolated “blips” are not associated with subsequent virologic failure, but frequent episodes or higher viral loads, increase the risk of failure in the future. These patients should be assessed for possible causes of treatment failure.  \n6.2\n Low Level Viremia \nDefined as a repeatedly detectable viral load that is <1000 copies/mL.\n This group comprise a \nspectrum of patients at different strata of viral loads. It is recognized that those with a higher level \nof detectable viremia have a higher tendency to develop virologic resistance and subsequent failure. Patients in this group would benefit from strict adherence to the current regime and close monitoring for subsequent virologic failure.\n6.3\n Virologic F\nailure \nThe viral load level to define virologic failure is not fully agreed on worldwide. WHO defines \nvirologic failure as either an incomplete virologic response which is a failure to achieve HIV viral load <1000 copies/ml 4–6 months after starting therapy or a virologic rebound where after previous virologic suppression, there is a persistent HIV viral load to >1000 copies/mL while on the same regiment.  Diagnosing treatment failure through other means like a drop in CD4 or on a clinical basis would lead to delays in diagnosis of failure and this predisposes to the selection of more drug resistance mutations, especially in the NRTI component.  \n6.4\n  Assessment of T\nreatment Failure \nMost patients on potent combination therapy maintain virological suppression for many years. \nHowever, ART failure is not uncommon, and it increases the risk for HIV disease progression; therefore, it should be addressed aggressively. \nCHAPTER 6"

If the patient is currently on therapy, continuing the failing regime rather than stopping it has been shown to be beneficial provided that the patient has not developed any side effects to the drugs and is clinically well. This has to be balanced with the fact that there is accumulation of mutations in the long term (as early as 1 year) which may negatively impact future treatment options should they become available.  Hence if a potentially viable regime should become available, it must be commenced as soon as possible.

The absence of a particular resistance does not rule out the possibility of underlying drug resistance. This may occur because the patient is currently not on that particular drug or due to a low frequency of certain viral variants not picked up by the test. Whenever in doubt, the interpretation of a resistance test should be discussed with an ID Physician.   Detected drug resistance is cumulative for a given individual; thus, all prior treatment history and resistance test results should be taken into account. \nREFERENCES\n1.

        "text": "29 PREVENTION OF MOTHER-TO-CHILD TRANSMISSION \nAntenatal combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) is the recommended method for prevention \nof maternal-to-child transmission (PMTCT)1. ART must be started in all pregnant mothers who \nare HIV+ regardless of CD4 count.  \nIdeally ART should be started at 14 weeks of pregnancy. Women who present after the 28 weeks \nmust commence ART without delay.  ID Physician should be consulted regarding the choice of \nAR\nT regimen in these late\n presenting \nwomen. There is increasing evidence to support the use of \nART regimen that includes Raltegravir / Dolutegravir in late presenting women to achieve more rapid viral load suppression and further reduce the risk of perinatal HIV transmission\n2,3. Strict \nadherences to ART must be stressed throughout the pregnancy. \nA viral load must be done between weeks 32–36 to determine ongoing risk of transmission to \nthe foetus. The mode of delivery will also be determined by the result. \n7.1\n Pregnant W\nomen Who are ART Naïve\nTable 7.0\n   •  Presenting CD4 and T\niming of ART Initiation \nPresenting CD4 cell count \n T\niming of ART initiation \n< 350 cells/µL \n This group of women must be started on \nART as soon\n as possible.\n ART should be started even in the first\n trimester in women presenting with opportunistic\n infections or \nWHO clinical stages 3 and 4.  \n≥ 350 cells/µL \n These women will need \nART primarily for PMTCT. In\n this scenario,\n commencement of ART may be delayed\n until week 14 of pregnancy\n. \nIt is well proven that ART prolongs life expectancy of HIV patients and significantly reduces \nserious AIDS and non-AIDS events. Therefore, ART in pregnant women should be continued for life after delivery regardless of their presenting CD4.  Women should be counselled on the benefits of continuing ART after delivery and the importance of ART adherence. A decision to discontinue ART after delivery can only be considered if the woman is not motivated to be on lifelong ART and her CD4 >350 cells/µL. To avoid resistance mutation, please refer to Chapter 5 for ways to cease NNRTI-based regimes.\n7.2\n W\nomen Who are Stable on ART before Pregnancy \nIn general, the existing ART is to be continued throughout pregnancy and after delivery. Special \neffort must be made to determine the current CD4 and viral load during the early stages of pregnancy. Consultation with an ID physician is strongly recommended if the patient is experiencing virological failure.   \nCHAPTER 7"

However, there is now good level safety   \n  evidence to recommend it as the preferred NNR\nTI even in the first trimester4.   \n b NVP should be used with caution in women with CD4 > 250 cells/uL because of possible increased risk of hepatotoxici ty and rash5. \n c Consider Raltegravir -based ART in late presenting women (>28 weeks) with unknown or high viral load (e.g. >100,000 copies/mL).   \n  Raltegravir can be switched to EFV or NVP after deliver\ny. \n7.4 Mode of Deliver y\nPre-labour Elective Caesarean Section (PLCS) has been proven to further reduce the risk of \ntransmission.6,7 The decision between performing PLCS or allowing spontaneous vaginal \ndelivery (SVD) is based on the viral load at 32–36 weeks of gestation and whether the mother has received any ART in the pre-pregnancy or antenatal period. PLCS should be undertaken at between 38 and 39 weeks’ gestation.  Women who have received ART before pregnancy or antenatally and have achieved maximal viral load suppression, have a choice between PLCS or SVD. There is no additional advantage of PLCS over SVD in terms of reduction of transmission in this group\n8.\nTable 7.2  •  Mode of Delivery According to Viral Load Quantification\n \n Viral Load at 32–36 weeks\n Mode of Deliver\ny\n < 50 copies/mL\n SVD\n 50–399 copies/mL\n PLCS recommended*\n > 400 copies/mL or unknown viral load\n PLCS\n* T ake into account the trajectory of the viral load leading up to time of delivery, length of time on ARVs, adherence issues, obstetric factors and the \n woman’\ns views.\n \n7.5 Intrapartum Intravenous Zido vudine Infusion \nIntrapartum IV Zidovudine (AZT) infusion (2 mg/kg for the 1st hour followed by 1 mg/kg/h \nsubsequently) is recommended for women with a viral load of >1000 copies/mL who present in labour or with ruptured membranes or who are admitted for planned PLCS.

        "text": "31 7.6   Women Presenting in Labour with No Prior ART Exposure \nIntravenous (IV) AZT should be given immediately in woman who is diagnosed with HIV infection presenting in labour and has not received prior ART   ART should be commenced immediately with fixed-dose AZT and 3TC with Raltegravir as the preferred 3rd agent because it rapidly crosses the placenta. If Raltegravir is not available, NVP or EFV should be used. After delivery, the ART can be switched to recommended first line ART regimen for non-pregnant patients.   The paediatrician caring for the newborn must be notified to ensure appropriate post exposure ARV prophylaxis for the infant\n10, 11. The HIV exposed infant should receive 6 weeks of oral AZT \nand 3 doses of NVP at birth, 48 hours later and 96 hours after the 2nd dose.\n7.7\n W\nomen Presenting with Spontaneous Rupture of Membrane (ROM) \nThe decision for the mode of delivery must consider of the maternal viral load, duration of \nROM and the expected time of delivery. After ROM, there is an increased risk of perinatal HIV transmission of 2% per hour\n7. Chorioamnionitis, a potential complication of prolonged ROM has \nalso been associated with perinatal transmission of HIV12. Therefore, delivery should be expedited \nfor women with pre-labour ROM at term, either with induction of labour or Caesarean section. There should be a low threshold to start antibiotics if signs suggestive of chorioamnionitis are present.  If the maternal HIV viral load is <50 copies/mL, vaginal delivery should be attempted unless there is obstetric contraindication. Caesarean section is recommended for women with viral load ≥ 50 copies/mL or unknown viral load. \n When premature rupture of membrane (PPROM) occurs at < 34 weeks, intramuscular steroids \nshould be administered in accordance to national guidelines. There should be multidisciplinary discussion between Obstetrician, Paediatrician and ID Physician about the timing and mode of delivery after PPROM. \n7.8   Breast-Feeding \nBreast-feeding is not recommended as it is associated with risk of transmission up to 14%\n10. For \nwomen on ART, compliance must be stressed if they insist on breast-feeding their baby."

        "text": "33 Adverse Events of ARVs occur with all antiretroviral agents and are a major reason \nfor switching or discontinuation of therapy and poor adherence. Differentiating between \nantiretroviral-related toxicities and disease complications can be difficult. \nActive surveillance for clinical signs and symptoms of adverse events should be initiated during \ncommencement of ART and during subsequent follow-ups to ensure the events are carefully recorded for future reference and managed accordingly.\nPrinciples of Managing Adverse Events \n 1. Identify the adverse event and assess its possible cause:\n antiretroviral agents, other \nmedications or other illnesses.\n 2. Assess severity of toxicities.\n [See Annex 5 Severity Grading]\n 3. If the reaction \nis mild or moderate, do not discontinue ART (except for NVP-induced \nrash / hepatotoxicity). Implement symptomatic therapy. Counsel and monitor patients, \nstress the importance of adherence despite toxicity.\n 4. Moderate or severe toxicities may require substitution of the drug with another of the same \nARV class, but with a different toxicity profile. [See Table 6]\n 5. Severe life-threatening toxicity requires discontinuation of \nALL ARV drugs until the \npatient is stabilized and the toxicity is resolved.\n 6. If there is intolerance due to an individual drug,\n a single drug substitution can be made; \nhowever, a single drug substitution should not be made if the patient is a known case of virological failure.\n 7. If \nthere is a need to discontinue ART, all antiretroviral medications must be stopped \ntogether. Stopping only one drug can lead to resistance. For stopping regimes with NNRTI, refer to ‘Stopping / Interrupting NNRTI’\nCHAPTER 8"

Collaboration between HIV and TB care services are recommended for the management of these patients.   10.1\n Isoniazid Prophylaxis Therapy (IPT) \nIsoniazid prophylaxis therapy for six months should be offered to all HIV patients once active TB has been ruled out.\n1 Thus all patients with HIV need to be screened for active TB by using \nstandard screening tool for TB.2 IPT can reduce overall TB risk by 33%. The recommended dose \nof isoniazid is 10mg/kg with a maximum dose of 300mg daily.  10.2\n AR\nT in HIV Individuals with TB \nART during anti TB treatment reduces mortality and results in earlier sputum smear and culture conversion. WHO recommends ART in all TB-HIV co-infected patients regardless of CD4 cell count.  However earlier ART is not associated with reduction in deaths in patients with CD4 >50cells/mm\n3 \nif there is no evidence of serious HIV disease.3,4 Deferral of ART initiation until the maintenance \nphase of TB treatment may be warranted in the setting of HIV and CNS-TB co-infection, as early ART treatment is associated with higher mortality.\n5 \n 10.3\n Optimal T\niming of ART in Treatment-Naive Patients \n 1.

In Malaysia, the Occupational Health Unit in the Ministry of Health has reported an incidence rate of 6.3 needle stick injuries per 1,000 HCWs in 2013. \n15.1\n Risk for Occupational T\nransmission of HIV to HCWs \nProspective studies of occupational transmission of HIV to HCWs have estimated that the average \nrisk for HIV transmission after a percutaneous exposure to HIV-infected blood is approximately 0.3% or 1 in 300 (95% CI=0.2–0.5%) and 0.09% or 9 in 10 000 (95% CI=0.0006–0.5%) after mucous membrane exposure\n 1. The risk of exposure to fluids or tissue has not been quantified \nbut is probably lower than that of HIV-infected blood exposures.  15.2\n F\nactors that may Increase the Risk of HIV Transmission  \n 1. High \nviral load – risk of transmission from a HIV patient with undetectable serum viral \nload is thought to be low \n 2. Deep injur\ny with hollow bore needle2 \n 3. T ypes of body fluids - high risk body fluids that carry significant risk include blood \nor visibly bloody fluids and other potentially infectious material (OPIM) (e.g semen, vaginal secretions, breast milk, cerebrospinal fluid, synovial fluid, pleural fluid, peritoneal fluid, pericardial fluid, and amniotic fluid). Exposure to non-bloody saliva, tears, sweat, nasal secretions, vomitus, urine or feces does not require PEP \n 4. Advanced HIV infection in the source patient \n Although there are concerns about HIV transmission from a source who is HIV\n-positive but in the \n“window period” before seroconversion, no such occupational transmission has occurred in the United States to date. There are also concerns regarding requests for PEP after percutaneous injuries from discarded needles. However, no HIV infections from such injuries have been documented.  15.3 \n T\nypes of Exposures in which PEP is Indicated \n 1. Percutaneous Exposure:\n Breach of skin by a sharp object (hollow-bore, solid-bore, \n \ncutting needles or broken glassware) that is contaminated with blood,\n visibly bloody  \n fluids or OPIM or that has been from the source patient’\ns blood vessel \n 2.\n  Bite from a patient with visible bleeding in the mouth that causes bleeding in the exposed worker \n 3.

Wound and skin exposure \nsites should be washed with soap and water. Squeezing the wound is not recommended as it may promote hyperemia and inflammation at the wound site, potentially increasing systemic exposure to HIV if present in the contaminating fluid. Alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, betadine or other chemical cleansers are best avoided.  15.5\n HIV Status of the Source P\natient (see Table 15.0 and 15.1) \nIf the HIV status of the source patient is not immediately available or complete evaluation of the exposure cannot be completed within 2 hours of the exposure, PEP with a 2-drug regime must be immediately initiated while awaiting final decision\n3. \n If the HIV status of the source patient is unknown, consent for voluntary HIV testing of the source patient has to be obtained. HIV testing using rapid tests is strongly recommended for the source patient. Results obtained using HIV rapid test kits can be used to decide on PEP for HCWs, however all positive rapid tests should be confirmed by confirmatory tests as soon as possible.  If the source patient’s rapid HIV test result is negative, but there has been history of high risk exposure in the previous 6 weeks, possibility of the source patient being in the “window period” must be considered. In such a situation, initiate PEP and discuss with Infectious Diseases Physician on additional testing to confirm infection.  If the source patient is known to be HIV-infected, the choice of PEP will depend on his current HIV viral load, his antiretroviral treatment history and previous resistance testing results. Do not delay the first dose of PEP while waiting for this information. Consult an Infectious Diseases Physician.  15.6\n HIV Status of the Exposed HCW \nBaseline testing of the HCW has to be done to identify those who were already infected at the time of exposure.\n In the rare event of seroconversion, following an occupational exposure, a \nnegative baseline test is the only way to document that the HCW was infected as a result of the exposure. \nTable 15.0  •  PEP recommendations when exposed to HIV positive source patient \n4\n* penetrating injur y to the skin with a sharp instrument containing fresh blood\n**\n with our current HIV viral load assay\n, this will be < 20 copies/ml\n(Adapted from Kuhar DT, Henderson DK, Struble KA et al.

        "text": "83 PRE EXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS (PREP) \nPre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) is when an HIV-negative person at substantial risk of HIV \ninfection takes TDF and (FTC or 3TC) to prevent him/herself from contracting the virus. It is a temporary method for reducing the chances of contracting HIV during phases of high-risk behaviour. Efficacy of PrEP ranges from 44% to 86% and is highly dependent on adherence.\n1-4 \n The decision to start PrEP should be made after a detailed assessment to ensure that patient is not infected with HIV (i.e. paying attention to symptoms of acute infection and awareness of the window period of the HIV test) and after the patient, fully understands the limitations of PrEP and the required adherence. More than one review may be required prior to starting PrEP and PrEP should always be used as part of a package of HIV prevention services which includes provision of condoms and lubricants as contraception, regular HIV testing, STI management and risk reduction counselling.\n17.1\n  Who W\nould You Recommend PrEP To? \n \n17.1.0\n Eligibility Citeria for PrEP5,6 \n  1.

However, PrEP can provide additional protection in certain situations: \n \n 1. As a bridge when the HIV infected partner has been taking \nART for less than 6 \n \nmonths  (AR\nT can take 3–6 months to suppress viral load) \n  \n 2. The uninfected partner is unsure about the HIV status of their partner or whether their viral load is suppressed.\n \nCHAPTER 17"
