        "text": "STATEMENT OF INTENT\nThis guideline was developed to be a guide for best clinical practice in the management \nof hypertension. All efforts were made to ensure references quoted were the most \ncurrent at the time of printing. Specific attempts were made to use local data and publications to ensure local relevance. Adherence to this guideline may not necessarily lead to the best clinical outcome in individual patient care. Every health care provider \nis responsible for the care of his/her unique patient based on the clinical presentation \nand treatment options available locally. However, adherence to this guideline is strongly recommended as a starting point in managing patients as it constitute the best available evidence at the time of writing.\nREVIEW OF THE GUIDELINES\nThis guideline was issued in 2018 and will be reviewed in 2023 or earlier if important \nnew evidence becomes available. This is an update to the Clinical Practice Guideline \non Management of Hypertension – 4th Edition (published 2013) and supersedes the previous. Electronic version will be made available on the following websites:\nwww.moh.gov.my \nwww.acadmed.org.my \nwww.msh.org.my\nDISCLOSURE STATEMENT\nThe panel members had completed disclosure forms. None held shares in pharmaceutical \nfirms or acted as consultants to such firms. Some may have been engaged as speakers in \nconferences or Continuing Professional Development activities mainly organised by the \nMalaysian Medical Association, the Malaysian Society of Hypertension, National Heart Association of Malaysia or similar professional non-governmental associations (NGOs). These events may or may not have received financial assistance from pharmaceutical \ncompanies as part of an educational grants (details are available upon request from the \nCPG Secretariat).\nSOURCE OF FUNDING\nThe development of the CPG on Management of Hypertension (5th Edition) was \nsupported via unconditional educational grant from Servier Malaysia Sdn. Bhd. The funding body was not involved in and has no influence on the development of the \nguidelines. An independent third party was engaged for all secretarial task and was \nappointed by and reported directly to the Malaysian Society of Hypertension.\nCLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES - MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION, 5TH EDITION (2018)"

        "text": "1. Hypertension is defined as persistent elevation of systolic BP of 140mmHg \nor greater and/or diastolic BP of 90 mmHg or greater. \n2. The prevalence of hypertension in Malaysians aged 18 years and above was 35.3% in 2015, a slight increase from 33.6% in 2011.\n3. Hypertension is a silent disease; unfortunately, in 2015, for every two \ndiagnosed patients in Malaysia there are 3 undiagnosed patients. This \nhas not changed since 2011. Blood pressure should be measured at every chance encounter. \n4. Untreated or sub-optimally controlled hypertension leads to increased cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and renal morbidity/ mortality and overall mortality.\n5. A systolic BP of 120 to 139 mmHg and/or diastolic BP of 85 to 89 mmHg \nis defined as ‘at risk blood pressure’ and should be treated in certain high \nrisk groups. \n6. Healthy living should be recommended for all individuals with hypertension \nand ‘at risk blood pressure’. \n7. Decisions on pharmacological treatment should be based on global \nvascular risks and not on the level of blood pressure per se. \n8. In patients with newly diagnosed uncomplicated hypertension and no compelling indications, choice of first line monotherapy includes ACEIs, \nARBs, CCBs, diuretics and ß-blockers.\n9. Only 37.4% of Malaysian patients achieved blood pressure control (<140/90 mmHg) while on treatment. Although this is an improvement from 2011 \n(34.7%) every effort should be made to achieve target blood pressure in all patients. Target blood pressure depends on specific patient groups. \n10. Combination therapy is often required to achieve target and may be instituted early in patients with stage II hypertension and in high risk \nstage I hypertension.\n11. A patients whose BP is not controlled on three or more drugs (including a diuretic) is by definition having resistant hypertension.

        "text": "In the Name of Allah, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful.\nIn 2015 the Ministry of Health released data from the National Health and Mortality \nSurvey which focused on Non Communicable Diseases. Diseases of the heart and \ncirculatory system (Cardiovascular diseases or CVD) still dominates the national health landscape being the number 1 cause of morbidity and mortality for the last few decades and is projected to do so for years to come. Of all the risk factors contributing to CVD, \nhypertension confer the greatest risk for both male and female based on the latest \nnational burden of disease in 2008. It is thus pertinent that all health care providers directly or indirectly involved with CVD know what is latest in the management of hypertension. \nI will like to record my utmost appreciation to all the members of the Working Group \non Hypertension for their tireless effort in coming up with this latest edition of the Hypertension Clinical Practice Guideline. This is the fifth in the series since it was \nfirst launched in 1998. This reflects the rapid evolution of knowledge in hypertension \ndriven by major outcome trials for which there were a few since the last edition 5 years ago. There are also more Malaysian studies quoted which is a testimony of the growing research interest in the topic nationally. I am happy to report that in some of the landmark multicentre clinical trials quoted, Malaysian researchers were actively \ninvolved. A special thanks to the Health Technology Assessment Unit of the Ministry of \nHealth Malaysia for ensuring that the development of this CPG conforms to the high standards it had laid down. \nAlthough the NHMS 2015 showed some positive developments in important key \nindicators on hypertension, there is still a lot of scope for improvement. It is hoped that this latest edition of the Hypertension CPG will continue to play an important role in controlling this major CVD risk factor. It is the hope of the Working Group that the \nrelease of this new edition will be followed by concerted effort by various stakeholders \nto implement the recommendations made. By so doing, we will have contributed in a significant way to combat the scourge of CVD particularly pre mature CVD. If that happens, this CPG will have served its purpose, God Willing.\nYours Sincerely,\nAbdul Rashid Abdul Rahman\nChairman, Working Group on Hypertension CPG 2018ForewordForeword\nCLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES - MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION, 5TH EDITION (2018) 7"

        "text": "RATIONALE\nThe Clinical Practice Guideline on the Management of Hypertension was developed \nto provide a clear and concise approach to all health care providers on the current concepts in the management of hypertension. Since hypertension is managed by various \nlevels of health care providers in Malaysia, attempts were made to ensure the different \nstakeholders will benefit from this CPG. This is reflected by the representation of the committee members who developed the guideline. There were four previous guidelines on hypertension; in 1998, 2002, 2008 and 2013.This edition is the fifth in the series and \nwas deemed necessary due to new evidence which has emerged since the last edition. \nPrior to the publication of this edition, the National Health and Morbidity Survey 2015 was published. The results of the survey showed that the prevalence of hypertension has increased while the awareness has decreased compared to a similar survey done in 2011. \nHowever the rate of blood pressure control in the hypertensive population has increased \nby 10% (now 37.4% of treated patients are controlled). This rate of blood pressure control is still poor when one compares with a large nation like Canada where the control rate was more than 80%. This may reflect the fact that clinicians are still not clear of the target \nblood pressure to achieve in their patients. It is hoped that this CPG will contribute \ntowards achieving the desired targets.\nGUIDELINE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS\nThe members of the Development Group (DG) for this Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) \nwere from the Ministry of Health (MOH), Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE) and \nprivate healthcare providers. The membership of the DG was multidisciplinary and most specialties are represented by at least 2 experts. These are Cardiovascular Medicine, Nephrology, Geriatrics, Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Family Medicine and Clinical \nPharmacology/Clinical Pharmacy. There are also specialties which are represented by 1 \nexpert. These include Endocrinology, Neurology and Public Health. Where there are at least 2 members, 1 act as the principal author and the other reviewer of the initial draft. Each draft will then be reviewed collectively in every DG meeting.\nThe CPG update was done based on the CPG Management of Hypertension 4th \nedition of 2013. In the update, systematic review methodology was used and the scope covered include epidemiology and public health, definition and classification, blood pressure management, diagnostic criteria, investigations, global cardiovascular risk \nevaluation, general principle of management, non pharmacological and pharmacological \nmanagement, management of patient sub groups and approach to resistant and refractory hypertension. Emerging areas in hypertension are also covered including Health Economics, Device Based treatment and scope for future research.

        "text": "search was carried out using the following electronic databases: mainly Medline via Ovid \nand Cochrane Database of Systemic Reviews and others e.g. Pubmed and Guidelines International Network. The search was done on Published English literature focusing \nmainly but not exclusively on Clinical Trials. Important observation studies, where relevant, \nwere also looked at. Unlike some CPGs, the search was not limited to literature published in the last fifteen years. This is because hypertension management has be powered and driven by good evidence generated over the last thirty years. Some seminal and practice \nchanging trials were conducted a few decades ago and the result so conclusive that \nrepeating the trials will be an act of futility. In addition, the reference lists of all recent Hypertension Guidelines i.e that written over the last 5 years only were retrieved and searched to further identify relevant studies. All searches were conducted from 24 May \n2017 to 5 January 2018. Literature searches were repeated for all clinical questions at \nthe end of the CPG development process allowing any relevant papers published after January 2018 to be included. Future CPG updates will consider evidence published after this cut-off date. \nReferences were also made to the most recent CPG on Hypertension from the American \nCollege of Cardiology / American Heart Association released in full in December 2017. This CPG was evaluated using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II prior to them being used as references.\nA total of 23 clinical questions were developed under 13 different sections. Members of \nthe DG were assigned individual questions within these sections (refer to Appendix 5 for Clinical Questions). The DG members met 9 times throughout the development of these \nGuideline. All literature retrieved were appraised by at least two DG members using \nCritical Appraisal Skill Programme checklist, presented in evidence tables and further discussed in each DG meetings. All statements and recommendations formulated after that were agreed upon. Where evidence was insufficient, the recommendations were \nmade by consensus of the DG. This CPG is based largely on the findings of systematic \nreviews, meta-analyses and clinical trials in particular trials where Malaysia participated. Where evidence are lacking or non existent, local practices are taken into consideration.\nThe literature used in these guidelines were graded using the US/Canadian Preventive \nServices Task Force Level of Evidence (2001), while the grading of recommendation was done using the principles of Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (Version 1.0 updated July 2017). The writing of the CPG follows strictly the requirement of AGREE II. \nOn completion, the draft of the CPG was reviewed by external reviewers both nationally \nand internationally. It was also posted on the Malaysian Society of Hypertension (MSH) official website for feedback from any interested parties. The draft was finally presented to the Technical Advisory Committee for CPG, and the HTA and CPG Council MoH Malaysia \nfor review and approval. Details on the CPG development methodology by MaHTAS \ncan be obtained from Manual on Development and Implementation of Evidence-based Clinical Practice Guidelines published in 2015 (available at http://www.moh.gov.my/index.php/pages/view/117).Rationale and Process of Guidelines Development\nCLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES - MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION, 5TH EDITION (2018) 11"

This is an increase from 33.6% in 2011 as compared to 34.6% in 2006. However, \nin terms of awareness, only 37.5% were aware in 2015 a drop from 40.7% in 2011. In \n2006, the awareness rate was 35.6%.3\nNo significant difference between gender was observed. There was a general increasing trend in prevalence with age, from 6.7% in the 18-19 years age group, reaching a peak of 75.4% among the 70-74 years age group. Based on the 2015 survey, prevalence was \nthe highest among other Bumiputras (37.3%) followed by Malays (36.4%), Indian (34.9%) \nand Chinese (34.2%).\n3\nHypertension was more prevalent in the rural area in all three NHMS: 36.9% versus 32.9% (2006), 36.5% versus 32.6% (2011) and 39.2% versus 34.1% (2015). In terms of gender differences, hypertension was more prevalent among males; 35.3% versus \n33.9% (2006), 34.2% versus 33% (2011) and 35.9% versus 34.8% (2015).\nThe relationship between BP and risk of cardiovascular events is continuous, consistent \nand independent of other risk factors. The higher the BP, the greater the chance of \nmyocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke and kidney diseases. The presence of each \nadditional risk factor, such as dyslipidaemia, diabetes mellitus or smoking status, compounds the risk. Therefore, the main aim of identifying and treating high BP is to reduce these risks of end organ damage or end organ complications.

Both the length and width of the inflatable \nbladder are important. The bladder length should encircle at least 80% of the \ncircumference whilst the width should be at least 40% of the circumference of the arm. The standard cuff size should be 13 cm x 24 cm. Too small a cuff size will give a falsely high reading. Too big a cuff will give a falsely low reading. \nBlood Pressure should be measured in both arms on the first visit and the higher \nreading is taken as the systolic BP.\n13 Patient should be rested at least 1 minute before \nmeasurement. At least 2 readings preferably 1-2 minutes apart should be taken in the same arm with the patient in the same position. A third reading should be taken if \nthe difference between the first two readings is greater than 10 mmHg. The last two \nreadings should be averaged. In the elderly, BP should be taken sitting & standing. Blood pressure measurements should not be done on the arm with arterio-venous fistula in haemodialysis patients.\nIf the difference in BP between the two arms is >20/10 mmHg, further evaluation is \nrequired to look for the cause.

Monotherapy can lower BP to <140/90 mmHg in approximately 20–50% of patients with mild to moderate hypertension\n103 If after a sufficient period of \ntreatment (up to six weeks) with monotherapy BP is still not controlled, three options are available;\n• the dose of the initial drug can be increased\n• the drug can be substituted with another class of drug\n• a second drug can be added\nChoices of combination therapy is as shown in Table 5-A & 5-B.\nIf target BP is not achieved despite showing some blood pressure lowering effect \nwith monotherapy, either increase the dose of the initial anti-hypertensive agent or \nadd a second anti-hypertensive.

After excluding these causes of uncontrolled hypertension, the patient \nis then defined as having resistant hypertension118 (Refer to chapter 10 on Resistant \nHypertension). A quick check on the possible causes of resistant hypertension is required.

For high and very high risk patients, it is advisable to bring the BP to target within 3 to 6 months.\n82 Once target BP is achieved, follow-up at three to \nsix-month intervals is appropriate. As a rule, once the BP is controlled, most patients will require life-long treatment. Patients must be counseled to have at least six monthly \nfollow ups even though the BP is well controlled and not to resort to merely going for \nrepeat prescription without seeing a doctor. During these visits, doctors should assess persistence of BP control, adverse reaction to treatment, global vascular risk (including new onset and pre-existing CV risk factors) and complications of hypertension with may \nhave developed since the last visit.\n5.3 When To Refer\nMost patients can be effectively managed by primary care practitioners.

Its presence increases the \nrisk of morbidity and mortality. In 2016 the prevalence of hypertension in Malaysian diabetics was 76%.\n138 Hypertension should be treated early in diabetes to prevent both \nmicrovascular and macrovascular complications and CV death.\n7.1.1 Threshold for Treatment\nPharmacological treatment should be initiated in patients with diabetes when the BP is persistently ≥140 mmHg systolic and/or ≥90 mmHg diastolic.\nThe presence of microalbuminuria or overt proteinuria should be treated even if the BP \nis <140/90 mmHg.

Hypertension in Special Groups7.2.1 Hypertension and Non-Diabetic Chronic Kidney Disease \nHypertension may be a cause or consequence of chronic kidney disease (CKD).164,165 \nCKD is one of the commonest causes of secondary hypertension. Hypertension \nin CKD is often associated with an elevated serum creatinine, proteinuria and/or \nhaematuria. The prevalence of hypertension increases with increasing levels of renal \nimpairment, and approximately 50-75% of individuals with GFR <60 ml/ min/1.73m2 \n(CKD stages 3–5) have hypertension.166 Hypertension accelerates the progression of \nCKD and may lead to end stage renal disease (ESRD). In addition, CKD is associated \nwith an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. There are proven benefits of \nblood pressure lowering for prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with \nmoderately reduced kidney function167 as well as those on dialysis.168,169(Level 1)\nTight control of BP in patients with CKD is therefore important. BP goals depend on \nurinary protein excretion. The target BP should be <140/90 mmHg for patients with \nCKD170-172 (Level I) and <130/80 mmHg for those with proteinuria ≥1g/24hours.173(Level I) \nWhere well tolerated, aiming towards an Automated Office Systolic BP of 120mmHg in patients aged >50 years with nondiabetic nephropathy, GFR>20 ml/min/1.73m\n2 \nand proteinuria <1g/day has shown cardiovascular benefits.174,175(Level II-2) When \naiming towards <120 mmHg systolic, close monitoring is recommended to detect treatment-related adverse effects including hypotension, syncope, electrolyte \nabnormalities and acute kidney injury.\n175 All anti-hypertensive drug classes can be \nused to achieve this goal.167 \nIn the management of hypertension in CKD, control of BP and proteinuria are the \nmost important factors in terms of retarding CKD progression. Anti-hypertensive \nagents that reduce proteinuria have an advantage in patients with nondiabetic \nproteinuric nephropathy. Meta analyses of comparative trials concluded that \nACEI conferred an anti-proteinuric effect greater than other anti-hypertensive \ndrugs.176(Level 1) Overall 30% reduction in incidence of ESRD with ACEI can be \nexpected.177 The anti-proteinuric effect and reduction in ESRD was beyond that \nattributable to the BP lowering effect.172,178(Level I) This anti-proteinuric effect of ACEI \nwas most prominent in patients on a low sodium diet or those treated with diuretics. Patients with proteinuria >3g/24 hours benefit the most.\n172,178 The advantage of ACEI \nis most apparent in patients with rapid progression of renal disease associated with proteinuria. ARBs are similar to ACEI in lowering BP and reducing proteinuria.\nCombined RAS blockade can reduce proteinuria more than monotherapy.\n179 \nHowever this is associated with an increased risk of hyperkalaemia, hypotension and \nrenal failure.180(Level 1) Hence, this approach is not recommended in patients with CKD.\nRenal insufficiency should not be a contraindication to starting ACEI or ARB therapy, \nnor should it be a reason for discontinuing therapy.

Hypertension in Special Groups7.2.2 Renovascular Hypertension\nRenovascular hypertension (RVH) is defined as a rise in arterial pressure attributable \nto reduced perfusion of the kidney(s).184 It is important to diagnose renovascular \nhypertension as it is potentially reversible. Treatment also has the potential to restore \nor preserve renal function. The aetiology of renovascular hypertension includes the \nfollowing:\n• Atherosclerotic renovascular disease\n• Fibromuscular dysplasia\n• Takayasu’s arteritis\n• Transplant renal artery stenosis\nAtherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (ARAS) is an important cause as it can lead to ESRD.\n185 It is also associated with coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease \nand peripheral vascular disease. In patients with ARAS older than 60 years, the five- year-survival is 45% in patients with bilateral ARAS and 18% in those requiring dialysis \ntherapy.\n186\nThe presence of a stenotic renal vessel in a patient with hypertension does not \nnecessarily equate to RVH.

This is especially important in the presence \nof other risk factors. Multiple CHD risk factors combine as multipliers, to increase CHD risk that is greater than the sum of its individual components. Management of patients with hypertension should consider the individual’s absolute CHD risk. \n(Refer Table 3-D Risk Stratification) The decision to initiate drug treatment should \ntake this into consideration.\nAlthough the recommended target is <140/90 mmHg, in those at high CV risk \nin whom it is deemed safe on clinical grounds, and in whom drug therapy is well tolerated, aiming for a lower blood pressure may be considered.\n116,117,194(Level 1)\nClinical studies have also shown that coronary events in hypertensive patients with CHD are reduced in those whose blood pressure is controlled.\n195(Level 1) Based on \nmany studies using different groups of antihypertensives, the benefits are achieved predominantly by lowering the blood pressure rather than the use of any specific \nclass of antihypertensive agent.\n96,196,197(Level 1) \nThere are clinical trials showing morbidity and mortality benefits of anti-hypertensive \nagents such as ß-blockers, ACEIs and ARBs,198-200(Level 1) following myocardial \ninfarction.

Chronic, \nuncontrolled hypertension can cause heart failure with reduced ejection fraction \n(≤40%) (HFrEF).205 \nIn hypertensive patients with HFrEF, hypertension aggravates heart failure by increasing left ventricular afterload, promoting left ventricular remodeling and \nprogression of myocardial damage.

In these patients, ACE inhibitors and ß-blockers \nare recommended for initial therapy. ß-blockers are contraindicated in the presence \nof acute heart failure. Careful monitoring for hyperkalaemia is recommended when \ncombining an aldosterone antagonist with an ACEI or ARB. The evidence for ARB is \nless convincing211 but they may be used for ACEI intolerant patients.212-218\nIn patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction >50% (HFpEF), blood pressure control is important. For these patients, results with ARBs have been \nmixed.\n213,215 Several randomised control trials evaluating the efficacy of ARBs found \nno effect on prognosis including all-cause mortality. In these patients spironolactone has been shown to reduce hospitalisation with HF.\n219\nA meta-analysis with ACEI has shown a modest effect on HFpEF.220(Level 1) However, a \nlarge-scale, prospective study (Swedish Heart Failure Registry) indicated that the total mortality rate was lower in patients taking RAS blockers.\n221 \nShould hypertension be persistent in spite of ACEI / ARB, aldosterone antagonist \nand/or ß-blocker, CCBs which are not negatively inotropic, such as amlodipine \nand felodipine, can be added.

The definition of hypertension in the older adult (>65 years old) is the same as that of the general adult population. Hypertension is an \nincreasingly important public health concern as our population ages. The prevalence \nof hypertension in adults >65 in Malaysia has been reported to be 71.7%,\n288 and the \nproportion of older adults in Malaysia is expected to increase from 9.0% in 2017 to 15% of the total population by 2030.\n289\nHypertension magnifies the risk for cardiovascular disease, with each 20 mmHg increase in systolic blood pressure and 10 mmHg increase in diastolic BP associated with a doubling in risk of death from stroke and coronary artery \ndisease.\n255 In older adults, the risk of cardiovascular events and death is twice as \nthat observed in younger individuals at same levels of BP.4 SBP increases linearly \nwith age, leading to an increase in prevalence of isolated systolic hypertension \nin the older adult. SBP is a better predictor of cardiovascular events than DBP.290  \nTreatment of hypertension in the older adult, particularly of high SBP, significantly \nreduces the risk of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and cardiovascular \nevents (myocardial infarction, heart failure and stroke).6,79,83,113,117 ,151,253,262,263,287 ,291-295(Level 1) \nThere is evidence that this benefit extends to even the very elderly (>80 years old).113(Level1)\nDespite the profusion of published data, there remains ongoing debate regarding optimal management of BP in the older adults, with various guidelines espousing different targets and treatment recommendations. The term ‘hypertension in older \nadults’ itself causes some difficulty as it encompasses the age groups of the ‘young-\nold’ (65-70 years) to the ‘old-old’ (>80 years). This group of patients is extremely heterogeneous with regards to comorbidities, frailty, and physical and cognitive functioning. Hypertension trials are also widely variable in terms of age cut-offs, \ninclusion and exclusion criteria, patient cardiovascular risk profiles, treatment regimens \nand method of BP measurement.\nCurrent evidence supports treating the older adult to a target SBP of <150 mmHg to \nimprove all cardiovascular outcomes.\n6,113,262,293(Level 1) There is some evidence that targeting \na SBP of <140 mmHg may be beneficial, especially in reducing risk of stroke,296,297 whilst \na recent trial supports even stricter targets (SBP <130 mmHg).117(Level 1)\n7.5.1 Considerations in the Older Adults\nHypertension management in older adults are often complicated by the various \npathologies associated with aging. There are numerous challenges including multiple comorbidities, postural hypotension, falls, functional and cognitive impairment and \nfrailty. These conditions frequently overlap.

Therefore, it is important to critically evaluate the need for each medication.\n7.5.1.3 Postural Hypotension and Falls\nAdvancing age is associated with an independent increase in prevalence of postural hypotension. Postural hypotension is defined as a sustained reduction in SBP of at least 20 mmHg or DBP of 10 mmHg from lying to standing position.\n317 \nIn symptomatic older adults it is recommended to check BP up to 3 minutes of standing.

Hypertension in midlife (40-65 years old) has been \nfound in longitudinal studies to be a risk factor for developing cognitive decline in later life. Hypertension predisposes mainly to development of vascular \ncognitive impairment, but has also been found to be a risk factor for Alzheimer’s \npathology.\n325,326(Level II-2)\nEvidence from randomised controlled trials on the effect of antihypertensive treatment on incident cognitive decline and dementia in older adults has largely been negative, due to most trials being of insufficient duration,\n6,295,327-329 \nalthough observational studies of up to 20 years suggest a benefit.301 Conversely, \nobservational data suggest that aggressive treatment of hypertension (to <130 mmHg SBP and <70 mmHg DBP) in older adults is associated with increased risk \nof new-onset cognitive impairment,\n301,325,326 and more rapid cognitive decline in \nindividuals with established dementia.330\n7.5.1.5 Frailty\nFrailty increases in the older adult, especially in those over 80.331 It is defined as \nincreased vulnerability to physical stressors as a result of reduced physiological \nreserve.332 The HYVET trial showed benefit of treating hypertension in adults >80 \nyears of age and did not find any effect of frailty on the benefit of hypertensive treatment. However, it should be noted that HYVET excluded the very frail. \nPost-hoc analysis of the SHEP trial\n333(Level II-1) found that the benefit of treatment \non cardiovascular and all-cause mortality disappeared in those with functional \nimpairment. Observational studies have also demonstrated the importance of \nfrailty status on hypertension and outcomes.301,303(Level II-2) Therefore, results from \nthe HYVET and SPRINT trials which support treatment in the very elderly and \nintensive therapy respectively need to be interpreted with caution. Goals should \nbe driven by patients’ functional status and comorbidities.\n7.5.2 Assessment\nRecommendations for BP measurements in older adults are similar to those for the \ngeneral population. If there is presence of postural hypotension, the standing BP is used to guide treatment decisions.\nIt is very important to ascertain hypertension and the true level of BP before \ncommencing or adding pharmacological therapy. We advocate multiple readings using an automated office blood pressure monitor after up to 3 minutes of quiet \nrest.\nEvaluation of older patients with hypertension should not differ from that of younger \nadult populations.

Managing \nblood pressure in isolation is not conducive to achieving a patient-centered approach. BP targets depend on many factors unique to each patient. Healthcare \nproviders must be mindful that in older adults, additional aspects must be \nconsidered before starting therapy. These include frailty, physical and cognitive \nfunctioning, and tolerance to treatment. Less strict BP targets may be considered \nin certain situations.\n• Treatment of hypertension in the older adult, particularly of high SBP, significantly reduces the risk of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, heart failure \nand stroke), even in the very elderly.\n• There is strong evidence of benefit for treating to target SBP <150 \nmmHg.\n• There is some evidence for treating to even lower target SBPs in certain subgroups of older adults.\n• Older patients with multimorbidities, cognitive or functional impairment and frailty are under represented in randomised control trials for hypertension. Observational studies suggest worse outcomes in these patients.\n• Measure standing BP and use it to guide treatment decision. (Grade C)\n• Assess comprehensively to confirm hypertension. (Grade C)\n• Assess for frailty, mobility, function, cognition, nutrition, postural hypotension and falls. (Grade C)\n• Individualised treatment based on clinical scenarios.

Hypertension in Special Groups7.6.1.3 Key Points in Primary Care Practice\nThe primary care physician plays an important role in the prevention and early \ndetection of PE and its complications. An obstetrician should lead the joint management of women with hypertensive disorders in pregnancy.\n1. Preconception counseling and adjustment of treatment in women with chronic hypertension.\nWomen with chronic hypertension may require a change in the type of anti-\nhypertensive agent used pre-pregnancy.\n345(Level III) The drugs of choice in \npregnancy are methyldopa and labetalol (Table 7.6-A). Atenolol has been shown to lead to fetal growth restriction. The use of ARBs, ACEIs and thiazide \ndiuretics are associated with fetal anomaly and are therefore contraindicated \nin pregnancy.\n346 Women in the reproductive age group requiring these drugs \nshould be on effective contraception. In the event of unplanned pregnancy, the drugs must be stopped.\n347\nIt should be noted that the treatment of hypertension in pregnancy is solely for maternal safety particularly for prevention of intracranial bleeding. It does not reduce the risk of development of preeclampsia or perinatal mortality, \nnor improve fetal growth.\n348 There is still no clear evidence on the target \nBP that should be achieved prior to or during pregnancy. A recent study \ncomparing less tight (target DBP of 100 mmHg) against tight (target DBP 85 \nmmHg) control of BP in women with non-proteinuric chronic hypertension or \ngestational hypertension showed no significant differences between these two groups with regard to both maternal and perinatal complications.\n349\nRisk Risk Factors\nModerate349• primigravida\n• age >40 years\n• pregnancy interval >10 years\n• body mass index of >35 kg/m2 at first visit\n• family history of PE\n• multiple pregnancy\nHigh349• hypertensive disease during previous pregnancy\n• chronic kidney disease\n• autoimmune disease such as Systemic Lupus \nErythematosus (SLE) or anti-phospholipid syndrome (APS)\n• type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus, and\n• chronic hypertension2.

Aspirin\nWomen with ≥2 moderate or one high risk factor should be started \non low dose aspirin from 12 weeks up to 16 weeks of gestation until delivery.\n350 The dosage should be 100-150 mg and taken at bedtime in \norder to significantly reduce the incidence of PE.351-353\nb. Calcium A systematic review showed that low dose calcium supplement (generally 500-1000mg daily) commenced before 20 weeks gestation reduces the \nrisk of PE.\n354 \nc. Vitamin DThere is no proven role of vitamin D in reducing the risk of PE.\n355\nd. Others\nOther supplements in pregnancy such as marine oil, garlic, and pyridoxine have no proven benefits.\n356-358 Combined vitamin C and E (i.e. tocopherol \nfrom soybean) should be avoided because they significantly increase the incidence of low birth weight without any preventive effect against PE.\n359\n4. Prediction of the incidence of preeclampsia\nA predictive test that is available locally, measuring serum sFlt-1/PlGF ratio \nfrom 20 weeks of gestation onwards has good negative predictive value for a week. It is useful in identifying which patients require admission and close monitoring. It will also help to decide on the need for antenatal \ncorticosteroids in anticipation of pre-term delivery.\n360\n5. Fetal anomaly screening\nWomen with chronic hypertension have about 20-30% increased risk for \nfetal congenital cardiac anomaly.361 These women are to be referred to \nthe Maternal-Fetal Medicine (MFM) specialist in the tertiary centre to be \nrecommended to undergo nuchal translucency (NT) scan at 12-14 weeks \nfollowed by a detailed ultrasound scan at 22-24 weeks of gestation.

New onset of cerebral or visual disturbances\nDiagnosis of severe preeclampsia should not depend solely on the above criteria. If in doubt, it is better to over rather than under diagnose. This will prevent delay \nin referral. Any patient with preeclampsia should be closely monitored, as the \nprogression to severe preeclampsia is unpredictable and rapid.\nIn the event of an acute hypertensive crisis, IV hydralazine, IV labetalol, or \noral nifedipine, may be used to lower the BP.\n365,366(Level I) Sublingual nifedipine \nis no longer recommended (Table 7.6-B).367(Level III) Diuretics are generally \ncontraindicated as they reduce plasma volume, may cause Intrauterine Growth \nRestriction (IUGR) and may possibly increase perinatal mortality.

Direct cost includes the cost of treatment (drugs, investigations, healthcare providers time and transportation) whereas indirect cost measures the income lost due to hypertension \nand its complications. A difficult to measure indirect cost would be the cost to society \nin managing patients with sequelae of hypertension (e.g. managing patients with a hypertensive bleed, hypertensive heart and renal failure). \nA study in a primary care setting showed that more than half of treatment cost is driven \nby antihypertensive medications. This cost increases as the severity of hypertension increases.\n409,410 The direct cost to the Ministry of Health for antihypertensive medication \nhas steadily increased from RM570.3 million in 2014 to RM608.8 million in 2016.411\nThe direct and indirect cost for hypertensive complications is not available for Malaysia.

Diuretics work via inducing natriuresis which alter long term sodium balance, leading to reduced \nperipheral vascular resistance and sustained blood pressure reduction. Diuretics provide \nsynergistic effect to almost all anti-hypertensive agents, particularly renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockers. There were also outcome data that supported the potential cardiovascular benefits of thiazide diuretics, particularly in those with preserved renal \nfunction.\n419 (Level 1)\nThiazide diuretics are classified into thiazide (e.g. hydrochlorothiazide) and thiazide-\nlike diuretics, e.g. chlorthalidone (CTD) and indapamide. Locally, hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) is the most commonly used thiazide diuretic. Most positive outcome studies \nused thiazide-like diuretics, i.e. chlorthalidone\n5,89 and indapamide.113 Even though there \nwere no head to head trials comparing HCTZ and CTD, a systematic review and network \nmeta-analyses reported superiority of CTD to HCTZ in preventing cardiovascular \nevents. This difference might be attributed to the pleomorphic effects of CTD or to the \nshorter duration of action of HCTZ.420(Level II-1)\nHCTZ is effective in the range of 12.5mg – 50mg daily dose.421(Level II-1) However a dose \nabove 25mg per day is more likely to cause electrolyte and metabolic adverse effects. \nThe major out come data for the use of thiazide-like diuretics (CTD) was from ALLHAT \nstudy.89(Level II-1) Chlorthalidone-based regimen was equally effective in reducing clinical \noutcome as lisinopril and amlodipine. In chronic kidney disease with eGFR<30ml/min/1.73m\n2, thiazide diuretics are less effective and a switch to loop diuretics is \nrecommended.  \nA recent case-control study highlighted a significant increase in the risk of skin and lip squamous cell carcinoma among thiazide diuretics users.\n422,423 (Level II-2) There was a clear \ndose-response effect with the highest cumulative dose of HCTZ having the highest risk. There was more than 7-fold increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma for a cumulative \nuse of ≥200,000 mg HCTZ (equivalent to 50mg daily for a duration of more than 11 \nyears).

The common side effects of the centrally acting agents include \ndrowsiness, dry mouth, headache, dizziness and mood change. Moxonidine is less likely to cause these reactions. The side-effects may decrease after a few weeks of continued treatment. In general, treatment should begin with the lowest possible \ndose to minimise the side-effects.\nAlpha-methyldopa has been in use for many years.

It can be used as monotherapy in patients with mild to moderate hypertension or in combination with other anti-hypertensive agents. Studies have suggested that it may improve the metabolic profile of \npatients with impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes. Rebound hypertension on \ncessation of the drug is less likely compared to clonidine but abrupt withdrawal is not recommended.

The usefulness of this \nclass of drugs is limited by their side-effects, including headache, compensatory \ntachycardia, salt and water retention.

Those targeting aldosterone (anti-aldosterone agents). The strategy is to either \nblock aldosterone production (aldosterone synthase inhibitors) or to block its \nreceptor (mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists). \nThe prototypes of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists would be \nspironolactone and eplerenone. Finerenone is the latest in this class and is currently undergoing phase III trials, not only for hypertension but also for diabetic nephropathy and heart failure. Because it has low affinity for steroid receptors, there is a lower incidence of gynaecomastia, erectile dysfunction, \nand reduced libido.\n2. Those targeting the classical RAS. These would include angiotensin converting \nenzyme 2 activators, angiotensin type 2 receptor agonists and vaccines against \nthe angiotensin type 1 and type 2 receptors.\n3. Centrally acting aminopeptidase inhibitors to inhibit excessive sympathetic \noutflow from the brain.\n4. Vasopeptidase inhibitors which degrade natriuretic peptides.\n5. Dual-acting angiotensin receptor–neprilysin Inhibitors. The combination of valsartan and sacubitril is already in clinical use. However this combination has \nfound its niche in the management of heart failure rather than hypertension.\nCLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES - MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION, 5TH EDITION (2018)112"

They refer to a broad set of health care practices that are not part of that country’s own tradition and are not \nintegrated into the dominant health care system.\nHerbal medicines\nHerbal medicines include herbs, herbal materials, herbal preparations and finished \nherbal products, that contain as active ingredients parts of plants, or other plant materials, or combinations.\nIn most countries including Malaysia, the traditional treatment of hypertension will \nconsist of:\n• oral, usually herbal medication\n• various forms of relaxation exercises, including yoga and qigong\nHerbs used in hypertension\nThere are few publications in the English literature on the treatment of hypertension with herbs. The most quoted is by Tabassum and Ahmad\n473, the “Role of Natural \nHerbs in the Treatment of Hypertension”. They comprehensively describe almost 50 herbal remedies for hypertension, including garlic, ginger, roselle, black plum, \nmistletoe, wheat bran, cocoa, wild tomato, sesame, radish, pomegranate, basil, cork \nwood, tomato, linseed, flaxseed, black mangrove, French lavender, pima cotton, soybean, carrot, swamp or river lily, Chinese hawthorn, black bean, coffee weed, tea, green oat, breadfruit, celery and prickly custard apple. \nAn extensive online review on Medscape\n474 showed that herbal medicines for \nhypertension have not undergone the rigorous testing for efficacy and safety \nthat is expected of modern drugs. None have undergone the gold standard of \nrandomised placebo controlled trials. On top of that, there are reports that various \nherbal preparations (usually in capsule form) have been adulterated with modern drugs. For example, glibenclamide has been found in anti-diabetic preparations, and sildenafil has been found in compounds to increase male virility. Corticosteroids \nhave also been added to traditional herbal medicine, with prolonged usage causing \nCushing’s Syndrome and hypertension. Hence, anecdotal reports on the efficacy of certain herbs cannot be relied on. \nCLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES - MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION, 5TH EDITION (2018)114"

Yoga and qigong or any other form of relaxation \nexercises may usefully complement drug treatment.\n• Relaxation therapy may complement non-pharmacological and \npharmacological treatment of hypertension however it is not recommended as primary treatment for hypertension.

Further confirmatory results from other trials are awaited to confirm the clinical indication for multi-electrode RDN for newly diagnosed hypertension.\n503\nBaroreceptor activation therapy (BAT) is based on sympathetic inhibition by carotid sinus stimulation.
