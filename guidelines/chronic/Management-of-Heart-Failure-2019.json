        "text": "2\nMESSAGE FROM THE DIRECTOR GENERAL OF HEALTH\nIt gives me great pleasure to write a message for another \nClinical Practice Guideline (CPG) on the Management of Heart Failure (HF), which is now in its fourth edition. The first CPG in HF was published in 2000 with revisions in 2007 and 2014. \nCardiovascular disease is an important cause of morbidity \nand mortality in Malaysia. HF, the end stage of most diseases of the heart, is a common medical problem encountered in clinical practice and is an important cause of hospital           admissions and readmissions. It is also an important cause of hospital expenditure. \nSince the last CPG in 2014 the treatment modalities for the \nmanagement of HF has expanded extensively. There have been many significant developments in the use of drugs and devices. These guideline-changing data have been                 incorporated into this CPG, taking into account our local health resources.\nA CPG is only successful if it is accepted and implemented.        \nI encourage all healthcare providers involved in the                    management of HF in children and adults to adopt these recommendations in your practice.\nFinally, I would like to congratulate the Chairman and \nmembers of the Expert Committee for developing such a comprehensive CPG.  Thanks to you, as well as the External Reviewers, for your time and effort.\nDatuk Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah\nDirector-General of Health Malaysia"

Heart Failure (HF), the end stage of most diseases of the heart, is a common medical problem encountered in general practice and is an important cause of hospital admissions and readmissions. It is also an important cause of hospital expenditure. As the population ages, the prevalence of HF is expected to increase.\nThe 1st Clinical  Practice  Guidelines  (CPG) in HF was published in 2000 with \nrevisions in 2007 and 2014. Since then, there have been many new developments in this field. Thus the publication of this 4th edition is timely. This CPG proposes a structured multidisciplinary strategy for the seamless care of patients with HF between hospital and community care.\nThis CPG was drawn up by a committee appointed by the National Heart Association \nof Malaysia and Ministry of Health. It consists of a multidisciplinary team of cardiologists, nephrologists, family medicine specialists, general physicians and pharmacists from the government, private sectors and the public Universities. The external reviewers were also made up of a  multidisciplinary team. Members of the public - patients and carers - however, were not included.\nObjectives:\nThe objectives of this CPG are to:\n  Update the current management of HF based on recent evidence with respect to:\n    Prevention \n     Diagnosis\n     Treatment – pharmacotherapy, device and surgical therapy\n     Rehabilitation \n    End of life and palliative care \n  Recognise and manage HF in special populations:\n     Adult congenital heart disease\n     Geriatric population\n     Pregnant women\n  Develop a structured multidisciplinary strategy for the management of patients  \n  with HF both in the primary and secondary care setting.\nRATIONALE AND PROCESS OF GUIDELINES DEVELOPMENT"

        "text": "7Process\nThe last CPG published in 2014 was used as a base. In addition to the previous \nclinical questions that needed to be updated, the Expert Panel formulated new questions that needed to be addressed. These clinical questions were then divided into sections and each member was assigned one or more topics.\nA review of current medical literature on HF from 1st October 2013 (the date of the \nlast CPG) till 31st August 2018 was performed. Literature search was carried out using the following electronic databases - PubMed and Cochrane Database of Systemic Reviews.The following MeSH terms or free text terms were used either singly or in combination:\n“Heart Failure”, “Congestive Cardiac Failure”, “Acute Heart Failure, “Chronic Heart \nFailure” “Right Heart Failure”, “Left Heart Failure” [MeSH], “Heart Failure Reduced Left Ventricular Function”, Heart Failure Preserved Left Ventricular Function” [MeSH], Acute decompensated heart failure, tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy, heart failure mid-range, refractory heart failure, terminal heart failure, end stage heart failure, cardio-oncology.\nThe search was filtered to clinical trials and reviews, involving humans and \npublished in the English language. The relevant articles were carefully selected from this huge list. In addition, the reference lists of all relevant articles retrieved were searched to identify further studies. Experts in the field were also contacted to obtain further information. International guidelines on HF -  the American Heart Association / American College of Cardiology and European Society of Cardiology -  were also studied. All literature retrieved were appraised by members of the Expert Panel and all statements and recommendations made were collectively agreed by the group. The grading of evidence and the level of recommendation used in this CPG was adapted from the American College of Cardiology / American Heart Association and the European Society of Cardiology (Table 1, Page 12).\nAfter much discussion, the draft was then drawn up and submitted to the Technical \nAdvisory Committee for Clinical Practice Guidelines, Ministry of Health Malaysia and key health personnel in the major hospitals of the Ministry of Health and the private sector for review and feedback."

Blood \ninvestigations, chest radiographs, ECGs and echocardiograms are common in almost all public health facilities. The drugs used to treat HF - diuretics, ACE-I, β-blockers have been approved for use in Malaysia and available in public hospitals as generics.\nThis guideline aims to educate health care professionals on strategies to optimise \nexisting resources in the timely management of patients with HF. \nFacilitators and Barriers:The main barrier for successful implementation of this CPG is the lack of knowledge \nof healthcare providers in the: \n  Diagnosis of HF.\n  Management of HF - initial treatment and long term follow-up.\n  Optimisation of therapy and when to refer to tertiary centres.\nImplementation of the Guidelines:\nThe implementation of the recommendations of a CPG is part of good clinical \ngovernance. To ensure successful implementation of this CPG we suggest:\n  Increasing public awareness of CVD and HF in general and educating them on  \n  the importance of seeking early medical attention.\n  Continuous medical education and training of healthcare providers on the  \n  importance of appropriate management of patients with HF. This can be done  \n  by road shows, electronic media, and in-house training sessions.\nClinical audit by individual hospitals and units to ensure compliance using the \nsuggested performance measures in Section 12, Page 115 and Appendix VI, pg 121.\nDr. Jeyamalar Rajadurai\nChairperson"

(Flow Chart I, Page 28)\n Exercise capacity in a patient with heart disease is assessed by the New York  \n Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification.\n Relevant investigations help to confirm the diagnosis and determine the type of  \n HF and the aetiology.Key message 4: Prevention\n Prevention and early intervention wherever appropriate, should be the primary  \n objective of management. Key message 5: Acute Heart Failure (AHF)\n AHF may present as:\n  Pulmonary and/or peripheral oedema  (“wet” - volume overload)\n  Low output state - shock (“dry” - usually due to pump failure)\n  Combination of pulmonary oedema and a low output state \n The principles of management are:\n  Rapid recognition of the condition.\n  Identification and stabilisation of life threatening haemodynamics.\n  Maintaining oxygenation and perfusion of the vital organs.\n  Relieving clinical symptoms and signs.\n  Identification and treatment of the underlying cause and precipitating/           \n  aggravating factors.\n After initial clinical assessment, management should be instituted as in Flow  \n Chart II, Page 29.\n For grading of recommendations and levels of evidence, see Table 2, Page 30.\nKey message 6: Heart Failure with Reduced Left Ventricular Function (HF rEF)\n Non-pharmacological measures - These include:\n  Education of the patient and family about the disease, treatment options and  \n  prognosis.\n  Encouraging lifestyle measures such as:\n   Regular exercise\n   Avoid adding salt and flavouring sauces such as soya sauce, tomato ketchup  \n   and chilli sauce while cooking or at the table.  \n Fluid intake should be individualised. - A general recommendation is 1-1.5  \n   litres per day in patients with normal renal function.   \n Smoking cessation and avoiding alcohol.\n  Advice regarding sexual activities and pregnancy.\n Pharmacological management:\n  After initial clinical assessment, management should be instituted as in Flow  \n  Chart III, Page 31.  For grading of recommendations and levels of evidence, see Table 3, Page 33.\n  Medications that have been shown to improve survival in HF rEF include:\n  \n Angiotensin converting Enzyme Inhibitors (ACE-I)/ Angiotensin II Receptor  \n   Blockers (ARB) if ACE-I intolerant  \n Angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI)\n   β-blockers\n   Mineralcorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) Device therapy:\n  Cardiac resynchronisation therapy (CRT) can be considered in patients with  \n  all of the following criteria:   \n Sinus rhythm \n   LVEF ≤ 35% \n   Left Bundle Branch Block (LBBB)\n   QRS duration > 150ms\n  An implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) is indicated for secondary  \n  prevention in:  \n Patients resuscitated from sudden cardian death (SCD) due to ventricular  \n   fibrillation or haemodynamically unstable sustained ventricular tachycardia.\n   Prior MI and LVEF ≤ 40% with non-sustained VT AND inducible sustained VT   \n   or VF during an an electrophysiology (EP) study.  \n Patients with chronic HF and LVEF ≤ 35% who experience syncope of   \n   unclear origin.\n Surgery For HF\n  Coronary revascularisation (by either coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) or  \n  percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)) should be considered in patients    with HF and suitable coronary anatomy.\nKey message 7: Asymptomatic LV Dysfunction\n Identify patients who are at high risk of developing LV dysfunction and treat the  \n underlying disease appropriately.\n ACE-I and β-blockers (post MI) have been shown to slow down the onset of  \n symptoms and reduce cardiac morbidity.Key message 8:Heart Failure with Preserved LV Function (HF pEF)\n HFpEF is a common cause of HF in the elderly. \n Hypertension is an important cause and should be treated according to guidelines.\n Management remains empiric since trial data are limited. \n Treat volume overload with diuretics and manage comorbidities.Key message 9: HFrEF in Special Groups\n Diabetes\n  Persons with diabetes are managed in the same manner as persons without  \n  diabetes.\n  When managing diabetes in patients with HF:\n   The sodium-glucose cotransport-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) have been shown  \n   to reduce CV mortality and HF hospitalisations.\n   Saxagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors (DPP-4i) and thiazolidinediones  \n   are best avoided because of a trend towards harm.  \n Sulphonylureas, biguanides like metformin and alpha-glucosidase inhibitors  \n   like acarbose are generally safe.\n Pregnancy\n  The management of HF in pregnancy is more difficult than in the non-pregnant \n  state and should be managed by a multidisciplinary team consisting of physicians, \n  obstetricians and paediatricians.  Patients with LVEF < 30% and those in NYHA Class III and IV should be  \n  strongly advised not to get pregnant. They should be refered to the pre-pregnancy  \n  clinic for advise on the modes of contraception. If pregnant, termination should \n  be considered.  HF that develops during pregnancy can be managed with the judicious use  \n  of diuretics, digoxin, nitrates, β-blockers and/or hydralazine.\n Arrhythmias \n  Arrhythmia-induced HF (also known as Tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy) \n  is a reversible cause of HF.  Successful treatment of the arrhythmia by drug therapy or catheter ablation  \n  can result in normalisation of LV function.\n Cardio-oncology\n  Chemotherapy-induced cardiomyopathy is not common; clinical HF occurs in 1-5%.\n  Close collaboration between the oncologist and the cardiologist is important. \n  Patients undergoing chemotherapy should have a careful clinical evaluation  \n  and assessment and treatment of CV risk factors.\n Chronic Kidney Disease\n  Cardiac and kidney disease frequently co-exist and this increases the complexity \n  and costs of care, and may interact to worsen prognosis.  Management includes the use of intravenous diuretics, careful use of Renin  \n  Angiotensin System (RAS) blockers, β-blockers and occasionally ultrafiltration \n  and haemodialysis. Key message 10: Advanced Heart Failure\nPatients with advanced HF should be referred to assess whether they may be \npotential candidates for mechanical circulatory support (e.g. Left Ventricular Assist Device - LVAD) and consideration for heart transplant. \nPatients with refractory symptoms despite guideline-directed medical therapy, \nshould be considered for palliative and end of life care.\nKey message 11: Organisation of Care\nHeart Failure clinics will serve as an intermediary between in-patient hospital care \nand community primary care."

The prevalence of HF varies between 3 - 20 per 1000 population, although in persons over the age of 65 years, it could be as high as 100 per 1000 population.\n1 \nIn nearly all regions of the world HF is both common and increasing, affecting between 1 - 2% of the population.\n2,3 \nThe main causes of HF amongst adult Malaysians were ischaemic heart disease (68%), valvular/rheumatic heart disease (29%) and non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy (28%).\n4 Vascular risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and                   \ndyslipidaemia were common in Asian HF patients, particularly so in Malaysia (75%, 67%, and 52%, respectively).\n4 In-patient mortality was 6%, with a 30-day readmission \nrate of 30%.4\nHF is an important cause of hospitalisation accounting for about 6% - 10% of all acute medical admissions in Malaysia.\n5,6 \nIt is also an important cause of hospital re-admissions.7,8 About 25% of patients with \nHF are readmitted within 30 days for acute decompensation.7,8 The prognosis for HF \nremains poor. The 1-year mortality rate varies between 5% to 52% depending on the severity and the presence of co-morbidity.\n9,10 With a 5-year mortality at 48%, HF is \ndeadlier than many cancers, for example, colorectal cancer (35.5%), non Hodgkin’s lymphoma (29.6%), and breast cancer (10%).\n9-11 \nThe overall global economic cost of HF in 2012 was estimated at $USD108 billion (MYR 439 billion) per annum.\n12 The economic impact includes both direct and \nindirect costs.12,13 Globally, direct costs accounted for ~ 60% ($USD 65 billion -        \nMYR 264 billion) and indirect costs accounted for ~ 40% ($USD43 billion - MYR 175 billion) of the overall spent.\n12 With an aging, rapidly expanding and industrialising \npopulation this value will continue to rise. \nFor Malaysia, the estimated overall HF costs was $USD 194 million (MYR 785 \nmillion), of which the direct and indirect costs were $USD 12 million (MYR 48.7 million) and $USD 182 million (MYR 740 million).\n12 This is approximately 1.8% of \ntotal health expenditure, with 3.6% GDP spent on health. In general, in most low and medium economies like Malaysia, the indirect costs of HF in terms of premature mortality, morbidity, lost earning potential and unpaid care costs outweigh the direct costs. HF poses a major health and economic burden and an important goal in management is to prevent readmissions, thus reducing both direct and indirect costs.\n12\n1. INTRODUCTION"

        "text": "34This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations to help health care \nproviders in the management of their patients with HF. Beyond the Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG), clinical management needs to be individualised to take into account patient’s overall health goals, values, perspectives and preferences. \nSound clinical judgment plays an important role in formulating appropriate \npatient-centred care plans.\nHF is a clinical syndrome due to any structural or physiological abnormality of the \nheart resulting in its inability to meet the metabolic demands of the body or its ability to do so only at higher than normal filling pressures. This may be accompanied by signs and symptoms of systemic hypoperfusion and/or volume overload. Patients may have typical symptoms (e.g. breathlessness,  ankle  swelling  and  fatigue)  and  signs  (e.g.  elevated  jugular  venous  pressure,  ankle  oedema,  pulmonary  crackles,  and  displaced  apex  beat). Occasionally, some  patients  may  present  without  signs or symptoms of volume overload.\nHF  may  be  the  result  of  any  disorder  of  the  endocardium,  myocardium,  \npericardium  or  great  vessels  although  commonly,  it  is  due  to  myocardial  dysfunction. It may involve only the left and/or right ventricle (RV). \nHF may be classified in many ways. A commonly used classification is by left \nventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). (Table 4, Page 36) This has been shown to have prognostic significance.\n14-16 Furthermore, aetiology, demographic characteristics and \nresponse to therapies differ in the different classes.14,15 \n2. DEFINITION\n3. CLASSIFICATION Key messages 1:\n HF is an important cause of hospitalisation accounting for about 6% - 10% \n of all acute medical admissions and an important cause of hospital  \n readmissions in Malaysia.\n HF costs was estimated to account for approximately 1.8% of total health  \n expenditure."

        "text": "35For practical purposes, HF can also be classified according to the clinical                  \npresentation into:\n Acute heart failure (Acute HF) - defined  as  the  rapid  onset  of  symptoms  and signs   \n of  HF  due  to  an  acute  deterioration  of  cardiac  function in the presence or  \n absence of previous cardiac disease.  \n Chronic heart failure (Chronic HF) - this is a chronic  state  when  patients  have   \n stable  symptoms.  In  these  patients,  an  acute  precipitating  or  aggravating   \n factor(s)  may  cause acute cardiac decompensation.\nThe main pathophysiology of HF is due to a decrease in cardiac output. This will \nresult in the following compensatory mechanisms:\n A higher ventricular end diastolic pressure - This is a compensatory mechanism  \n to increase stroke volume by the Frank Starling mechanism.\n Neurohormonal activation of the: \n  Sympathetic nervous system\n  Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system\n  Vasopressin\nThis neurohormonal activation is aimed at increasing stroke volume and cardiac output by:  An increase in heart rate and ventricular contraction \n  Vasoconstriction of arterial resistance vessels to maintain blood pressure\n  Venous constriction to increase venous preload \n  Salt and water retention to increase preload\nIn general, these neurohormonal responses are compensatory mechanisms. However they can also aggravate HF by increasing ventricular afterload and increasing preload to the point where pulmonary and/or systemic congestion and oedema occur. \nIn the setting of LV myocardial dysfunction, LVEF may be:\n Reduced (LVEF ≤ 40%) - Heart failure with reduced ejection function (HF rEF).  \n Preserved (LVEF ≥ 50%) - Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFp EF). \n Mid-range (LVEF 41%-49%) - Heart Failure with the LVEF being in the mid range  \n (HFmrEF).\n4.

This leads to a cascade of pathophysiological changes as outlined above.  There are effective medical and device therapies that have been shown to have survival benefit in HF rEF. \n4.2 HFpEF\nAbout 50% of  patients  presenting  with  HF  have  normal  systolic  function with  \npredominantly  diastolic  dysfunction.\n7,17,18 Diastolic  dysfunction  leads  to  impaired  \nleft  ventricular  (LV)  filling  due  to  decreased  relaxation (during  early  diastole)  and/or  reduced  compliance  (early  to  late  diastole)  leading  to  elevated  filling  pressures.  These  haemodynamic  changes  are accompanied by predominantly signs of pulmonary and/or venous congestion and occasionally systemic                   hypoperfusion as well. There is limited data available on therapies that improve survival in HF pEF unlike those with HF rEF.\n4.3 HFmrEF\nPatients with HFmrEF have a clinical profile that are closer to those of patients with \nHFpEF than those of HFrEF. This category of patients is poorly studied and their response to therapies is unknown. Data seems to indicate that they have all cause readmission risk that are higher than HFpEF.

These signs are associated with adverse outcomes.19 A \nfourth heart sound is due to atrial contraction and is more frequent in patients with HFpEF. It is absent in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF).\nThese signs may be accompanied by a laterally displaced apical impulse and a \ncardiac murmur. Other supportive signs include peripheral oedema, tachycardia, narrow pulse pressure, pulmonary crepitations, hepatomegaly and ascites. These clinical findings may be transient and resolve completely following initial therapy.\nHowever, these signs are difficult to detect and are not always easily reproducible in \nthe elderly, the obese and in patients with chronic lung disease. Occasionally symptoms and signs of volume overload may be absent and the patient may present with fatigue only.\nIn patients presenting with dysnoea, acute LV failure can sometimes mimic an acute \nexacerbation of bronchial asthma. Thus, a proper history and clinical examination is essential. \nExercise capacity in a patient with heart disease is assessed by the New York Heart \nAssociation (NYHA) functional classification.

If \ndiscontinued, they should be restarted as soon as the condition has stablised. \nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) should be avoided in \npatients with HF.\n204 \nA) Diuretics (Table 10, Page 68)\nDiuretics are indicated in all patients with HF in whom there are signs and \nsymptoms of fluid retention.152\nThe dose of diuretic used is variable and dependent on individual requirements. In the presence of severe congestive HF and in the acute decompensated stage, oral diuretic therapy may be ineffective. Intravenous therapy may be preferred. \nAdequate doses of diuretic should be used. However, these patients should \nbe monitored closely as overdiuresis can cause intravascular volume depletion leading to hypotension and deterioration of renal function.               Hypokalaemia is a common problem with diuretic use and oral potassium supplementation is usually necessary.\nPatient should be educated on ‘dry weight’ management and advised to \nrecord their daily weight. If there is a consistent increase in weight of more than 2kg in 3 days, patients should be educated to self-adjust their diuretic (frusemide) dose together with restriction of their fluid intake until their “dry weight” is regained. However, if the weight increase is associated with worsening symptoms or fails to respond to these measures, the patient should seek medical help immediately.\nThe diuretic of choice in patients with fluid overload is a loop diuretic i.e. \nfrusemide. The goal is a reduction of body weight of about 1kg/day.\nThiazide diuretics may be preferred in patients with hypertensive HF and mild \nfluid retention. For most patients however, a loop diuretic is often required."

All patients with  \n AF should be given an anticoagulant, unless contraindicated.252-257\n Intracardiac thrombus (except for organised mural thrombus).\nJ) Antiarrhythmic Drug Therapy\nArrhythmias are common in HF. The more common ones are:\n Atrial fibrillation \n Ventricular tachyarrhythmias\n Bradyarrhythmias\nJ.1 Atrial fibrillation (AF)New-onset AF in a patient with established HF is associated with a poor \nprognosis irrespective of the LVEF.\n258-260 On the other hand, patients who \ndeveloped AF first, followed by HF usually have a more benign course.259 \nPersistent ventricular rates > 150bpm may cause an arrhythmia induced HF that resolves with rate and/or rhythm control.

However the decision to subject a patient to surgery should take into account the functional status, prognosis and comorbid conditions of the patient. \nSurgical procedures include the following:A) Revascularisation ProceduresPatients with CAD and HF may benefit from revascularisation by either PCI \nor CABG, particularly if they have angina and anatomy that is suitable for revascularisation (left main stem or triple vessel disease). The benefit of revascularisation is likely to be more in patients with more severe left ventricular dysfunction, severe CAD with angina, viable myocardium and reversible ischaemia. The STICH extension trial found a lower risk of total mortality in the CABG group compared to medical therapy in patients with severe HF (LVEF < 35%) and significant CAD, after a median follow-up of 9.8 years.\n325 There was also \na significant reduction in the risk of cardiovascular (CV) death and the combined outcome of all cause death and CV hospitalisations in the CABG group. There was an early risk of mortality following CABG, but benefits of CABG was seen after 2 years, and this benefit in favour of CABG was seen whether viability or angina was present or absent. \nCoronary revascularisation (by either CABG or PCI) should be considered in \npatients with HF and suitable coronary anatomy.\n325\nB) Valve Surgery\nPatients with HF and severe mitral regurgitation, non-ischaemic in origin, \nmay have symptomatic improvement after mitral valve surgery. If the LVEF     < 30%, mitral valve repair is preferred as mitral valve replacement is associated \nwith poorer outcomes.\n326 \nPatients with LV systolic dysfunction undergoing surgical coronary                       revascularisation who also have severe mitral regurgitation secondary to ventricular dilatation may be considered for concomitant mitral valve repair or \nreplacement .\n327,328 In patients with moderate to severe MR and who are not surgical candidates, the use of mitralclip has shown mixed results.\n329,330 \n C) LV Reduction Surgery\nLV aneurysmectomy may be considered in patients with a large discrete LV \naneurysm who develop HF, angina pectoris, thromboembolism, and              tachyarrhythmias due to the aneurysm.\n331 \nPatients with HF undergoing surgical coronary revascularisation, who have areas of LV dyskinesia or akinesia do not benefit from concomitant LV reduction surgery.\n332\n D) LV Assist Devices\nLeft ventricular assist devices have been used to:\n Bridge patients with HF to heart transplant. \n Support patients with acute severe myocarditis with a view to recovery.\n Provide long term haemodynamic support in eligible patients \n (destination therapy).333-335\nPatients awaiting heart transplant who have become refractory to medical \ntherapy and require inotropic support should be considered for a mechanical support device as a bridge to transplant.\n8.3 ASYMPTOMATIC LEFT VENTRICULAR DYSFUNCTION\nThe prevalence of Asymptomatic LV Systolic Dysfunction (ASLVSD) varies \nwith the diagnostic LVEF criteria that is used as a cutoff as well as the population studied. About 0.9-2.1% in the general population have asymptomatic LVEF < 40%.\n336,337 \nPatients with ASLVD (LVEF < 40%) carry substantially higher risk for subsequent morbidity and mortality than the general population. The rate of progression to symptomatic HF was estimated to be 9.7% per year and the risk of death or HF hospitalisation was 8%.\n9,338 Outcomes are worse if effective therapy is \ninitiated after patients develop overt HF.339\nAsymptomatic moderate to severe LV diastolic dysfunction is also common (5.6%) and associated with an adverse prognosis.\n340 There is a higher risk of \nprogression to HF and death when asymptomatic diastolic dysfunction is present, particularly in patients with diabetes and CAD.\n340\nScreening may be done by:341 \n Resting ECG - not very specific or sensitive\n Echocardiography - this is the most specific test\n Natiuretic Peptides (NP) level - may be used to identify individuals who  \n may need an echocardiogram.\nThese screening tests are more cost effective and of greater value when \nused to screen high risk individuals.341-343 These include patients with: \n CAD especially if there is a history of ACS\n Hypertension that has been long standing or poorly controlled\n Diabetes mellitus associated with complications\n Peripheral arterial or cerebrovascular disease\n Excessive alcohol intake\n Metabolic syndrome344 \n Family history of cardiomyopathy\nThe goals of treatment in these patients are to:\n Slow down the progression of the disease \n Prevent the development of symptoms of HF \n Improve survival \nWherever possible, the underlying disease should be treated appropriately to prevent the development of HF. Drug therapy. This includes:\n ACE-I: Long term treatment with an ACE-I has been shown to delay the  \n onset of symptoms of HF and decrease the combined risk of death and  \n hospitalisation.9,338,345,346 \n ARB: There has been no study of the use of ARB in patients with asymptomatic  \n left ventricular dysfunction. The ARB, Valsartan, may be an alternative in   post MI patients who cannot tolerate an ACE-I.\n220 \n β-blockers: In post MI patients and in those with CAD, β-blockers are  \n recommended. They may be considered in all patients with LVEF < 40%.157,347 \n MRA: In post MI patients with diabetes and reduced EF, eplerenone was  \n beneficial.348,349 Eplerenone also reduced the risk of an increase in  \n natriuretic levels post STEMI.350 Diuretics and digoxin: There is no role for these agents in this group of  \n asymptomatic patients. \n Calcium channel blockers: The use of calcium channel blockers with  \n negative inotropic effects is not recommended in asymptomatic post MI  \n patients with LVEF < 40%.351\n8.4 HEART FAILURE WITH PRESERVED LEFT VENTRICULAR SYSTOLIC FUNCTION\nThe prevalence of HF with preserved LV systolic function (HFpEF) varies \nbetween 40-71% depending on the LVEF criteria used as cut off.\n18,352 HFpEF \nconstitutes more than half of HF in older adults and the prevalence is increasing over time.\n18,352 Commonly, these patients are older women who have \nhypertension.\n8.4.1 DiagnosisThe diagnosis of HFp EF is challenging as symptoms and signs can be attributable \nto other co-existing conditions and LVEF is normal. Other co-morbidities that \ncan contribute to dyspnoea in these patients include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and obesity.Criteria that is used to diagnose HF pEF include:\n353,354 \n Clinical signs or symptoms of HF such as exertional dyspnoea, orthopnoea, \n atrial gallop sounds, and pulmonary rales combined with a suggestive  \n chest X-ray and a favourable response to diuretics. \n Biochemistry - Elevated NP.\n Echocardiographic criteria; \n   Preserved or normal LVEF (> 50% or more within 72 hours of the  \n  event) and LV end diastolic volume index (LVEDVI) < 97ml/m2.\n   Left ventricular hypertrophy (increased LV wall thickness or LV mass  \n  index > 115g/m2 for men and > 95g/m2 for women) or left atrial   \n  enlargement (LA volume index > 34ml/m2).\n   Diastolic dysfunction if E/e′ ≥ 13 and the mean e’ septal and lateral  \n  wall < 9cm/s or tricuspid valve regurgitation velocity > 2.8m/s. \n Invasive haemodynamic criteria:\n  Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure > 15mmhg or LV end diastolic  \n  pressure of > 16mmHg indicates elevated LV filling pressures. \n8.4.2 Aetiology and Associated ComorbiditiesDiastolic dysfunction may be due to myocardial or pericardial disease. (See \nTable 14, Page 87).\nHypertension remains the most prevalent comorbidity of HFpEF, with a \nprevalence of 60% to 89% from large controlled trials, epidemiological studies, and HF registries.\n355 \nOther comorbidities include overweight or obesity, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, obstructive sleep apnoea, anaemia, CAD and chronic kidney disease.\n18,352,356\nThe presence of diabetes, a lower systolic BP, haemoglobin and eGFR were associated with a poorer outcome.\n356 \nAF is common in HFpEF and increases risk of adverse outcomes.357\n8.4.3 Management\nThe management of these patients remains empiric, since trial data are \nlimited. Compared with HFrEF patients, hospitalisations and deaths in patients with HFpEF are more likely to be non-cardiovascular. \nThe important aim of therapy is to alleviate symptoms, improve well-being \nand reduce hospitalisations.

However the decision to subject a patient to surgery should take into account the functional status, prognosis and comorbid conditions of the patient. \nSurgical procedures include the following:A) Revascularisation ProceduresPatients with CAD and HF may benefit from revascularisation by either PCI \nor CABG, particularly if they have angina and anatomy that is suitable for revascularisation (left main stem or triple vessel disease). The benefit of revascularisation is likely to be more in patients with more severe left ventricular dysfunction, severe CAD with angina, viable myocardium and reversible ischaemia. The STICH extension trial found a lower risk of total mortality in the CABG group compared to medical therapy in patients with severe HF (LVEF < 35%) and significant CAD, after a median follow-up of 9.8 years.\n325 There was also \na significant reduction in the risk of cardiovascular (CV) death and the combined outcome of all cause death and CV hospitalisations in the CABG group. There was an early risk of mortality following CABG, but benefits of CABG was seen after 2 years, and this benefit in favour of CABG was seen whether viability or angina was present or absent. \nCoronary revascularisation (by either CABG or PCI) should be considered in \npatients with HF and suitable coronary anatomy.\n325\nB) Valve Surgery\nPatients with HF and severe mitral regurgitation, non-ischaemic in origin, \nmay have symptomatic improvement after mitral valve surgery. If the LVEF     < 30%, mitral valve repair is preferred as mitral valve replacement is associated \nwith poorer outcomes.\n326 \nPatients with LV systolic dysfunction undergoing surgical coronary                       revascularisation who also have severe mitral regurgitation secondary to ventricular dilatation may be considered for concomitant mitral valve repair or \nreplacement .\n327,328 In patients with moderate to severe MR and who are not surgical candidates, the use of mitralclip has shown mixed results.\n329,330 \n C) LV Reduction Surgery\nLV aneurysmectomy may be considered in patients with a large discrete LV \naneurysm who develop HF, angina pectoris, thromboembolism, and              tachyarrhythmias due to the aneurysm.\n331 \nPatients with HF undergoing surgical coronary revascularisation, who have areas of LV dyskinesia or akinesia do not benefit from concomitant LV reduction surgery.\n332\n D) LV Assist Devices\nLeft ventricular assist devices have been used to:\n Bridge patients with HF to heart transplant. \n Support patients with acute severe myocarditis with a view to recovery.\n Provide long term haemodynamic support in eligible patients \n (destination therapy).333-335\nPatients awaiting heart transplant who have become refractory to medical \ntherapy and require inotropic support should be considered for a mechanical support device as a bridge to transplant.\n8.3 ASYMPTOMATIC LEFT VENTRICULAR DYSFUNCTION\nThe prevalence of Asymptomatic LV Systolic Dysfunction (ASLVSD) varies \nwith the diagnostic LVEF criteria that is used as a cutoff as well as the population studied. About 0.9-2.1% in the general population have asymptomatic LVEF < 40%.\n336,337 \nPatients with ASLVD (LVEF < 40%) carry substantially higher risk for subsequent morbidity and mortality than the general population. The rate of progression to symptomatic HF was estimated to be 9.7% per year and the risk of death or HF hospitalisation was 8%.\n9,338 Outcomes are worse if effective therapy is \ninitiated after patients develop overt HF.339\nAsymptomatic moderate to severe LV diastolic dysfunction is also common (5.6%) and associated with an adverse prognosis.\n340 There is a higher risk of \nprogression to HF and death when asymptomatic diastolic dysfunction is present, particularly in patients with diabetes and CAD.\n340\nScreening may be done by:341 \n Resting ECG - not very specific or sensitive\n Echocardiography - this is the most specific test\n Natiuretic Peptides (NP) level - may be used to identify individuals who  \n may need an echocardiogram.\nThese screening tests are more cost effective and of greater value when \nused to screen high risk individuals.341-343 These include patients with: \n CAD especially if there is a history of ACS\n Hypertension that has been long standing or poorly controlled\n Diabetes mellitus associated with complications\n Peripheral arterial or cerebrovascular disease\n Excessive alcohol intake\n Metabolic syndrome344 \n Family history of cardiomyopathy\nThe goals of treatment in these patients are to:\n Slow down the progression of the disease \n Prevent the development of symptoms of HF \n Improve survival \nWherever possible, the underlying disease should be treated appropriately to prevent the development of HF. Drug therapy. This includes:\n ACE-I: Long term treatment with an ACE-I has been shown to delay the  \n onset of symptoms of HF and decrease the combined risk of death and  \n hospitalisation.9,338,345,346 \n ARB: There has been no study of the use of ARB in patients with asymptomatic  \n left ventricular dysfunction. The ARB, Valsartan, may be an alternative in   post MI patients who cannot tolerate an ACE-I.\n220 \n β-blockers: In post MI patients and in those with CAD, β-blockers are  \n recommended. They may be considered in all patients with LVEF < 40%.157,347 \n MRA: In post MI patients with diabetes and reduced EF, eplerenone was  \n beneficial.348,349 Eplerenone also reduced the risk of an increase in  \n natriuretic levels post STEMI.350 Diuretics and digoxin: There is no role for these agents in this group of  \n asymptomatic patients. \n Calcium channel blockers: The use of calcium channel blockers with  \n negative inotropic effects is not recommended in asymptomatic post MI  \n patients with LVEF < 40%.351\n8.4 HEART FAILURE WITH PRESERVED LEFT VENTRICULAR SYSTOLIC FUNCTION\nThe prevalence of HF with preserved LV systolic function (HFpEF) varies \nbetween 40-71% depending on the LVEF criteria used as cut off.\n18,352 HFpEF \nconstitutes more than half of HF in older adults and the prevalence is increasing over time.\n18,352 Commonly, these patients are older women who have \nhypertension.\n8.4.1 DiagnosisThe diagnosis of HFp EF is challenging as symptoms and signs can be attributable \nto other co-existing conditions and LVEF is normal. Other co-morbidities that \ncan contribute to dyspnoea in these patients include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and obesity.Criteria that is used to diagnose HF pEF include:\n353,354 \n Clinical signs or symptoms of HF such as exertional dyspnoea, orthopnoea, \n atrial gallop sounds, and pulmonary rales combined with a suggestive  \n chest X-ray and a favourable response to diuretics. \n Biochemistry - Elevated NP.\n Echocardiographic criteria; \n   Preserved or normal LVEF (> 50% or more within 72 hours of the  \n  event) and LV end diastolic volume index (LVEDVI) < 97ml/m2.\n   Left ventricular hypertrophy (increased LV wall thickness or LV mass  \n  index > 115g/m2 for men and > 95g/m2 for women) or left atrial   \n  enlargement (LA volume index > 34ml/m2).\n   Diastolic dysfunction if E/e′ ≥ 13 and the mean e’ septal and lateral  \n  wall < 9cm/s or tricuspid valve regurgitation velocity > 2.8m/s. IIa,B\n Invasive haemodynamic criteria:\n  Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure > 15mmhg or LV end diastolic  \n  pressure of > 16mmHg indicates elevated LV filling pressures. \n8.4.2 Aetiology and Associated ComorbiditiesDiastolic dysfunction may be due to myocardial or pericardial disease. (See \nTable 14, Page 87).\nHypertension remains the most prevalent comorbidity of HFpEF, with a \nprevalence of 60% to 89% from large controlled trials, epidemiological studies, and HF registries.\n355 \nOther comorbidities include overweight or obesity, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, obstructive sleep apnoea, anaemia, CAD and chronic kidney disease.\n18,352,356\nThe presence of diabetes, a lower systolic BP, haemoglobin and eGFR were associated with a poorer outcome.\n356 \nAF is common in HFpEF and increases risk of adverse outcomes.357\n8.4.3 Management\nThe management of these patients remains empiric, since trial data are \nlimited. Compared with HFrEF patients, hospitalisations and deaths in patients with HFpEF are more likely to be non-cardiovascular. \nThe important aim of therapy is to alleviate symptoms, improve well-being \nand reduce hospitalisations. Screening for comorbidities and appropriate interventions of these comorbidities is important. It includes: \n Identifying and treating the underlying cause(s) appropriately. \n  Hypertension should be treated to target goals.55,358 Improved BP  \n  control has been shown to reduce hospitalisation for HF.358 \n  CAD is common in patients with HFp EF and this should be treated  \n  appropriately.\n Tachyarrhythmias should be treated and sinus rhythm restored whenever  \n possible.

Compared with HFrEF patients, hospitalisations and deaths in patients with HFpEF are more likely to be non-cardiovascular. \nThe important aim of therapy is to alleviate symptoms, improve well-being \nand reduce hospitalisations. Screening for comorbidities and appropriate interventions of these comorbidities is important. It includes: \n Identifying and treating the underlying cause(s) appropriately. \n  Hypertension should be treated to target goals.55,358 Improved BP  \n  control has been shown to reduce hospitalisation for HF.358 \n  CAD is common in patients with HFp EF and this should be treated  \n  appropriately.\n Tachyarrhythmias should be treated and sinus rhythm restored whenever  \n possible. If the patient remains in persistent AF, β-blockers or calcium  \n channel blockers (verapamil, diltiazem) alone or in combination are the  \n usual first line agents used for rate control. \n Patients with paroxysmal or persistent AF should be anticoagulated to  \n reduce the risk of thromboembolic events.359,360 Pharmacological options include:   Diuretics: These are necessary to control pulmonary congestion and  \n  peripheral oedema but should be used cautiously so as not to lower  \n  preload excessively and thereby reduce stroke volume and cardiac  \n  output.  β-blockers: This could be given to lower heart rate and increase the  \n  diastolic filling period. At present, however, there is no good demonstration  \n  that β-blockers is beneficial in the treatment of HF pEF.\n226,361 \n  Non-dihydropyridine Calcium Channel Blockers (verapamil and  \n  diltiazem): These may be used to lower the heart rate and has been  \n  shown to be beneficial.362 Verapamil has been shown to improve  \n  functional capacity in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.363\n  ARB trials have shown mixed results. One large trial showed a  \n  reduction in hospitalisation while another large trial was neutral.364,365 \n  ACE-I may improve relaxation and cardiac distensibility directly and  \n  may have long term effects via their antihypertensive action and  \n  regression of hypertrophy and fibrosis. One small study showed an  \n  almost significant trend toward reduction in the primary end point of  \n  combined all-cause mortality and unexpected hospitalisations for HF  \n  while another trial was neutral.366,367 \n  MRA: A large study with spironolactone showed no difference in the  \n  combined primary end point of cardiovascular death, aborted cardiac    arrest, or HF hospitalisation, though there was a reduction in HF  \n  hospitalisation endpoint alone.\n368 Hyperkalaemia was more common  \n  in those on MRA and close monitoring of potassium and renal function  \n  is recommended for those treated with MRA.\n Exercise training: This is safe and improves exercise capacity and quality  \n of life.169 Combined endurance/resistance training appears safe for patients  \n with HFpEF and improves exercise capacity (as reflected by an increase   in peak oxygen consumption), physical functioning score and diastolic  \n function.\n369 It should consist of dynamic isotonic and not static exercise  \n (e.g. walking or cycling).\n The use of an implantable pulmonary artery pressure monitoring system can  \n guide augmentation of diuretic therapy and reduce HF hospitalisations.370"

However the decision to subject a patient to surgery should take into account the functional status, prognosis and comorbid conditions of the patient. \nSurgical procedures include the following:A) Revascularisation ProceduresPatients with CAD and HF may benefit from revascularisation by either PCI \nor CABG, particularly if they have angina and anatomy that is suitable for revascularisation (left main stem or triple vessel disease). The benefit of revascularisation is likely to be more in patients with more severe left ventricular dysfunction, severe CAD with angina, viable myocardium and reversible ischaemia. The STICH extension trial found a lower risk of total mortality in the CABG group compared to medical therapy in patients with severe HF (LVEF < 35%) and significant CAD, after a median follow-up of 9.8 years.\n325 There was also \na significant reduction in the risk of cardiovascular (CV) death and the combined outcome of all cause death and CV hospitalisations in the CABG group. There was an early risk of mortality following CABG, but benefits of CABG was seen after 2 years, and this benefit in favour of CABG was seen whether viability or angina was present or absent. \nCoronary revascularisation (by either CABG or PCI) should be considered in \npatients with HF and suitable coronary anatomy.\n325\nB) Valve Surgery\nPatients with HF and severe mitral regurgitation, non-ischaemic in origin, \nmay have symptomatic improvement after mitral valve surgery. If the LVEF     < 30%, mitral valve repair is preferred as mitral valve replacement is associated \nwith poorer outcomes.\n326 \nPatients with LV systolic dysfunction undergoing surgical coronary                       revascularisation who also have severe mitral regurgitation secondary to ventricular dilatation may be considered for concomitant mitral valve repair or \nreplacement .\n327,328 In patients with moderate to severe MR and who are not surgical candidates, the use of mitralclip has shown mixed results.\n329,330 \n C) LV Reduction Surgery\nLV aneurysmectomy may be considered in patients with a large discrete LV \naneurysm who develop HF, angina pectoris, thromboembolism, and              tachyarrhythmias due to the aneurysm.\n331 \nPatients with HF undergoing surgical coronary revascularisation, who have areas of LV dyskinesia or akinesia do not benefit from concomitant LV reduction surgery.\n332\n D) LV Assist Devices\nLeft ventricular assist devices have been used to:\n Bridge patients with HF to heart transplant. \n Support patients with acute severe myocarditis with a view to recovery.\n Provide long term haemodynamic support in eligible patients \n (destination therapy).333-335\nPatients awaiting heart transplant who have become refractory to medical \ntherapy and require inotropic support should be considered for a mechanical support device as a bridge to transplant.\n8.3 ASYMPTOMATIC LEFT VENTRICULAR DYSFUNCTION\nThe prevalence of Asymptomatic LV Systolic Dysfunction (ASLVSD) varies \nwith the diagnostic LVEF criteria that is used as a cutoff as well as the population studied. About 0.9-2.1% in the general population have asymptomatic LVEF < 40%.\n336,337 \nPatients with ASLVD (LVEF < 40%) carry substantially higher risk for subsequent morbidity and mortality than the general population. The rate of progression to symptomatic HF was estimated to be 9.7% per year and the risk of death or HF hospitalisation was 8%.\n9,338 Outcomes are worse if effective therapy is \ninitiated after patients develop overt HF.339\nAsymptomatic moderate to severe LV diastolic dysfunction is also common (5.6%) and associated with an adverse prognosis.\n340 There is a higher risk of \nprogression to HF and death when asymptomatic diastolic dysfunction is present, particularly in patients with diabetes and CAD.\n340\nScreening may be done by:341 \n Resting ECG - not very specific or sensitive\n Echocardiography - this is the most specific test\n Natiuretic Peptides (NP) level - may be used to identify individuals who  \n may need an echocardiogram.\nThese screening tests are more cost effective and of greater value when \nused to screen high risk individuals.341-343 These include patients with: \n CAD especially if there is a history of ACS\n Hypertension that has been long standing or poorly controlled\n Diabetes mellitus associated with complications\n Peripheral arterial or cerebrovascular disease\n Excessive alcohol intake\n Metabolic syndrome344 \n Family history of cardiomyopathy\nThe goals of treatment in these patients are to:\n Slow down the progression of the disease \n Prevent the development of symptoms of HF \n Improve survival \nWherever possible, the underlying disease should be treated appropriately to prevent the development of HF.

However the decision to subject a patient to surgery should take into account the functional status, prognosis and comorbid conditions of the patient. \nSurgical procedures include the following:A) Revascularisation ProceduresPatients with CAD and HF may benefit from revascularisation by either PCI \nor CABG, particularly if they have angina and anatomy that is suitable for revascularisation (left main stem or triple vessel disease). The benefit of revascularisation is likely to be more in patients with more severe left ventricular dysfunction, severe CAD with angina, viable myocardium and reversible ischaemia. The STICH extension trial found a lower risk of total mortality in the CABG group compared to medical therapy in patients with severe HF (LVEF < 35%) and significant CAD, after a median follow-up of 9.8 years.\n325 There was also \na significant reduction in the risk of cardiovascular (CV) death and the combined outcome of all cause death and CV hospitalisations in the CABG group. There was an early risk of mortality following CABG, but benefits of CABG was seen after 2 years, and this benefit in favour of CABG was seen whether viability or angina was present or absent. \nCoronary revascularisation (by either CABG or PCI) should be considered in \npatients with HF and suitable coronary anatomy.\n325\nB) Valve Surgery\nPatients with HF and severe mitral regurgitation, non-ischaemic in origin, \nmay have symptomatic improvement after mitral valve surgery. If the LVEF     < 30%, mitral valve repair is preferred as mitral valve replacement is associated \nwith poorer outcomes.\n326 \nPatients with LV systolic dysfunction undergoing surgical coronary                       revascularisation who also have severe mitral regurgitation secondary to ventricular dilatation may be considered for concomitant mitral valve repair or \nreplacement .\n327,328 In patients with moderate to severe MR and who are not surgical candidates, the use of mitralclip has shown mixed results.\n329,330 \n C) LV Reduction Surgery\nLV aneurysmectomy may be considered in patients with a large discrete LV \naneurysm who develop HF, angina pectoris, thromboembolism, and              tachyarrhythmias due to the aneurysm.\n331 \nPatients with HF undergoing surgical coronary revascularisation, who have areas of LV dyskinesia or akinesia do not benefit from concomitant LV reduction surgery.\n332\n D) LV Assist Devices\nLeft ventricular assist devices have been used to:\n Bridge patients with HF to heart transplant. \n Support patients with acute severe myocarditis with a view to recovery.\n Provide long term haemodynamic support in eligible patients \n (destination therapy).333-335\nPatients awaiting heart transplant who have become refractory to medical \ntherapy and require inotropic support should be considered for a mechanical support device as a bridge to transplant.\n8.3 ASYMPTOMATIC LEFT VENTRICULAR DYSFUNCTION\nThe prevalence of Asymptomatic LV Systolic Dysfunction (ASLVSD) varies \nwith the diagnostic LVEF criteria that is used as a cutoff as well as the population studied. About 0.9-2.1% in the general population have asymptomatic LVEF < 40%.\n336,337 \nPatients with ASLVD (LVEF < 40%) carry substantially higher risk for subsequent morbidity and mortality than the general population. The rate of progression to symptomatic HF was estimated to be 9.7% per year and the risk of death or HF hospitalisation was 8%.\n9,338 Outcomes are worse if effective therapy is \ninitiated after patients develop overt HF.339\nAsymptomatic moderate to severe LV diastolic dysfunction is also common (5.6%) and associated with an adverse prognosis.\n340 There is a higher risk of \nprogression to HF and death when asymptomatic diastolic dysfunction is present, particularly in patients with diabetes and CAD.\n340\nScreening may be done by:341 \n Resting ECG - not very specific or sensitive\n Echocardiography - this is the most specific test\n Natiuretic Peptides (NP) level - may be used to identify individuals who  \n may need an echocardiogram.\nThese screening tests are more cost effective and of greater value when \nused to screen high risk individuals.341-343 These include patients with: \n CAD especially if there is a history of ACS\n Hypertension that has been long standing or poorly controlled\n Diabetes mellitus associated with complications\n Peripheral arterial or cerebrovascular disease\n Excessive alcohol intake\n Metabolic syndrome344 \n Family history of cardiomyopathy\nThe goals of treatment in these patients are to:\n Slow down the progression of the disease \n Prevent the development of symptoms of HF \n Improve survival \nWherever possible, the underlying disease should be treated appropriately to prevent the development of HF. Drug therapy. This includes:\n ACE-I: Long term treatment with an ACE-I has been shown to delay the  \n onset of symptoms of HF and decrease the combined risk of death and  \n hospitalisation.9,338,345,346 \n ARB: There has been no study of the use of ARB in patients with asymptomatic  \n left ventricular dysfunction. The ARB, Valsartan, may be an alternative in   post MI patients who cannot tolerate an ACE-I.\n220 \n β-blockers: In post MI patients and in those with CAD, β-blockers are  \n recommended. They may be considered in all patients with LVEF < 40%.157,347 \n MRA: In post MI patients with diabetes and reduced EF, eplerenone was  \n beneficial.348,349 Eplerenone also reduced the risk of an increase in  \n natriuretic levels post STEMI.350 Diuretics and digoxin: There is no role for these agents in this group of  \n asymptomatic patients. \n Calcium channel blockers: The use of calcium channel blockers with  \n negative inotropic effects is not recommended in asymptomatic post MI  \n patients with LVEF < 40%.351\n8.4 HEART FAILURE WITH PRESERVED LEFT VENTRICULAR SYSTOLIC FUNCTION\nThe prevalence of HF with preserved LV systolic function (HFpEF) varies \nbetween 40-71% depending on the LVEF criteria used as cut off.\n18,352 HFpEF \nconstitutes more than half of HF in older adults and the prevalence is increasing over time.\n18,352 Commonly, these patients are older women who have \nhypertension.\n8.4.1 DiagnosisThe diagnosis of HFp EF is challenging as symptoms and signs can be attributable \nto other co-existing conditions and LVEF is normal. Other co-morbidities that \ncan contribute to dyspnoea in these patients include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and obesity.Criteria that is used to diagnose HF pEF include:\n353,354 \n Clinical signs or symptoms of HF such as exertional dyspnoea, orthopnoea, \n atrial gallop sounds, and pulmonary rales combined with a suggestive  \n chest X-ray and a favourable response to diuretics. \n Biochemistry - Elevated NP.\n Echocardiographic criteria; \n   Preserved or normal LVEF (> 50% or more within 72 hours of the  \n  event) and LV end diastolic volume index (LVEDVI) < 97ml/m2.\n   Left ventricular hypertrophy (increased LV wall thickness or LV mass  \n  index > 115g/m2 for men and > 95g/m2 for women) or left atrial   \n  enlargement (LA volume index > 34ml/m2).\n   Diastolic dysfunction if E/e′ ≥ 13 and the mean e’ septal and lateral  \n  wall < 9cm/s or tricuspid valve regurgitation velocity > 2.8m/s. \nI,A Invasive haemodynamic criteria:\n  Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure > 15mmhg or LV end diastolic  \n  pressure of > 16mmHg indicates elevated LV filling pressures. \n8.4.2 Aetiology and Associated ComorbiditiesDiastolic dysfunction may be due to myocardial or pericardial disease. (See \nTable 14, Page 87).\nHypertension remains the most prevalent comorbidity of HFpEF, with a \nprevalence of 60% to 89% from large controlled trials, epidemiological studies, and HF registries.\n355 \nOther comorbidities include overweight or obesity, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, obstructive sleep apnoea, anaemia, CAD and chronic kidney disease.\n18,352,356\nThe presence of diabetes, a lower systolic BP, haemoglobin and eGFR were associated with a poorer outcome.\n356 \nAF is common in HFpEF and increases risk of adverse outcomes.357\n8.4.3 Management\nThe management of these patients remains empiric, since trial data are \nlimited. Compared with HFrEF patients, hospitalisations and deaths in patients with HFpEF are more likely to be non-cardiovascular. \nThe important aim of therapy is to alleviate symptoms, improve well-being \nand reduce hospitalisations. Screening for comorbidities and appropriate interventions of these comorbidities is important. It includes: \n Identifying and treating the underlying cause(s) appropriately. \n  Hypertension should be treated to target goals.55,358 Improved BP  \n  control has been shown to reduce hospitalisation for HF.358 \n  CAD is common in patients with HFp EF and this should be treated  \n  appropriately.\n Tachyarrhythmias should be treated and sinus rhythm restored whenever  \n possible. If the patient remains in persistent AF, β-blockers or calcium  \n channel blockers (verapamil, diltiazem) alone or in combination are the  \n usual first line agents used for rate control. \n Patients with paroxysmal or persistent AF should be anticoagulated to  \n reduce the risk of thromboembolic events.359,360 Pharmacological options include:   Diuretics: These are necessary to control pulmonary congestion and  \n  peripheral oedema but should be used cautiously so as not to lower  \n  preload excessively and thereby reduce stroke volume and cardiac  \n  output.  β-blockers: This could be given to lower heart rate and increase the  \n  diastolic filling period. At present, however, there is no good demonstration  \n  that β-blockers is beneficial in the treatment of HF pEF.\n226,361 \n  Non-dihydropyridine Calcium Channel Blockers (verapamil and  \n  diltiazem): These may be used to lower the heart rate and has been  \n  shown to be beneficial.362 Verapamil has been shown to improve  \n  functional capacity in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.363\n  ARB trials have shown mixed results.

Advanced age, duration of the disease, insulin use, the presence of CAD and an elevated serum creatinine are all independent risk factors for the development of HF.\n386\nDiabetes can lead to HF due to:  Coronary atherosclerosis\n   Co-existing hypertension\n  Diabetic cardiomyopathy - this can present as either systolic or diastolic \n  LV dysfunction in an otherwise healthy diabetic person in the absence  \n  of clinically significant coronary, valvular or hypertensive disease.\n387\nThe link between diabetes and HF has been postulated to be multifactorial. In these patients advanced glycation end products, formed by a non-enzymatic reaction between protein and sugar residues, are increased and correlate inversely with left ventricular ejection fraction, the severity of the disease and its prognosis.\n388,389 In addition, other proposed mechanisms include abnormal \ncardiac handling of free fatty acids, decreased myocardial levels of adiponec -\ntin, presence of cardiotoxic inflammatory cytokines and hyperinsulinaemia by itself.\n390 \n8.5.1.1 Diagnosis of HF in diabetes\nDiabetics with HF present in a similar manner as non-diabetics. In diabetics \nthough, dyspnoea may also be a symptom of ischaemia and CAD.\nThe investigative work up is also similar to non-diabetics.    8.5.1.2 Treatment of HF in patients with diabetesConventional therapies for HFrEF are equally effective in both diabetics and \nnon-diabetics. These include:\n   Inhibitors of the renin angiotensin system – ACE-I/ARB.\n214"

Due to chronic adaptation to abnormal haemodynamic state since childhood, many ACHD patients with HF may not report any symptoms or reduced exercise tolerance. Traditional echocardiographic parameters to assess ventricular function (volume, ejection fraction) are not applicable in many situations such as systemic RV or single ventricle. Longitudinal monitoring of individual patients is of paramount importance.\nInvestigations are similar to those mentioned in Section 6, Page 39. \n ECG - baseline abnormalities are common and a change in ECG morphology \n should trigger further investigation.

Additionally, right ventricular \npacing (more evidently at the apical position) may exacerbate HF symptoms, increase hospitalisation for HF and increase mortality.\n439,440 \nIn patients with HF who have bradyarrhythmias and where pacing is indicated, biventricular pacing (CRT) is the pacing mode of choice.\n441"

        "text": "1008.5.5 CARDIO-ONCOLOGY AND HEART FAILURE\nHeart disease and cancer are often linked due to:\n Common risk factors (e.g. increasing age and cigarette smoking)\n Treatment strategies \n  Chemotherapy drugs has been associated with HF, arrhythmias,  \n  vasculitis and thromboembolic disease.\n  Radiotherapy of the mediastinum and left chest can lead to CAD,  \n  myopericardial fibrosis and valvular dysfunction.\nDyspnoea in cancer patients could be due to:\n Fluid overload.\n Cardiomyopathy due to chemotherapeutic agents, stress (Takotsubo), or  \n underlying CAD.\n The primary cancer causing anaemia, lung and pericardial involvement. \nChemotherapy-induced cardiomyopathy is not common, clinical HF occurs in \n1-5% and an asymptomatic decrease in LV function in the range of 5% to 20%.\n442 Prognosis in the patients who develop HF is poor.443\nThe anthracycline class of chemotherapeutic agents remain the major cause of chemotherapy-induced cardiomyopathy.\n444,445 In the current era, newer \nagents have also been implicated in a reversible form of cardiomyopathy.446 \nChemotherapy-induced cardiomyopathy as defined by the Cardiac Review and Evaluation Committee is the presence of at least one or more of the following:\n447\n1. Cardiomyopathy characterised by a decrease in Ejection Fraction (EF)  \n globally or due to regional changes in interventricular septum contraction. \n2. Symptoms of HF.3. Signs associated with HF including but not limited to S3 gallop, tachycardia,  \n or both.4. Decline in initial EF of at least 5% to < 55% with signs and symptoms of  \n HF or asymptomatic decrease in EF of at least 10% to < 55%.\nKey message 9:\n Arrhythmia-induced heart failure (also known as tachycardia-  \n induced cardiomyopathy) is a reversible cause of HF.\n Successful treatment of the arrhythmia by drug therapy or catheter  \n ablation can result in normalisation of LV function.Chemotherapy drugs that have been associated with HF include (Appendix V, Page120):\n Doxorubicin \n  5% at a cumulative dose of 400mg/m2 (the higher the cumulative dose, \n  the greater the risk of HF.445  \n  Even at lower doses of 180 to 240mg/m2, subclinical events can  \n  occur in up to 30% of patients about 13 years post treatment.448\n  These suggest that there is no ‘safe’ dose for doxorubicin. \n Cyclophosphamide especially in high doses and ifosfomide.449,450  \n Newer agents such as monoclonal antibodies (trastuzumab and pertuzumab), \n small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (imatinib, sunitinib, sorafenib)  \n and the proteasome inhibitor (bortezomib).  Trastuzumab especially when administered together with anthracyclines \n  and cyclophosphamide, has been associated with an increased incidence \n  of HF of 27% compared to 1.7% to 4.1% when anthracycline was not part  \n  of the therapeutic regimen.\n451-453 Symptoms are usually mild to moderate \n  and improve following medical management and termination of drug  \n  administration. Improvement is usually seen in about 4-6 weeks after    withdrawal of the agent.\n454-456 After symptomatic improvement, \n  reinstitution  of treatment is usually possible.454-456\n  Vascular endothelial growth factor signaling pathway (VSP) inhibitors  \n  (bevacizumab) can cause hypertension. Bevacizumab also blocks  \n  receptors that are involved in the compensatory response to stress in  \n  the cardiomyocytes and when the heart is unable to compensate for  \n  the hypertension, it could lead to HF.457,458 Maintaining good blood pressure \n  control can prevent HF associated with this agent. Heart failure due to  \n  VSP inhibitors is usually reversible with cessation of the agent.459\nOne must consider both the efficacy and the toxicity in choosing chemotherapeutic agents. Many of the newer targeted agents cause a reversible form of HF and symptoms usually resolve after the initiation of anti-failure medications.\n454-456,459,460 \nRisk factors for anthracycline toxicity include: 461-465\n The total cumulative dose\n Intravenous bolus administration versus infusion\n Higher single doses\n History of prior irradiation\n Use of concomitant agents known to have cardiotoxicity\n Female gender\n Underlying CV disease\n Age (young and elderly)\n An increase in cardiac biomarkers such as troponins during and   after administration is an indication of toxicity.8.5.5.1 Management\n Patients undergoing chemotherapy should have a careful clinical evaluation \n and assessment and treatment of CV risk factors.464,465\n Blood pressure control is important in all patients especially in those  \n being considered for VSP inhibitors.\n All patients with potential cardiotoxic chemotherapy should have an  \n echocardiogram prior to treatment. An important parameter is the LVEF  \n determined using the biplane method of discs (Simpson’s method) or  \n three-dimensional echocardiography where available. Newer techniques   to detect and quantitate regional and global myocardial dysfunction  \n (strain assessment with global longitudinal strain) can be used to detect  \n pre-clinical and subtle changes in function.\n466-469 \n Biomarkers such as troponin and natriuretic peptides can help identify  \n patients at higher risk.462,463,470,471 \nClose collaboration between the oncologist and the cardiologist is important. \nFor the oncologists, the strategy (prior to commencement) includes:465\n Identifying high risk patients (pre-existing heart disease, presence of  \n CV risk factors, age - young and old, female gender, use of high dose  \n anthracycline regimens).\n High risk patients should:\n  Have a pre-treatment cardiac function evaluation. If the LVEF is < 50%,  \n  refer to the cardiologist.  Be considered for non-cardiotoxic alternatives. \n  Have their therapy protocols adjusted where necessary (e.g. reduction \n  in doses, continuous infusions rather than bolus injections, liposomal    doxorubicin, dexrazoxane etc). \nFor the cardiologists/general physicians, the strategy includes:\n Treating CV risk factors. \n Assessing, repeating (if necessary) imaging studies. (e.g. using high  \n quality LVEF measurement, strain evaluation etc).\n Assessing cardiac biomarkers (troponin and/or NP).\n Considering cardio-protection prior to/or during treatment using β-blockers,  \n MRA and/or ACE-I/ARB if:69,465,472-474\n  EF < 50%, \n  EF drops by > 10%\n  Abnormal global longitudinal strain (GLS) (> 15% drop).  Monitoring LVEF during therapy is important with repeat echocardiography  \n at 3-monthly intervals and/or according to symptoms. If cardioprotective  \n medications are given, monitoring may be necessary at closer intervals of  \n time depending on the clinical condition of the patient e.g. 1-monthly interval. \n Withholding cardiotoxic therapy only as a last resort. (for anthracycline  \n LVEF < 45%, for anti-HER2 therapy LVEF < 40%).\n Monitoring even after completion of therapy:\n  Obtain post therapy LVEF.\n  Repeat echocardiography in 6 months or 1 year. Most cases of  \n  treatment-associated cardiac dysfunction develop within the first year  \n  after completion of therapy.475,476 \n  If EF remains abnormal, follow guidelines for management of HF.465 \n \n8.5.6 HEART FAILURE AND KIDNEY DYSFUNCTION\n8.5.6.1 Epidemiology, definitions and classifications Cardiac and pre-existing kidney disease at admission frequently co-exist, \nvarying from 45.4% in patients with chronic HF to > 60% in those with AHF.\n477,478 \nIn addition, during treatment of AHF, a significant proportion of patients will develop varying degrees of worsening renal function (WRF).\nThe definition of WRF is:\n479\n An increase in serum creatinine by ≥ 26.5μmol/ L (0.3mg/dl) and/or\n A ≥ 25% increase in serum creatinine or a ≥ 20% drop in eGFR.\nThe rise in serum creatinine usually occurs in the first three to five days of \nhospitalisation. The incidence of WRF is estimated to be between 19 and 45%.165 This large \nobserved range is due to variations in the definitions of WRF, the observed time-at-risk and the study population.\n165 \nRisk factors for WRF during admission for HF include:480\n A prior history of HF or diabetes, \n An admission serum creatinine of > 133μmol/L,  or \n Systolic blood pressure > 160mmHg. \nWRF may fulfill criteria for type 1 or type 2 cardiorenal syndrome (CRS). The term “cardiorenal syndrome” refers to disorders of the heart and kidneys whereby acute or chronic dysfunction in one organ may induce acute or chronic dysfunction of the other.\n165 \nThis syndrome has been classified by the Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative working group into 5 subtypes as shown in Table 17, Page 105.\n165 Many \npatients however, may belong to more than one subtype and may move between subtypes during the course of their disease.\n165\n8.5.6.2. Pathogenesis of CRS \nMultiple mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of CRS. These include:\n Increased renal venous pressure  - venous congestion is probably the  \n most important factor.481 \n RV dysfunction.\n Reduced renal perfusion with reduced cardiac output. \n Neurohumoral adaptations (e.g. activation of the sympathetic nervous  \n system and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, increases in  \n vasopressin and endothelin-1).8.5.6.3  Clinical significance /Impact of kidney dysfunction in HF  The combination of cardiac and kidney disease increases the complexity and \ncosts of care, and may interact to worsen prognosis. \nA. Pharmacologic considerations \n Safety:\n  Dosing of renally-excreted cardiac drugs need adjustment in the  \n  presence of renal impairment (e.g. digoxin, insulin, low molecular  \n  weight heparin).\n  Patients with HF are at increased risk of contrast-induced acute kidney \n  injury. \n Efficacy:\n  Impaired renal function will affect drug choices and dosing. If eGFR <  \n  30mls/min/1.73m2, most thiazide diuretics are no longer effective and  \n  loop diuretics are preferred. Higher doses of loop diuretics may be   \n  required with increasing renal impairment.             B. Prognostic implications\n Preexisting CKD is a bad prognostic indicator in patients with HF - the  \n more severe the CKD, the worse the mortality.482,483\n In patients with HF, WRF may not always indicate a poor outcome.484 The  \n prognostic value of WRF is mainly determined by:   The presence of persistent congestion  \n  Baseline renal function and magnitude of renal changes \n  Duration - persistent WRF is usually associated with hemodynamic  \n  derangements and poor prognosis as compared with transient WRF  \n  as a result of agressive decongestive therapy.\n485-487\nTable 17: Classification of Cardiorenal Syndrome (CRS)8.5.6.4. Management \n A multi-disciplinary approach is recommended. Early referral to a  \n nephrologist is advisable.   \n Exclude potentially reversible causes for increasing renal dysfunction  \n such as hyper - or hypovolaemia, concomitant medications such as  \n aminoglycosides and NSAIDs, ACE-I or ARB and renal artery stenosis. \n Closely monitor electrolytes and kidney function, especially during acute  \n illnesses, dehydration and when increasing doses of cardiac drugs  \n including diuretics. The baseline renal function will determine how frequently \n this should be done. \n The recommended range for serum potassium is 4-5.5mmol/L.488 \n Wherever possible, avoid nephrotoxins, e.g. contrast media for angiography\n Intravenous diuretics \n  Loop diuretics are the first choice.\n  Continuous infusion may not have greater benefits compared with  \n  bolus dosing.115-118,489\n  Start initially with 2-2.5 times the usual oral dose. \n  Combination therapy (loop diuretic and thiazide/thiazide-like diuretic/\n  mineralocorticoid) may be required to enhance diuresis.205-207 However,  \n  care is required to avoid electrolyte disturbances, hypovolaemia and  \n  worsening renal dysfunction. \n Careful use of Renin Angiotensin System (RAS) blockers  \n  HF patients with stable, chronic mild-moderate renal insufficiency  \n  (eGFR > 30mls/min/1.73m2) should receive standard therapy with an  \n  ACE-I/ ARB and an MRA.490\n  A serum creatinine rise or GFR decrease by up to 30% from baseline  \n  may be acceptable before it becomes necessary to consider stopping  \n  or decreasing doses.221 \n  In patients with advanced renal failure, the decision to start or stop  \n  RAS blockers should be individualised.490\n  Consider withholding RAS blockers during aggressive diuresis in  \n  patients at high risk for WRF.  RAS blockers (and β-blockers) can be used in patients with HF who  \n  are on chronic dialysis therapy.\n Ultrafiltration \n  This involves the removal of plasma water across a semi-permeable  \n  membrane in response to a transmembrane pressure gradient.   It may be considered for congestive symptoms refractory to diuresis,  \n  but should be used in consultation with a nephrologist.\n491\n  Evidence for its efficacy in fluid removal is mixed at present.491  Haemodialysis \n  Criteria for possible need to initiate renal replacement therapy include:\n   Oliguria unresponsive to fluid resuscitation.\n   Severe hyperkalaemia (serum potassium > 6.5mmol/L).\n   Severe acidaemia (pH < 7.2). \n   Serum urea > 25mmol/L. \n    Serum creatinine > 300μmol/L. \n8.6  ADVANCED HEART FAILURE/REFRACTORY HEART FAILURE\nThese are patients with severe symptoms of HF despite maximal medical \ntherapy. Hospital admission is necessary for stabilisation. Meticulous control of fluid balance is important. Aggravating causes of HF as listed in Table 5, Page 39 should be identified and treated.\nThese patients may need specialised treatment in CCU or ICU. The following \nmay be required:\n Intravenous infusion of frusemide. These patients may require combination  \n loop diuretics and thiazides.\n Intravenous infusion of inotropes - low dose dobutamine (5mcg/kg/min) or  \n milrinone. These improve symptoms but no survival benefit has been  \n demonstrated.126,492\n Ultrafiltration in patients who are fluid overloaded.493 In most patients,  \n however, the relief is temporary.\nThe prognosis of these patients is poor. They should be referred to assess \nwhether they may be potential candidates for mechanical circulatory support (e.g. LVAD) and consideration for heart transplant.\n8.6.1 HEART TRANSPLANTHeart transplantation is a well-established treatment of refractory end stage \nHF. This definitive therapy for HF however is limited by the lack of donor organs.\n494,495All patients with severe symptomatic HF despite optimal medical therapy and no other alternative therapy option should be considered for heart transplant. They need to be referred to a HF specialist cardiac hospital for further evaluation.\nAssessment for heart transplant is done by a multispeciality, multidisciplinary \nteam and appropriate work up will be performed for eligibility.\nEligibility criteria to be considered for heart transplant include:\n Poor LVEF (< 25%).\n Recurrent HF hospitalisations.\n Major limitation of the patient’s daily activities.\n Poor effort tolerance i.e. peak VO2 (maximal oxygen consumption or  \n peak oxygen uptake) less than 10ml/kg/min (or < 50% predicted). VO2  \n max is the maximum rate of oxygen consumption measured during  \n incremental exercise ie exercise of increasing intensity and is widely  \n used as an indicator of cardiorespiratory fitness.\n Intravenous inotropic dependence for symptomatic relief or to maintain  \n end organ function.\n Motivated, psychologically stable and compliant to therapy.\nContraindications to heart transplant\n Active infection.\n Severe peripheral arterial or cerebrovascular disease.\n Malignancy within 5 years.\n Diabetes mellitus with widespread microvascular complications.\n Systemic disease with multi-organ dysfunction.\n Irreversible chronic kidney, liver or lung disease.\n Pharmacologically irreversible pulmonary hypertension.\n Other medical or psychosocial issues that would impact survival.\n8.6.2 MECHANICAL CIRCULATORY SUPPORT The use of mechanical circulatory support (e.g. LVAD), should be considered \nfor patients with potentially reversible or treatable conditions or as a bridge to heart transplant in suitable candidates.\nLVAD may also be used as destination therapy in candidates who are not \nsuitable for transplant. Patients have improvement in their symptoms when compared to optimal medical therapy.\n496,497 However, the rate of rehospitalisations \ndue to complications of bleeding, thrombosis and infections are high.496-498 \nMany patients also go into major depression. Thus, extensive discussion with the patient and family is necessary prior to LVAD implantation.8.7 PALLIATIVE AND END OF LIFE CARE\nDespite recent advances in therapy, for some patients, HF remains a \nprogressive disease and carries a poor prognosis. Patients with refractory symptoms despite guideline-directed medical therapy, should be considered for palliative and end of life care if they have the following characteristics:\n499\n Progressive functional decline (mental and physical) and dependence in  \n most activities of daily living.\n Severe HF symptoms with poor quality of life despite optimal pharmacological \n and non-pharmacological therapies.\n Frequent hospital admissions or serious episodes of decompensation  \n despite optimal therapies.\n Heart transplantation and mechanical circulatory support ruled out.\n Cardiac cachexia.\n Clinically judged to be near end of life.\nThe aim of palliative care in HF is to prevent and relieve suffering and to promote the best quality of life for patients and their families.\n500\nDespite the complexities of end-of-life issues in HF patients, there is minimal evidence-based guidance on the care of this population.\n501 The key components \nof end-of-life care are:\n 1. Advanced care plan with directives and informed decisions on:\n   Use or withdrawal of treatment including advanced therapies such  \n   as V inotropes, ICD and mechanical circulatory support. \n   When it would be appropriate to switch off devices such as ICD or  \n   CRT. \n   Resuscitation status.\n   Preferred location of death (i.e. at home or hospital).\n 2. Symptom management \n  Goals of care at this stage should shift from extending life to controlling \n  symptoms and maximising quality of life. Common symptoms include:\n   Dyspnoea\n   Fatigue\n   Pain\n   Urinary retention \n  Constipation\n  Cachexia\n  Depression\n Medications that may be useful include analgesics, antiemetics, anxiolytics,  \n opioids, laxatives, and diuretics, etc. \n3. Psychosocial support\n The impact of HF on quality of life for the patient and family is complex and  \n extends beyond physical symptoms.502\n Emotional, spiritual and social support should be provided to alleviate patient  \n anxiety about dying, and to guide patient towards a peaceful journey at the end  \n of life.\n9.1 LEVEL OF CARE AND SHARED MANAGEMENT \nThe care of patients with HF should ideally take place in a multidisciplinary system, \nallowing for shared care between the hospital (secondary or tertiary settings) and \ncommunity (primary setting). A multidisciplinary approach encompasses patient \neducation, cardiac rehabilitation, psychosocial support and palliative care, and has been proven to reduce HF hospitalisations and mortality in discharged patients.\n503-505\nThe multidisciplinary team usually consists of cardiologists and or general physicians, HF nurses, pharmacists, dieticians, physiotherapists, primary care \nproviders, social workers as well as geriatricians, psychologists, occupational \ntherapists and when necessary, palliative care specialists. Care can be done in two different settings: \n In the patient’s own home - home-based interventions are associated with  \n significantly lower healthcare costs, reduced hospital readmissions and an  \n improvement in the patient’s quality of life.506 This may however, not be feasible  \n in our local setting.\n Specialist outpatient clinic - the Heart Failure Clinic (HFC). \nHFCs can either be:\n Nurse-directed - these are run by nurses with special training in HF.\n Physician-directed - run by general physicians and/or cardiologists. \nHFCs can be established in the tertiary hospitals or in the primary care setting. The minimum human resource requirements are a:\n Cardiologist or general physician with an interest in cardiology and HF, \n Dedicated nurse and \n Medical technologist for blood taking, doing echocardiography and 6 minutes \n walk tests.In bigger clinic settings, the involvement of physiotherapists to encourage physical \nactivity, pharmacists and counsellors for end of life care would be advisable.\nThese clinics will be the intermediary between in-patient hospital care and community \nprimary care. Patients who can be seen in these clinics include those:507\n Recently discharged after an admission for decompensated HF (a waiting \n time of 7-12 days post discharge has to be the maximum wait-time).\n Who are in the early decompensation phase and need treatment modification.\n Who are stable but need uptitration of HF medications.\n With ICD or CRTs. \n With comorbidities, such as renal dysfunction, diabetes and COPD.\n With advanced HF who may benefit from:\n  Heart transplant\n  Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD)\n  Palliative care.\nThe objectives of these HF clinics may vary based on local settings. These include:\n507,508\n Optimisation of medical therapy particularly the uptitration of β-blockers, ACE-I  \n and MRA. \n Education of the patient and caregiver on the nature of the disease and its  \n progression. \n Promotion of self-care such as :\n  Compliance to medical therapy and fluid restriction.\n  Regular weighing and adjusting diuretic doses according to symptoms and  \n  body weight.\nPatient with optimised HF medications/treatment plans can be discharged to the \ncommunity with appropriate care plans to primary care. Close partnership between these HF clinics and primary care helps to reduce unnecessary admissions to hospital. \nIn 2018, the Heart Failure Medication Therapy Adherence Clinic (MTAC) was \nintroduced. These clinics are conducted by pharmacists in collaboration with doctors and other healthcare providers to improve HF management. The objectives of the Heart Failure MTAC are:\n509\n Enhance patient’s adherence to HF pharmacotherapy and non-pharmacological  \n interventions.\n To reduce unscheduled emergency department visits or hospitalisations of HF  \n patient due to acute decompensation.\n To provide consultative service to doctors on evidence-based HF pharmacotherapy  \n and related issues.\n To collaborate with doctors and other health care professionals in HF management  \n program.9.2 MONITORING AND FOLLOW-UP \nPatients with HF require regular follow-up and monitoring. Serial evaluations serve \nto assess a patient’s status, response to therapy, development of complications and disease progression. Key components of assessment include:\n Functional capacity - NYHA functional class or 6-minute walk test \n Fluid status and body weight \n Blood pressure, heart rate and rhythm \n Examination of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems\n Cognitive status and nutritional status \n Review of pharmacotherapy - uptitration, compliance and side effects\n Serum urea, electrolytes, creatinine and eGFR as necessary\n Diet and sodium intake\n Consumption of alcohol or illicit drugs\n Smoking history.\nThe frequency of follow-up will depend on the patient’s clinical stability and need for pharmacotherapy optimisation. A patient with a recent episode of decompensation or clinical instability, for instance, should ideally be seen again soon, usually within 2 weeks. Ultimately, the intensity and type of follow-up would be determined by the local organisation of care and resources.\nRoutine serial echocardiogram is not recommended. However, if there has been a \nrecent change in clinical status or if the patient has received treatment that might significantly change certain echocardiographic parameters, a follow-up echocardiogram is reasonable to assess the LVEF and structural remodeling.\nSerial brain natriuretic peptide measurements to guide and tailor HF therapy cannot \nbe broadly recommended at the present time due to a lack of consistent evidence.\n29-32 \n9.3 CARDIOLOGY REFERRAL \nHF patients with stable symptoms may be managed at the primary care level. \nReferral to the cardiologist should be considered in the following situations: \n De novo HF for a comprehensive workup to confirm the diagnosis and determine  \n the aetiology, and to devise a management plan.\n Episodes of acute decompensation.\n Worsening HF symptoms despite appropriate therapy. \n HF complicated with symptomatic hypotension or excessive bradycardia, limiting \n uptitration of pharmacotherapy. Symptomatic stable CAD and/or acute coronary syndrome for consideration of  \n revascularisation (PCI or CABG). \n Resuscitated cardiac arrest.\n Documented or suspected significant arrhythmias e.g. AF, VT.\n Significant valvular disease not previously assessed or worsening valvular  \n dysfunction.\n Pre-conception assessment and counselling of women with significant structural  \n heart disease and a past history of HF or LV dysfunction. \n Complex congenital cardiac lesions and/or Eisenmenger’s syndrome.\nDespite taking conventional HF therapy, patients may seek alternative therapy and healing approaches that are not considered as allopathic medicine. The National Centre for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) defines complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) as a group of diverse medical and healthcare interventions, practices, products or disciplines that are not generally considered part of conventional medicine.\n10.1 Enhanced External Counter Pulsation (EECP)\nThere is inadequate evidence of clinical effectiveness of EECP in HF.\n510-513 There is \nconcern that it could precipitate or exacerbate HF. \n10.2 Stem cell therapy\nA global position paper on cardiovascular regenerative medicine stated that \ncell-based therapy in HF patients is neither positive nor consistent.514 \n10.3 Omega 3 fatty acids\nIn patients with HFrEF, it may be considered as an adjunctive therapy based on a \nsingle randomised controlled trial (RCT) which showed a small benefit in CV death and/or hospitalisations.\n515,516 10.4 Coenzyme Q10\nThere is no convincing evidence to support or refute the use of coenzyme Q10 for \npatients with HF.517\n10.5 Tai Chi\nTai Chi may improve 6 min walk test distance, quality of life and LVEF in patients with \nHF.518,519 Its effect on hard CV outcomes such as rehospitalisation, MI and mortality \nis not known. \n10.6 YogaA meta-analysis in 2014 that includes two RCTs concluded that yoga improved peak \nVO2 (exercise capacity) and quality of life in chronic HF patients.\n520 There is an \nongoing RCT to look at the effect of yoga in HFpEF patients.521\nThe focus of future development for HF in Malaysia should be towards service \nenhancement working to meet the World Heart Federation mandate of a 25% reduction in premature non-communicable disease mortality by 2025. \nFinding the balance between costs and quality remains a global challenge, and the \nunderstanding of the disease in our healthcare context is imperative to making sure we move forward regarding service delivery, human resource allocation, medical expense costs and patient outcomes. To achieve this, the following need to be undertaken: \n Epidemiological studies to understand the disease profile in the country.\n Establishment and expansion of HFCs leading to more patient-centred HF care.\n Expanding service delivery, human resource allocation, medical expense cost  \n and patient outcomes.\n Education of healthcare personnel.\nEfforts should be directed to the knowledge and understanding of the epidemiology of HF in our country, its phenotype, presentation, current adherence to guideline-directed therapy and outcomes. Regular cluster sampling cohorts or a nationwide registry should be considered. Understanding the limitations of service delivery albeit geography or human resources and making plans for better service delivery systems \nare important.\nDevelopment of HFCs, can lead to a more patient-centric HF care. (See Section 9, Pages 110-113)\nModules for HF care need to be initiated in order to train and educate general \ninternal medicine physicians. A core-curriculum for education needs to be formed to ensure adequate training has been disseminated to HFC personnel.   \nIncentives regarding HF guidelines compliance should be implemented and HF \ninnovative practice should be encouraged with awards for best clinical practice and innovation be made available. \nThis streamline approach to HF care with engagement of connected groups hopefully \nwill help in better overall patient care and experience.\nPerformance measures should be used with the goal of improving quality of care for HF.\n518,519\nProcess performance measures focus on the aspects of care that are delivered to a patient, \nwhile outcome measures focus on the end-points such as mortality or hospitalisation.\nProcess performance indicators for in-patients with HF includes:522-524\n % of patients who had documentation of NYHA Functional Class.\n % of patients who had LVEF measurement.\n % of patients with current or prior LVEF < 40% and without contraindications  \n discharged with ACE-I/ARB. \n % of patients with current or prior LVEF < 40% and without contraindications  \n discharged on β-blockers.\n % of patients with current or prior LVEF < 40% and without contraindications  \n discharged on MRA.\n % of patients with chronic or paroxysmal AF/atrial flutter without contraindications  \n on anticoagulant therapy at discharge.\n % of patients given a post discharge appointment.\nThe accepted performance measure should be more than 60%.Outcome measures indicators include:\n In-hospital mortality\n 30-day readmission for HF\nRefer to Appendix VI, Page 121 for calculation of these measures."

Cardiomyopathy characterised by a decrease in Ejection Fraction (EF)  \n globally or due to regional changes in interventricular septum contraction. \n2. Symptoms of HF.3. Signs associated with HF including but not limited to S3 gallop, tachycardia,  \n or both.4. Decline in initial EF of at least 5% to < 55% with signs and symptoms of  \n HF or asymptomatic decrease in EF of at least 10% to < 55%.\n Chemotherapy drugs that have been associated with HF include (Appendix \nV, Page120):\n Doxorubicin \n  5% at a cumulative dose of 400mg/m2 (the higher the cumulative dose, \n  the greater the risk of HF.445  \n  Even at lower doses of 180 to 240mg/m2, subclinical events can  \n  occur in up to 30% of patients about 13 years post treatment.448\n  These suggest that there is no ‘safe’ dose for doxorubicin. \n Cyclophosphamide especially in high doses and ifosfomide.449,450  \n Newer agents such as monoclonal antibodies (trastuzumab and pertuzumab), \n small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (imatinib, sunitinib, sorafenib)  \n and the proteasome inhibitor (bortezomib).  Trastuzumab especially when administered together with anthracyclines \n  and cyclophosphamide, has been associated with an increased incidence \n  of HF of 27% compared to 1.7% to 4.1% when anthracycline was not part  \n  of the therapeutic regimen.\n451-453 Symptoms are usually mild to moderate \n  and improve following medical management and termination of drug  \n  administration. Improvement is usually seen in about 4-6 weeks after    withdrawal of the agent.\n454-456 After symptomatic improvement, \n  reinstitution  of treatment is usually possible.454-456\n  Vascular endothelial growth factor signaling pathway (VSP) inhibitors  \n  (bevacizumab) can cause hypertension. Bevacizumab also blocks  \n  receptors that are involved in the compensatory response to stress in  \n  the cardiomyocytes and when the heart is unable to compensate for  \n  the hypertension, it could lead to HF.457,458 Maintaining good blood pressure \n  control can prevent HF associated with this agent. Heart failure due to  \n  VSP inhibitors is usually reversible with cessation of the agent.459\nOne must consider both the efficacy and the toxicity in choosing chemotherapeutic agents. Many of the newer targeted agents cause a reversible form of HF and symptoms usually resolve after the initiation of anti-failure medications.\n454-456,459,460 \nRisk factors for anthracycline toxicity include: 461-465\n The total cumulative dose\n Intravenous bolus administration versus infusion\n Higher single doses\n History of prior irradiation\n Use of concomitant agents known to have cardiotoxicity\n Female gender\n Underlying CV disease\n Age (young and elderly)\n An increase in cardiac biomarkers such as troponins during and   after administration is an indication of toxicity.8.5.5.1 Management\n Patients undergoing chemotherapy should have a careful clinical evaluation \n and assessment and treatment of CV risk factors.464,465\n Blood pressure control is important in all patients especially in those  \n being considered for VSP inhibitors.\n All patients with potential cardiotoxic chemotherapy should have an  \n echocardiogram prior to treatment. An important parameter is the LVEF  \n determined using the biplane method of discs (Simpson’s method) or  \n three-dimensional echocardiography where available. Newer techniques   to detect and quantitate regional and global myocardial dysfunction  \n (strain assessment with global longitudinal strain) can be used to detect  \n pre-clinical and subtle changes in function.\n466-469 \n Biomarkers such as troponin and natriuretic peptides can help identify  \n patients at higher risk.462,463,470,471 \nClose collaboration between the oncologist and the cardiologist is important. \nFor the oncologists, the strategy (prior to commencement) includes:465\n Identifying high risk patients (pre-existing heart disease, presence of  \n CV risk factors, age - young and old, female gender, use of high dose  \n anthracycline regimens).\n High risk patients should:\n  Have a pre-treatment cardiac function evaluation. If the LVEF is < 50%,  \n  refer to the cardiologist.  Be considered for non-cardiotoxic alternatives. \n  Have their therapy protocols adjusted where necessary (e.g. reduction \n  in doses, continuous infusions rather than bolus injections, liposomal    doxorubicin, dexrazoxane etc). \nFor the cardiologists/general physicians, the strategy includes:\n Treating CV risk factors. \n Assessing, repeating (if necessary) imaging studies. (e.g. using high  \n quality LVEF measurement, strain evaluation etc).\n Assessing cardiac biomarkers (troponin and/or NP).\n Considering cardio-protection prior to/or during treatment using β-blockers,  \n MRA and/or ACE-I/ARB if:69,465,472-474\n  EF < 50%, \n  EF drops by > 10%\n  Abnormal global longitudinal strain (GLS) (> 15% drop).  Monitoring LVEF during therapy is important with repeat echocardiography  \n at 3-monthly intervals and/or according to symptoms. If cardioprotective  \n medications are given, monitoring may be necessary at closer intervals of  \n time depending on the clinical condition of the patient e.g. 1-monthly interval. \n Withholding cardiotoxic therapy only as a last resort. (for anthracycline  \n LVEF < 45%, for anti-HER2 therapy LVEF < 40%).\n Monitoring even after completion of therapy:\n  Obtain post therapy LVEF.\n  Repeat echocardiography in 6 months or 1 year. Most cases of  \n  treatment-associated cardiac dysfunction develop within the first year  \n  after completion of therapy.475,476 \n  If EF remains abnormal, follow guidelines for management of HF.465 \n \n8.5.6 HEART FAILURE AND KIDNEY DYSFUNCTION\n8.5.6.1 Epidemiology, definitions and classifications Cardiac and pre-existing kidney disease at admission frequently co-exist, \nvarying from 45.4% in patients with chronic HF to > 60% in those with AHF.\n477,478 \nIn addition, during treatment of AHF, a significant proportion of patients will develop varying degrees of worsening renal function (WRF).\nThe definition of WRF is:\n479\n An increase in serum creatinine by ≥ 26.5μmol/ L (0.3mg/dl) and/or\n A ≥ 25% increase in serum creatinine or a ≥ 20% drop in eGFR.\nThe rise in serum creatinine usually occurs in the first three to five days of \nhospitalisation. The incidence of WRF is estimated to be between 19 and 45%.165 This large \nobserved range is due to variations in the definitions of WRF, the observed time-at-risk and the study population.\n165 \nRisk factors for WRF during admission for HF include:480\n A prior history of HF or diabetes, \n An admission serum creatinine of > 133μmol/L,  or \n Systolic blood pressure > 160mmHg. \nWRF may fulfill criteria for type 1 or type 2 cardiorenal syndrome (CRS). The term “cardiorenal syndrome” refers to disorders of the heart and kidneys whereby acute or chronic dysfunction in one organ may induce acute or chronic dysfunction of the other.\n165 \nThis syndrome has been classified by the Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative working group into 5 subtypes as shown in Table 17, Page 105.\n165 Many \npatients however, may belong to more than one subtype and may move between subtypes during the course of their disease.\n165\n8.5.6.2. Pathogenesis of CRS \nMultiple mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of CRS. These include:\n Increased renal venous pressure  - venous congestion is probably the  \n most important factor.481 \n RV dysfunction.\n Reduced renal perfusion with reduced cardiac output. \n Neurohumoral adaptations (e.g. activation of the sympathetic nervous  \n system and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, increases in  \n vasopressin and endothelin-1).8.5.6.3  Clinical significance /Impact of kidney dysfunction in HF  The combination of cardiac and kidney disease increases the complexity and \ncosts of care, and may interact to worsen prognosis. \nA. Pharmacologic considerations \n Safety:\n  Dosing of renally-excreted cardiac drugs need adjustment in the  \n  presence of renal impairment (e.g. digoxin, insulin, low molecular  \n  weight heparin).\n  Patients with HF are at increased risk of contrast-induced acute kidney \n  injury. \n Efficacy:\n  Impaired renal function will affect drug choices and dosing. If eGFR <  \n  30mls/min/1.73m2, most thiazide diuretics are no longer effective and  \n  loop diuretics are preferred. Higher doses of loop diuretics may be   \n  required with increasing renal impairment.             B. Prognostic implications\n Preexisting CKD is a bad prognostic indicator in patients with HF - the  \n more severe the CKD, the worse the mortality.482,483\n In patients with HF, WRF may not always indicate a poor outcome.484 The  \n prognostic value of WRF is mainly determined by:   The presence of persistent congestion  \n  Baseline renal function and magnitude of renal changes \n  Duration - persistent WRF is usually associated with hemodynamic  \n  derangements and poor prognosis as compared with transient WRF  \n  as a result of agressive decongestive therapy.\n485-487\nTable 17: Classification of Cardiorenal Syndrome (CRS)8.5.6.4. Management \n A multi-disciplinary approach is recommended. Early referral to a  \n nephrologist is advisable.   \n Exclude potentially reversible causes for increasing renal dysfunction  \n such as hyper - or hypovolaemia, concomitant medications such as  \n aminoglycosides and NSAIDs, ACE-I or ARB and renal artery stenosis. \n Closely monitor electrolytes and kidney function, especially during acute  \n illnesses, dehydration and when increasing doses of cardiac drugs  \n including diuretics. The baseline renal function will determine how frequently \n this should be done. \n The recommended range for serum potassium is 4-5.5mmol/L.488 \n Wherever possible, avoid nephrotoxins, e.g. contrast media for angiography\n Intravenous diuretics \n  Loop diuretics are the first choice.\n  Continuous infusion may not have greater benefits compared with  \n  bolus dosing.115-118,489\n  Start initially with 2-2.5 times the usual oral dose. \n  Combination therapy (loop diuretic and thiazide/thiazide-like diuretic/\n  mineralocorticoid) may be required to enhance diuresis.205-207 However,  \n  care is required to avoid electrolyte disturbances, hypovolaemia and  \n  worsening renal dysfunction. \n Careful use of Renin Angiotensin System (RAS) blockers  \n  HF patients with stable, chronic mild-moderate renal insufficiency  \n  (eGFR > 30mls/min/1.73m2) should receive standard therapy with an  \n  ACE-I/ ARB and an MRA.490\n  A serum creatinine rise or GFR decrease by up to 30% from baseline  \n  may be acceptable before it becomes necessary to consider stopping  \n  or decreasing doses.221 \n  In patients with advanced renal failure, the decision to start or stop  \n  RAS blockers should be individualised.490\n  Consider withholding RAS blockers during aggressive diuresis in  \n  patients at high risk for WRF.  RAS blockers (and β-blockers) can be used in patients with HF who  \n  are on chronic dialysis therapy.\n Ultrafiltration \n  This involves the removal of plasma water across a semi-permeable  \n  membrane in response to a transmembrane pressure gradient.   It may be considered for congestive symptoms refractory to diuresis,  \n  but should be used in consultation with a nephrologist.\n491\n  Evidence for its efficacy in fluid removal is mixed at present.491  Haemodialysis \n  Criteria for possible need to initiate renal replacement therapy include:\n   Oliguria unresponsive to fluid resuscitation.\n   Severe hyperkalaemia (serum potassium > 6.5mmol/L).\n   Severe acidaemia (pH < 7.2). \n   Serum urea > 25mmol/L. \n    Serum creatinine > 300μmol/L. \n8.6  ADVANCED HEART FAILURE/REFRACTORY HEART FAILURE\nThese are patients with severe symptoms of HF despite maximal medical \ntherapy. Hospital admission is necessary for stabilisation. Meticulous control of fluid balance is important. Aggravating causes of HF as listed in Table 5, Page 39 should be identified and treated.\nThese patients may need specialised treatment in CCU or ICU. The following \nmay be required:\n Intravenous infusion of frusemide. These patients may require combination  \n loop diuretics and thiazides.\n Intravenous infusion of inotropes - low dose dobutamine (5mcg/kg/min) or  \n milrinone. These improve symptoms but no survival benefit has been  \n demonstrated.126,492\n Ultrafiltration in patients who are fluid overloaded.493 In most patients,  \n however, the relief is temporary.\nThe prognosis of these patients is poor. They should be referred to assess \nwhether they may be potential candidates for mechanical circulatory support \n(e.g. LVAD) and consideration for heart transplant.\n8.6.1 HEART TRANSPLANTHeart transplantation is a well-established treatment of refractory end stage \nHF. This definitive therapy for HF however is limited by the lack of donor organs.\n494,495All patients with severe symptomatic HF despite optimal medical therapy and no other alternative therapy option should be considered for heart transplant. They need to be referred to a HF specialist cardiac hospital for further evaluation.\nAssessment for heart transplant is done by a multispeciality, multidisciplinary \nteam and appropriate work up will be performed for eligibility.\nEligibility criteria to be considered for heart transplant include:\n Poor LVEF (< 25%).\n Recurrent HF hospitalisations.\n Major limitation of the patient’s daily activities.\n Poor effort tolerance i.e. peak VO2 (maximal oxygen consumption or  \n peak oxygen uptake) less than 10ml/kg/min (or < 50% predicted). VO2  \n max is the maximum rate of oxygen consumption measured during  \n incremental exercise ie exercise of increasing intensity and is widely  \n used as an indicator of cardiorespiratory fitness.\n Intravenous inotropic dependence for symptomatic relief or to maintain  \n end organ function.\n Motivated, psychologically stable and compliant to therapy.\nContraindications to heart transplant\n Active infection.\n Severe peripheral arterial or cerebrovascular disease.\n Malignancy within 5 years.\n Diabetes mellitus with widespread microvascular complications.\n Systemic disease with multi-organ dysfunction.\n Irreversible chronic kidney, liver or lung disease.\n Pharmacologically irreversible pulmonary hypertension.\n Other medical or psychosocial issues that would impact survival.\n8.6.2 MECHANICAL CIRCULATORY SUPPORT The use of mechanical circulatory support (e.g. LVAD), should be considered \nfor patients with potentially reversible or treatable conditions or as a bridge to heart transplant in suitable candidates.\nLVAD may also be used as destination therapy in candidates who are not \nsuitable for transplant. Patients have improvement in their symptoms when compared to optimal medical therapy.\n496,497 However, the rate of rehospitalisations \ndue to complications of bleeding, thrombosis and infections are high.496-498 \nMany patients also go into major depression. Thus, extensive discussion with the patient and family is necessary prior to LVAD implantation.8.7 PALLIATIVE AND END OF LIFE CARE\nDespite recent advances in therapy, for some patients, HF remains a \nprogressive disease and carries a poor prognosis. Patients with refractory symptoms despite guideline-directed medical therapy, should be considered for palliative and end of life care if they have the following characteristics:\n499\n Progressive functional decline (mental and physical) and dependence in  \n most activities of daily living.\n Severe HF symptoms with poor quality of life despite optimal pharmacological \n and non-pharmacological therapies.\n Frequent hospital admissions or serious episodes of decompensation  \n despite optimal therapies.\n Heart transplantation and mechanical circulatory support ruled out.\n Cardiac cachexia.\n Clinically judged to be near end of life.\nThe aim of palliative care in HF is to prevent and relieve suffering and to promote the best quality of life for patients and their families.\n500\nDespite the complexities of end-of-life issues in HF patients, there is minimal evidence-based guidance on the care of this population.\n501 The key components \nof end-of-life care are:\n 1. Advanced care plan with directives and informed decisions on:\n   Use or withdrawal of treatment including advanced therapies such  \n   as V inotropes, ICD and mechanical circulatory support. \n   When it would be appropriate to switch off devices such as ICD or  \n   CRT. \n   Resuscitation status.\n   Preferred location of death (i.e. at home or hospital).\n 2. Symptom management \n  Goals of care at this stage should shift from extending life to controlling \n  symptoms and maximising quality of life. Common symptoms include:\n   Dyspnoea\n   Fatigue\n   Pain\n   Urinary retention \n  Constipation\n  Cachexia\n  Depression\n Medications that may be useful include analgesics, antiemetics, anxiolytics,  \n opioids, laxatives, and diuretics, etc. \n3. Psychosocial support\n The impact of HF on quality of life for the patient and family is complex and  \n extends beyond physical symptoms.502\n Emotional, spiritual and social support should be provided to alleviate patient  \n anxiety about dying, and to guide patient towards a peaceful journey at the end  \n of life.\n9.1 LEVEL OF CARE AND SHARED MANAGEMENT \nThe care of patients with HF should ideally take place in a multidisciplinary system, \nallowing for shared care between the hospital (secondary or tertiary settings) and \ncommunity (primary setting). A multidisciplinary approach encompasses patient \neducation, cardiac rehabilitation, psychosocial support and palliative care, and has been proven to reduce HF hospitalisations and mortality in discharged patients.\n503-505\nThe multidisciplinary team usually consists of cardiologists and or general physicians, HF nurses, pharmacists, dieticians, physiotherapists, primary care \nproviders, social workers as well as geriatricians, psychologists, occupational \ntherapists and when necessary, palliative care specialists. Care can be done in two different settings: \n In the patient’s own home - home-based interventions are associated with  \n significantly lower healthcare costs, reduced hospital readmissions and an  \n improvement in the patient’s quality of life.506 This may however, not be feasible  \n in our local setting.\n Specialist outpatient clinic - the Heart Failure Clinic (HFC). \nHFCs can either be:\n Nurse-directed - these are run by nurses with special training in HF.\n Physician-directed - run by general physicians and/or cardiologists. \nHFCs can be established in the tertiary hospitals or in the primary care setting. The minimum human resource requirements are a:\n Cardiologist or general physician with an interest in cardiology and HF, \n Dedicated nurse and \n Medical technologist for blood taking, doing echocardiography and 6 minutes \n walk tests.In bigger clinic settings, the involvement of physiotherapists to encourage physical \nactivity, pharmacists and counsellors for end of life care would be advisable.\nThese clinics will be the intermediary between in-patient hospital care and community \nprimary care. Patients who can be seen in these clinics include those:507\n Recently discharged after an admission for decompensated HF (a waiting \n time of 7-12 days post discharge has to be the maximum wait-time).\n Who are in the early decompensation phase and need treatment modification.\n Who are stable but need uptitration of HF medications.\n With ICD or CRTs. \n With comorbidities, such as renal dysfunction, diabetes and COPD.\n With advanced HF who may benefit from:\n  Heart transplant\n  Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD)\n  Palliative care.\nThe objectives of these HF clinics may vary based on local settings. These include:\n507,508\n Optimisation of medical therapy particularly the uptitration of β-blockers, ACE-I  \n and MRA. \n Education of the patient and caregiver on the nature of the disease and its  \n progression. \n Promotion of self-care such as :\n  Compliance to medical therapy and fluid restriction.\n  Regular weighing and adjusting diuretic doses according to symptoms and  \n  body weight.\nPatient with optimised HF medications/treatment plans can be discharged to the \ncommunity with appropriate care plans to primary care. Close partnership between these HF clinics and primary care helps to reduce unnecessary admissions to hospital. \nIn 2018, the Heart Failure Medication Therapy Adherence Clinic (MTAC) was \nintroduced. These clinics are conducted by pharmacists in collaboration with doctors and other healthcare providers to improve HF management. The objectives of the Heart Failure MTAC are:\n509\n Enhance patient’s adherence to HF pharmacotherapy and non-pharmacological  \n interventions.\n To reduce unscheduled emergency department visits or hospitalisations of HF  \n patient due to acute decompensation.\n To provide consultative service to doctors on evidence-based HF pharmacotherapy  \n and related issues.\n To collaborate with doctors and other health care professionals in HF management  \n program.9.2 MONITORING AND FOLLOW-UP \nPatients with HF require regular follow-up and monitoring. Serial evaluations serve \nto assess a patient’s status, response to therapy, development of complications and disease progression. Key components of assessment include:\n Functional capacity - NYHA functional class or 6-minute walk test \n Fluid status and body weight \n Blood pressure, heart rate and rhythm \n Examination of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems\n Cognitive status and nutritional status \n Review of pharmacotherapy - uptitration, compliance and side effects\n Serum urea, electrolytes, creatinine and eGFR as necessary\n Diet and sodium intake\n Consumption of alcohol or illicit drugs\n Smoking history.\nThe frequency of follow-up will depend on the patient’s clinical stability and need for pharmacotherapy optimisation. A patient with a recent episode of decompensation or clinical instability, for instance, should ideally be seen again soon, usually within 2 weeks. Ultimately, the intensity and type of follow-up would be determined by the local organisation of care and resources.\nRoutine serial echocardiogram is not recommended. However, if there has been a \nrecent change in clinical status or if the patient has received treatment that might significantly change certain echocardiographic parameters, a follow-up echocardiogram is reasonable to assess the LVEF and structural remodeling.\nSerial brain natriuretic peptide measurements to guide and tailor HF therapy cannot \nbe broadly recommended at the present time due to a lack of consistent evidence.\n29-32 \n9.3 CARDIOLOGY REFERRAL \nHF patients with stable symptoms may be managed at the primary care level. \nReferral to the cardiologist should be considered in the following situations: \n De novo HF for a comprehensive workup to confirm the diagnosis and determine  \n the aetiology, and to devise a management plan.\n Episodes of acute decompensation.\n Worsening HF symptoms despite appropriate therapy. \n HF complicated with symptomatic hypotension or excessive bradycardia, limiting \n uptitration of pharmacotherapy. Symptomatic stable CAD and/or acute coronary syndrome for consideration of  \n revascularisation (PCI or CABG). \n Resuscitated cardiac arrest.\n Documented or suspected significant arrhythmias e.g. AF, VT.\n Significant valvular disease not previously assessed or worsening valvular  \n dysfunction.\n Pre-conception assessment and counselling of women with significant structural  \n heart disease and a past history of HF or LV dysfunction. \n Complex congenital cardiac lesions and/or Eisenmenger’s syndrome.\nDespite taking conventional HF therapy, patients may seek alternative therapy and healing approaches that are not considered as allopathic medicine. The National Centre for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) defines complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) as a group of diverse medical and healthcare interventions, practices, products or disciplines that are not generally considered part of conventional medicine.\n10.1 Enhanced External Counter Pulsation (EECP)\nThere is inadequate evidence of clinical effectiveness of EECP in HF.\n510-513 There is \nconcern that it could precipitate or exacerbate HF. \n10.2 Stem cell therapy\nA global position paper on cardiovascular regenerative medicine stated that \ncell-based therapy in HF patients is neither positive nor consistent.514 \n10.3 Omega 3 fatty acids\nIn patients with HFrEF, it may be considered as an adjunctive therapy based on a \nsingle randomised controlled trial (RCT) which showed a small benefit in CV death and/or hospitalisations.\n515,516 10.4 Coenzyme Q10\nThere is no convincing evidence to support or refute the use of coenzyme Q10 for \npatients with HF.517\n10.5 Tai Chi\nTai Chi may improve 6 min walk test distance, quality of life and LVEF in patients with \nHF.518,519 Its effect on hard CV outcomes such as rehospitalisation, MI and mortality \nis not known. \n10.6 YogaA meta-analysis in 2014 that includes two RCTs concluded that yoga improved peak \nVO2 (exercise capacity) and quality of life in chronic HF patients.\n520 There is an \nongoing RCT to look at the effect of yoga in HFpEF patients.521\nThe focus of future development for HF in Malaysia should be towards service \nenhancement working to meet the World Heart Federation mandate of a 25% reduction in premature non-communicable disease mortality by 2025. \nFinding the balance between costs and quality remains a global challenge, and the \nunderstanding of the disease in our healthcare context is imperative to making sure we move forward regarding service delivery, human resource allocation, medical \nexpense costs and patient outcomes. To achieve this, the following need to be undertaken: \n Epidemiological studies to understand the disease profile in the country.\n Establishment and expansion of HFCs leading to more patient-centred HF care.\n Expanding service delivery, human resource allocation, medical expense cost  \n and patient outcomes.\n Education of healthcare personnel.\nEfforts should be directed to the knowledge and understanding of the epidemiology of HF in our country, its phenotype, presentation, current adherence to guideline-directed therapy and outcomes. Regular cluster sampling cohorts or a nationwide registry should be considered. Understanding the limitations of service delivery albeit geography or human resources and making plans for better service delivery systems \nare important.\nDevelopment of HFCs, can lead to a more patient-centric HF care. (See Section 9, Pages 110-113)\nModules for HF care need to be initiated in order to train and educate general \ninternal medicine physicians. A core-curriculum for education needs to be formed to ensure adequate training has been disseminated to HFC personnel.   \nIncentives regarding HF guidelines compliance should be implemented and HF \ninnovative practice should be encouraged with awards for best clinical practice and innovation be made available. \nThis streamline approach to HF care with engagement of connected groups hopefully \nwill help in better overall patient care and experience.\nPerformance measures should be used with the goal of improving quality of care for HF.\n518,519\nProcess performance measures focus on the aspects of care that are delivered to a patient, \nwhile outcome measures focus on the end-points such as mortality or hospitalisation.\nProcess performance indicators for in-patients with HF includes:522-524\n % of patients who had documentation of NYHA Functional Class.\n % of patients who had LVEF measurement.\n % of patients with current or prior LVEF < 40% and without contraindications  \n discharged with ACE-I/ARB. \n % of patients with current or prior LVEF < 40% and without contraindications  \n discharged on β-blockers.\n % of patients with current or prior LVEF < 40% and without contraindications  \n discharged on MRA.\n % of patients with chronic or paroxysmal AF/atrial flutter without contraindications  \n on anticoagulant therapy at discharge.\n % of patients given a post discharge appointment.\nThe accepted performance measure should be more than 60%.Outcome measures indicators include:\n In-hospital mortality\n 30-day readmission for HF\nRefer to Appendix VI, Page 121 for calculation of these measures."

Cardiomyopathy characterised by a decrease in Ejection Fraction (EF)  \n globally or due to regional changes in interventricular septum contraction. \n2. Symptoms of HF.3. Signs associated with HF including but not limited to S3 gallop, tachycardia,  \n or both.4. Decline in initial EF of at least 5% to < 55% with signs and symptoms of  \n HF or asymptomatic decrease in EF of at least 10% to < 55%.Chemotherapy drugs that have been associated with HF include (Appendix V, Page120):\n Doxorubicin \n  5% at a cumulative dose of 400mg/m2 (the higher the cumulative dose, \n  the greater the risk of HF.445  \n  Even at lower doses of 180 to 240mg/m2, subclinical events can  \n  occur in up to 30% of patients about 13 years post treatment.448\n  These suggest that there is no ‘safe’ dose for doxorubicin. \n Cyclophosphamide especially in high doses and ifosfomide.449,450  \n Newer agents such as monoclonal antibodies (trastuzumab and pertuzumab), \n small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (imatinib, sunitinib, sorafenib)  \n and the proteasome inhibitor (bortezomib).  Trastuzumab especially when administered together with anthracyclines \n  and cyclophosphamide, has been associated with an increased incidence \n  of HF of 27% compared to 1.7% to 4.1% when anthracycline was not part  \n  of the therapeutic regimen.\n451-453 Symptoms are usually mild to moderate \n  and improve following medical management and termination of drug  \n  administration. Improvement is usually seen in about 4-6 weeks after    withdrawal of the agent.\n454-456 After symptomatic improvement, \n  reinstitution  of treatment is usually possible.454-456\n  Vascular endothelial growth factor signaling pathway (VSP) inhibitors  \n  (bevacizumab) can cause hypertension. Bevacizumab also blocks  \n  receptors that are involved in the compensatory response to stress in  \n  the cardiomyocytes and when the heart is unable to compensate for  \n  the hypertension, it could lead to HF.457,458 Maintaining good blood pressure \n  control can prevent HF associated with this agent. Heart failure due to  \n  VSP inhibitors is usually reversible with cessation of the agent.459\nOne must consider both the efficacy and the toxicity in choosing chemotherapeutic agents. Many of the newer targeted agents cause a reversible form of HF and symptoms usually resolve after the initiation of anti-failure medications.\n454-456,459,460 \nRisk factors for anthracycline toxicity include: 461-465\n The total cumulative dose\n Intravenous bolus administration versus infusion\n Higher single doses\n History of prior irradiation\n Use of concomitant agents known to have cardiotoxicity\n Female gender\n Underlying CV disease\n Age (young and elderly)\n An increase in cardiac biomarkers such as troponins during and   after administration is an indication of toxicity.8.5.5.1 Management\n Patients undergoing chemotherapy should have a careful clinical evaluation \n and assessment and treatment of CV risk factors.464,465\n Blood pressure control is important in all patients especially in those  \n being considered for VSP inhibitors.\n All patients with potential cardiotoxic chemotherapy should have an  \n echocardiogram prior to treatment. An important parameter is the LVEF  \n determined using the biplane method of discs (Simpson’s method) or  \n three-dimensional echocardiography where available. Newer techniques  \n to detect and quantitate regional and global myocardial dysfunction  \n (strain assessment with global longitudinal strain) can be used to detect  \n pre-clinical and subtle changes in function.466-469 \n Biomarkers such as troponin and natriuretic peptides can help identify  \n patients at higher risk.462,463,470,471 \nClose collaboration between the oncologist and the cardiologist is important. \nFor the oncologists, the strategy (prior to commencement) includes:465\n Identifying high risk patients (pre-existing heart disease, presence of  \n CV risk factors, age - young and old, female gender, use of high dose  \n anthracycline regimens).\n High risk patients should:\n  Have a pre-treatment cardiac function evaluation. If the LVEF is < 50%,  \n  refer to the cardiologist.  Be considered for non-cardiotoxic alternatives. \n  Have their therapy protocols adjusted where necessary (e.g. reduction \n  in doses, continuous infusions rather than bolus injections, liposomal    doxorubicin, dexrazoxane etc). \nFor the cardiologists/general physicians, the strategy includes:\n Treating CV risk factors. \n Assessing, repeating (if necessary) imaging studies. (e.g. using high  \n quality LVEF measurement, strain evaluation etc).\n Assessing cardiac biomarkers (troponin and/or NP).\n Considering cardio-protection prior to/or during treatment using β-blockers,  \n MRA and/or ACE-I/ARB if:69,465,472-474\n  EF < 50%, \n  EF drops by > 10%\n  Abnormal global longitudinal strain (GLS) (> 15% drop).  Monitoring LVEF during therapy is important with repeat echocardiography  \n at 3-monthly intervals and/or according to symptoms. If cardioprotective  \n medications are given, monitoring may be necessary at closer intervals of  \n time depending on the clinical condition of the patient e.g. 1-monthly interval. \n Withholding cardiotoxic therapy only as a last resort. (for anthracycline  \n LVEF < 45%, for anti-HER2 therapy LVEF < 40%).\n Monitoring even after completion of therapy:\n  Obtain post therapy LVEF.\n  Repeat echocardiography in 6 months or 1 year. Most cases of  \n  treatment-associated cardiac dysfunction develop within the first year  \n  after completion of therapy.475,476 \n  If EF remains abnormal, follow guidelines for management of HF.465 \n \n8.5.6 HEART FAILURE AND KIDNEY DYSFUNCTION\n8.5.6.1 Epidemiology, definitions and classifications Cardiac and pre-existing kidney disease at admission frequently co-exist, \nvarying from 45.4% in patients with chronic HF to > 60% in those with AHF.\n477,478 \nIn addition, during treatment of AHF, a significant proportion of patients will develop varying degrees of worsening renal function (WRF).\nThe definition of WRF is:\n479\n An increase in serum creatinine by ≥ 26.5μmol/ L (0.3mg/dl) and/or\n A ≥ 25% increase in serum creatinine or a ≥ 20% drop in eGFR.\nThe rise in serum creatinine usually occurs in the first three to five days of \nhospitalisation. The incidence of WRF is estimated to be between 19 and 45%.165 This large \nobserved range is due to variations in the definitions of WRF, the observed time-at-risk and the study population.\n165 \nRisk factors for WRF during admission for HF include:480\n A prior history of HF or diabetes, \n An admission serum creatinine of > 133μmol/L,  or \n Systolic blood pressure > 160mmHg. \nWRF may fulfill criteria for type 1 or type 2 cardiorenal syndrome (CRS). The term “cardiorenal syndrome” refers to disorders of the heart and kidneys whereby acute or chronic dysfunction in one organ may induce acute or chronic dysfunction of the other.\n165 \nThis syndrome has been classified by the Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative working group into 5 subtypes as shown in Table 17, Page 105.\n165 Many \npatients however, may belong to more than one subtype and may move between subtypes during the course of their disease.\n165\n8.5.6.2. Pathogenesis of CRS \nMultiple mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of CRS. These include:\n Increased renal venous pressure  - venous congestion is probably the  \n most important factor.481 \n RV dysfunction.\n Reduced renal perfusion with reduced cardiac output. \n Neurohumoral adaptations (e.g. activation of the sympathetic nervous  \n system and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, increases in  \n vasopressin and endothelin-1).8.5.6.3  Clinical significance /Impact of kidney dysfunction in HF  The combination of cardiac and kidney disease increases the complexity and \ncosts of care, and may interact to worsen prognosis. \nA. Pharmacologic considerations \n Safety:\n  Dosing of renally-excreted cardiac drugs need adjustment in the  \n  presence of renal impairment (e.g. digoxin, insulin, low molecular  \n  weight heparin).\n  Patients with HF are at increased risk of contrast-induced acute kidney \n  injury. I,C\nI,C\nIIa,BI,CI,C\nI,C\n Efficacy:\n  Impaired renal function will affect drug choices and dosing. If eGFR <  \n  30mls/min/1.73m2, most thiazide diuretics are no longer effective and  \n  loop diuretics are preferred. Higher doses of loop diuretics may be   \n  required with increasing renal impairment.    \n         B. Prognostic implications\n Preexisting CKD is a bad prognostic indicator in patients with HF - the  \n more severe the CKD, the worse the mortality.482,483\n In patients with HF, WRF may not always indicate a poor outcome.484 The  \n prognostic value of WRF is mainly determined by:   The presence of persistent congestion  \n  Baseline renal function and magnitude of renal changes \n  Duration - persistent WRF is usually associated with hemodynamic  \n  derangements and poor prognosis as compared with transient WRF  \n  as a result of agressive decongestive therapy.\n485-487\nTable 17: Classification of Cardiorenal Syndrome (CRS)8.5.6.4. Management \n A multi-disciplinary approach is recommended. Early referral to a  \n nephrologist is advisable.   \n Exclude potentially reversible causes for increasing renal dysfunction  \n such as hyper - or hypovolaemia, concomitant medications such as  \n aminoglycosides and NSAIDs, ACE-I or ARB and renal artery stenosis. \n Closely monitor electrolytes and kidney function, especially during acute  \n illnesses, dehydration and when increasing doses of cardiac drugs  \n including diuretics. The baseline renal function will determine how frequently \n this should be done. \n The recommended range for serum potassium is 4-5.5mmol/L.488 \n Wherever possible, avoid nephrotoxins, e.g. contrast media for angiography\n Intravenous diuretics \n  Loop diuretics are the first choice.\n  Continuous infusion may not have greater benefits compared with  \n  bolus dosing.115-118,489\n  Start initially with 2-2.5 times the usual oral dose. \n  Combination therapy (loop diuretic and thiazide/thiazide-like diuretic/\n  mineralocorticoid) may be required to enhance diuresis.205-207 However,  \n  care is required to avoid electrolyte disturbances, hypovolaemia and  \n  worsening renal dysfunction. \n Careful use of Renin Angiotensin System (RAS) blockers  \n  HF patients with stable, chronic mild-moderate renal insufficiency  \n  (eGFR > 30mls/min/1.73m2) should receive standard therapy with an  \n  ACE-I/ ARB and an MRA.490\n  A serum creatinine rise or GFR decrease by up to 30% from baseline  \n  may be acceptable before it becomes necessary to consider stopping  \n  or decreasing doses.221 \n  In patients with advanced renal failure, the decision to start or stop  \n  RAS blockers should be individualised.490\n  Consider withholding RAS blockers during aggressive diuresis in  \n  patients at high risk for WRF.  RAS blockers (and β-blockers) can be used in patients with HF who  \n  are on chronic dialysis therapy.\n Ultrafiltration \n  This involves the removal of plasma water across a semi-permeable  \n  membrane in response to a transmembrane pressure gradient.   It may be considered for congestive symptoms refractory to diuresis,  \n  but should be used in consultation with a nephrologist.\n491\n  Evidence for its efficacy in fluid removal is mixed at present.491  Haemodialysis \n  Criteria for possible need to initiate renal replacement therapy include:\n   Oliguria unresponsive to fluid resuscitation.\n   Severe hyperkalaemia (serum potassium > 6.5mmol/L).\n   Severe acidaemia (pH < 7.2). \n   Serum urea > 25mmol/L. \n    Serum creatinine > 300μmol/L. \n8.6  ADVANCED HEART FAILURE/REFRACTORY HEART FAILURE\nThese are patients with severe symptoms of HF despite maximal medical \ntherapy. Hospital admission is necessary for stabilisation. Meticulous control of fluid balance is important. Aggravating causes of HF as listed in Table 5, Page 39 should be identified and treated.\nThese patients may need specialised treatment in CCU or ICU. The following \nmay be required:\n Intravenous infusion of frusemide. These patients may require combination  \n loop diuretics and thiazides.\n Intravenous infusion of inotropes - low dose dobutamine (5mcg/kg/min) or  \n milrinone. These improve symptoms but no survival benefit has been  \n demonstrated.126,492\n Ultrafiltration in patients who are fluid overloaded.493 In most patients,  \n however, the relief is temporary.\nThe prognosis of these patients is poor. They should be referred to assess \nwhether they may be potential candidates for mechanical circulatory support (e.g. LVAD) and consideration for heart transplant.\n8.6.1 HEART TRANSPLANTHeart transplantation is a well-established treatment of refractory end stage \nHF. This definitive therapy for HF however is limited by the lack of donor organs.\n494,495All patients with severe symptomatic HF despite optimal medical therapy and no other alternative therapy option should be considered for heart transplant. They need to be referred to a HF specialist cardiac hospital for further evaluation.\nAssessment for heart transplant is done by a multispeciality, multidisciplinary \nteam and appropriate work up will be performed for eligibility.\nEligibility criteria to be considered for heart transplant include:\n Poor LVEF (< 25%).\n Recurrent HF hospitalisations.\n Major limitation of the patient’s daily activities.\n Poor effort tolerance i.e. peak VO2 (maximal oxygen consumption or  \n peak oxygen uptake) less than 10ml/kg/min (or < 50% predicted). VO2  \n max is the maximum rate of oxygen consumption measured during  \n incremental exercise ie exercise of increasing intensity and is widely  \n used as an indicator of cardiorespiratory fitness.\n Intravenous inotropic dependence for symptomatic relief or to maintain  \n end organ function.\n Motivated, psychologically stable and compliant to therapy.\nContraindications to heart transplant\n Active infection.\n Severe peripheral arterial or cerebrovascular disease.\n Malignancy within 5 years.\n Diabetes mellitus with widespread microvascular complications.\n Systemic disease with multi-organ dysfunction.\n Irreversible chronic kidney, liver or lung disease.\n Pharmacologically irreversible pulmonary hypertension.\n Other medical or psychosocial issues that would impact survival.\n8.6.2 MECHANICAL CIRCULATORY SUPPORT The use of mechanical circulatory support (e.g. LVAD), should be considered \nfor patients with potentially reversible or treatable conditions or as a bridge to heart transplant in suitable candidates.\nLVAD may also be used as destination therapy in candidates who are not \nsuitable for transplant. Patients have improvement in their symptoms when compared to optimal medical therapy.\n496,497 However, the rate of rehospitalisations \ndue to complications of bleeding, thrombosis and infections are high.496-498 \nMany patients also go into major depression. Thus, extensive discussion with the patient and family is necessary prior to LVAD implantation.8.7 PALLIATIVE AND END OF LIFE CARE\nDespite recent advances in therapy, for some patients, HF remains a \nprogressive disease and carries a poor prognosis. Patients with refractory symptoms despite guideline-directed medical therapy, should be considered for palliative and end of life care if they have the following characteristics:\n499\n Progressive functional decline (mental and physical) and dependence in  \n most activities of daily living.\n Severe HF symptoms with poor quality of life despite optimal pharmacological \n and non-pharmacological therapies.\n Frequent hospital admissions or serious episodes of decompensation  \n despite optimal therapies.\n Heart transplantation and mechanical circulatory support ruled out.\n Cardiac cachexia.\n Clinically judged to be near end of life.\nThe aim of palliative care in HF is to prevent and relieve suffering and to promote the best quality of life for patients and their families.\n500\nDespite the complexities of end-of-life issues in HF patients, there is minimal evidence-based guidance on the care of this population.\n501 The key components \nof end-of-life care are:\n 1. Advanced care plan with directives and informed decisions on:\n   Use or withdrawal of treatment including advanced therapies such  \n   as V inotropes, ICD and mechanical circulatory support. \n   When it would be appropriate to switch off devices such as ICD or  \n   CRT. \n   Resuscitation status.\n   Preferred location of death (i.e. at home or hospital).\n 2. Symptom management \n  Goals of care at this stage should shift from extending life to controlling \n  symptoms and maximising quality of life. Common symptoms include:\n   Dyspnoea\n   Fatigue\n   Pain\n   Urinary retention \n  Constipation\n  Cachexia\n  Depression\n Medications that may be useful include analgesics, antiemetics, anxiolytics,  \n opioids, laxatives, and diuretics, etc. \n3. Psychosocial support\n The impact of HF on quality of life for the patient and family is complex and  \n extends beyond physical symptoms.502\n Emotional, spiritual and social support should be provided to alleviate patient  \n anxiety about dying, and to guide patient towards a peaceful journey at the end  \n of life.\n9.1 LEVEL OF CARE AND SHARED MANAGEMENT \nThe care of patients with HF should ideally take place in a multidisciplinary system, \nallowing for shared care between the hospital (secondary or tertiary settings) and \ncommunity (primary setting). A multidisciplinary approach encompasses patient \neducation, cardiac rehabilitation, psychosocial support and palliative care, and has been proven to reduce HF hospitalisations and mortality in discharged patients.\n503-505\nThe multidisciplinary team usually consists of cardiologists and or general physicians, HF nurses, pharmacists, dieticians, physiotherapists, primary care \nproviders, social workers as well as geriatricians, psychologists, occupational \ntherapists and when necessary, palliative care specialists. Care can be done in two different settings: \n In the patient’s own home - home-based interventions are associated with  \n significantly lower healthcare costs, reduced hospital readmissions and an  \n improvement in the patient’s quality of life.506 This may however, not be feasible  \n in our local setting.\n Specialist outpatient clinic - the Heart Failure Clinic (HFC). \nHFCs can either be:\n Nurse-directed - these are run by nurses with special training in HF.\n Physician-directed - run by general physicians and/or cardiologists. \nHFCs can be established in the tertiary hospitals or in the primary care setting. The minimum human resource requirements are a:\n Cardiologist or general physician with an interest in cardiology and HF, \n Dedicated nurse and \n Medical technologist for blood taking, doing echocardiography and 6 minutes \n walk tests.In bigger clinic settings, the involvement of physiotherapists to encourage physical \nactivity, pharmacists and counsellors for end of life care would be advisable.\nThese clinics will be the intermediary between in-patient hospital care and community \nprimary care. Patients who can be seen in these clinics include those:507\n Recently discharged after an admission for decompensated HF (a waiting \n time of 7-12 days post discharge has to be the maximum wait-time).\n Who are in the early decompensation phase and need treatment modification.\n Who are stable but need uptitration of HF medications.\n With ICD or CRTs. \n With comorbidities, such as renal dysfunction, diabetes and COPD.\n With advanced HF who may benefit from:\n  Heart transplant\n  Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD)\n  Palliative care.\nThe objectives of these HF clinics may vary based on local settings. These include:\n507,508\n Optimisation of medical therapy particularly the uptitration of β-blockers, ACE-I  \n and MRA. \n Education of the patient and caregiver on the nature of the disease and its  \n progression. \n Promotion of self-care such as :\n  Compliance to medical therapy and fluid restriction.\n  Regular weighing and adjusting diuretic doses according to symptoms and  \n  body weight.\nPatient with optimised HF medications/treatment plans can be discharged to the \ncommunity with appropriate care plans to primary care. Close partnership between these HF clinics and primary care helps to reduce unnecessary admissions to hospital. \nIn 2018, the Heart Failure Medication Therapy Adherence Clinic (MTAC) was \nintroduced. These clinics are conducted by pharmacists in collaboration with doctors and other healthcare providers to improve HF management. The objectives of the Heart Failure MTAC are:\n509\n Enhance patient’s adherence to HF pharmacotherapy and non-pharmacological  \n interventions.\n To reduce unscheduled emergency department visits or hospitalisations of HF  \n patient due to acute decompensation.\n To provide consultative service to doctors on evidence-based HF pharmacotherapy  \n and related issues.\n To collaborate with doctors and other health care professionals in HF management  \n program.9.2 MONITORING AND FOLLOW-UP \nPatients with HF require regular follow-up and monitoring. Serial evaluations serve \nto assess a patient’s status, response to therapy, development of complications and disease progression. Key components of assessment include:\n Functional capacity - NYHA functional class or 6-minute walk test \n Fluid status and body weight \n Blood pressure, heart rate and rhythm \n Examination of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems\n Cognitive status and nutritional status \n Review of pharmacotherapy - uptitration, compliance and side effects\n Serum urea, electrolytes, creatinine and eGFR as necessary\n Diet and sodium intake\n Consumption of alcohol or illicit drugs\n Smoking history.\nThe frequency of follow-up will depend on the patient’s clinical stability and need for pharmacotherapy optimisation. A patient with a recent episode of decompensation or clinical instability, for instance, should ideally be seen again soon, usually within 2 weeks. Ultimately, the intensity and type of follow-up would be determined by the local organisation of care and resources.\nRoutine serial echocardiogram is not recommended. However, if there has been a \nrecent change in clinical status or if the patient has received treatment that might significantly change certain echocardiographic parameters, a follow-up echocardiogram is reasonable to assess the LVEF and structural remodeling.\nSerial brain natriuretic peptide measurements to guide and tailor HF therapy cannot \nbe broadly recommended at the present time due to a lack of consistent evidence.\n29-32 \n9.3 CARDIOLOGY REFERRAL \nHF patients with stable symptoms may be managed at the primary care level. \nReferral to the cardiologist should be considered in the following situations: \n De novo HF for a comprehensive workup to confirm the diagnosis and determine  \n the aetiology, and to devise a management plan.\n Episodes of acute decompensation.\n Worsening HF symptoms despite appropriate therapy. \n HF complicated with symptomatic hypotension or excessive bradycardia, limiting \n uptitration of pharmacotherapy. Symptomatic stable CAD and/or acute coronary syndrome for consideration of  \n revascularisation (PCI or CABG). \n Resuscitated cardiac arrest.\n Documented or suspected significant arrhythmias e.g. AF, VT.\n Significant valvular disease not previously assessed or worsening valvular  \n dysfunction.\n Pre-conception assessment and counselling of women with significant structural  \n heart disease and a past history of HF or LV dysfunction. \n Complex congenital cardiac lesions and/or Eisenmenger’s syndrome.\nDespite taking conventional HF therapy, patients may seek alternative therapy and healing approaches that are not considered as allopathic medicine. The National Centre for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) defines complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) as a group of diverse medical and healthcare interventions, practices, products or disciplines that are not generally considered part of conventional medicine.\n10.1 Enhanced External Counter Pulsation (EECP)\nThere is inadequate evidence of clinical effectiveness of EECP in HF.\n510-513 There is \nconcern that it could precipitate or exacerbate HF. \n10.2 Stem cell therapy\nA global position paper on cardiovascular regenerative medicine stated that \ncell-based therapy in HF patients is neither positive nor consistent.514 \n10.3 Omega 3 fatty acids\nIn patients with HFrEF, it may be considered as an adjunctive therapy based on a \nsingle randomised controlled trial (RCT) which showed a small benefit in CV death and/or hospitalisations.\n515,516 10.4 Coenzyme Q10\nThere is no convincing evidence to support or refute the use of coenzyme Q10 for \npatients with HF.517\n10.5 Tai Chi\nTai Chi may improve 6 min walk test distance, quality of life and LVEF in patients with \nHF.518,519 Its effect on hard CV outcomes such as rehospitalisation, MI and mortality \nis not known. \n10.6 YogaA meta-analysis in 2014 that includes two RCTs concluded that yoga improved peak \nVO2 (exercise capacity) and quality of life in chronic HF patients.\n520 There is an \nongoing RCT to look at the effect of yoga in HFpEF patients.521\nThe focus of future development for HF in Malaysia should be towards service \nenhancement working to meet the World Heart Federation mandate of a 25% reduction in premature non-communicable disease mortality by 2025. \nFinding the balance between costs and quality remains a global challenge, and the \nunderstanding of the disease in our healthcare context is imperative to making sure we move forward regarding service delivery, human resource allocation, medical expense costs and patient outcomes. To achieve this, the following need to be undertaken: \n Epidemiological studies to understand the disease profile in the country.\n Establishment and expansion of HFCs leading to more patient-centred HF care.\n Expanding service delivery, human resource allocation, medical expense cost  \n and patient outcomes.\n Education of healthcare personnel.\nEfforts should be directed to the knowledge and understanding of the epidemiology of HF in our country, its phenotype, presentation, current adherence to guideline-directed therapy and outcomes. Regular cluster sampling cohorts or a nationwide registry should be considered. Understanding the limitations of service delivery albeit geography or human resources and making plans for better service delivery systems \nare important.\nDevelopment of HFCs, can lead to a more patient-centric HF care. (See Section 9, Pages 110-113)\nModules for HF care need to be initiated in order to train and educate general \ninternal medicine physicians. A core-curriculum for education needs to be formed to ensure adequate training has been disseminated to HFC personnel.   \nIncentives regarding HF guidelines compliance should be implemented and HF \ninnovative practice should be encouraged with awards for best clinical practice and innovation be made available. \nThis streamline approach to HF care with engagement of connected groups hopefully \nwill help in better overall patient care and experience.\nPerformance measures should be used with the goal of improving quality of care for HF.\n518,519\nProcess performance measures focus on the aspects of care that are delivered to a patient, \nwhile outcome measures focus on the end-points such as mortality or hospitalisation.\nProcess performance indicators for in-patients with HF includes:522-524\n % of patients who had documentation of NYHA Functional Class.\n % of patients who had LVEF measurement.\n % of patients with current or prior LVEF < 40% and without contraindications  \n discharged with ACE-I/ARB. \n % of patients with current or prior LVEF < 40% and without contraindications  \n discharged on β-blockers.\n % of patients with current or prior LVEF < 40% and without contraindications  \n discharged on MRA.\n % of patients with chronic or paroxysmal AF/atrial flutter without contraindications  \n on anticoagulant therapy at discharge.\n % of patients given a post discharge appointment.\nThe accepted performance measure should be more than 60%.Outcome measures indicators include:\n In-hospital mortality\n 30-day readmission for HF\nRefer to Appendix VI, Page 121 for calculation of these measures."

Cardiomyopathy characterised by a decrease in Ejection Fraction (EF)  \n globally or due to regional changes in interventricular septum contraction. \n2. Symptoms of HF.3. Signs associated with HF including but not limited to S3 gallop, tachycardia,  \n or both.4. Decline in initial EF of at least 5% to < 55% with signs and symptoms of  \n HF or asymptomatic decrease in EF of at least 10% to < 55%.Chemotherapy drugs that have been associated with HF include (Appendix V, Page120):\n Doxorubicin \n  5% at a cumulative dose of 400mg/m2 (the higher the cumulative dose, \n  the greater the risk of HF.445  \n  Even at lower doses of 180 to 240mg/m2, subclinical events can  \n  occur in up to 30% of patients about 13 years post treatment.448\n  These suggest that there is no ‘safe’ dose for doxorubicin. \n Cyclophosphamide especially in high doses and ifosfomide.449,450  \n Newer agents such as monoclonal antibodies (trastuzumab and pertuzumab), \n small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (imatinib, sunitinib, sorafenib)  \n and the proteasome inhibitor (bortezomib).  Trastuzumab especially when administered together with anthracyclines \n  and cyclophosphamide, has been associated with an increased incidence \n  of HF of 27% compared to 1.7% to 4.1% when anthracycline was not part  \n  of the therapeutic regimen.\n451-453 Symptoms are usually mild to moderate \n  and improve following medical management and termination of drug  \n  administration. Improvement is usually seen in about 4-6 weeks after    withdrawal of the agent.\n454-456 After symptomatic improvement, \n  reinstitution  of treatment is usually possible.454-456\n  Vascular endothelial growth factor signaling pathway (VSP) inhibitors  \n  (bevacizumab) can cause hypertension. Bevacizumab also blocks  \n  receptors that are involved in the compensatory response to stress in  \n  the cardiomyocytes and when the heart is unable to compensate for  \n  the hypertension, it could lead to HF.457,458 Maintaining good blood pressure \n  control can prevent HF associated with this agent. Heart failure due to  \n  VSP inhibitors is usually reversible with cessation of the agent.459\nOne must consider both the efficacy and the toxicity in choosing chemotherapeutic agents. Many of the newer targeted agents cause a reversible form of HF and symptoms usually resolve after the initiation of anti-failure medications.\n454-456,459,460 \nRisk factors for anthracycline toxicity include: 461-465\n The total cumulative dose\n Intravenous bolus administration versus infusion\n Higher single doses\n History of prior irradiation\n Use of concomitant agents known to have cardiotoxicity\n Female gender\n Underlying CV disease\n Age (young and elderly)\n An increase in cardiac biomarkers such as troponins during and   after administration is an indication of toxicity.8.5.5.1 Management\n Patients undergoing chemotherapy should have a careful clinical evaluation \n and assessment and treatment of CV risk factors.464,465\n Blood pressure control is important in all patients especially in those  \n being considered for VSP inhibitors.\n All patients with potential cardiotoxic chemotherapy should have an  \n echocardiogram prior to treatment. An important parameter is the LVEF  \n determined using the biplane method of discs (Simpson’s method) or  \n three-dimensional echocardiography where available. Newer techniques   to detect and quantitate regional and global myocardial dysfunction  \n (strain assessment with global longitudinal strain) can be used to detect  \n pre-clinical and subtle changes in function.\n466-469 \n Biomarkers such as troponin and natriuretic peptides can help identify  \n patients at higher risk.462,463,470,471 \nClose collaboration between the oncologist and the cardiologist is important. \nFor the oncologists, the strategy (prior to commencement) includes:465\n Identifying high risk patients (pre-existing heart disease, presence of  \n CV risk factors, age - young and old, female gender, use of high dose  \n anthracycline regimens).\n High risk patients should:\n  Have a pre-treatment cardiac function evaluation. If the LVEF is < 50%,  \n  refer to the cardiologist.  Be considered for non-cardiotoxic alternatives. \n  Have their therapy protocols adjusted where necessary (e.g. reduction \n  in doses, continuous infusions rather than bolus injections, liposomal    doxorubicin, dexrazoxane etc). \nFor the cardiologists/general physicians, the strategy includes:\n Treating CV risk factors. \n Assessing, repeating (if necessary) imaging studies. (e.g. using high  \n quality LVEF measurement, strain evaluation etc).\n Assessing cardiac biomarkers (troponin and/or NP).\n Considering cardio-protection prior to/or during treatment using β-blockers,  \n MRA and/or ACE-I/ARB if:69,465,472-474\n  EF < 50%, \n  EF drops by > 10%\n  Abnormal global longitudinal strain (GLS) (> 15% drop). \nKey message 9:\n Chemotherapy-induced cardiomyopathy is not common; clinical  \n HF occurs in 1-5%.\n Close collaboration between the oncologist and the cardiologist is  \n important. \n Patients undergoing chemotherapy should have a careful clinical  \n evaluation, assessment and treatment of CV risk factors. Monitoring LVEF during therapy is important with repeat echocardiography  \n at 3-monthly intervals and/or according to symptoms. If cardioprotective  \n medications are given, monitoring may be necessary at closer intervals of  \n time depending on the clinical condition of the patient e.g. 1-monthly interval. \n Withholding cardiotoxic therapy only as a last resort. (for anthracycline  \n LVEF < 45%, for anti-HER2 therapy LVEF < 40%).\n Monitoring even after completion of therapy:\n  Obtain post therapy LVEF.\n  Repeat echocardiography in 6 months or 1 year. Most cases of  \n  treatment-associated cardiac dysfunction develop within the first year  \n  after completion of therapy.475,476 \n  If EF remains abnormal, follow guidelines for management of HF.465 \n \n8.5.6 HEART FAILURE AND KIDNEY DYSFUNCTION\n8.5.6.1 Epidemiology, definitions and classifications Cardiac and pre-existing kidney disease at admission frequently co-exist, \nvarying from 45.4% in patients with chronic HF to > 60% in those with AHF.\n477,478 \nIn addition, during treatment of AHF, a significant proportion of patients will develop varying degrees of worsening renal function (WRF).\nThe definition of WRF is:\n479\n An increase in serum creatinine by ≥ 26.5μmol/ L (0.3mg/dl) and/or\n A ≥ 25% increase in serum creatinine or a ≥ 20% drop in eGFR.\nThe rise in serum creatinine usually occurs in the first three to five days of \nhospitalisation. The incidence of WRF is estimated to be between 19 and 45%.165 This large \nobserved range is due to variations in the definitions of WRF, the observed time-at-risk and the study population.\n165 \nRisk factors for WRF during admission for HF include:480\n A prior history of HF or diabetes, \n An admission serum creatinine of > 133μmol/L,  or \n Systolic blood pressure > 160mmHg. \nWRF may fulfill criteria for type 1 or type 2 cardiorenal syndrome (CRS). The term “cardiorenal syndrome” refers to disorders of the heart and kidneys whereby acute or chronic dysfunction in one organ may induce acute or chronic dysfunction of the other.\n165 \nThis syndrome has been classified by the Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative working group into 5 subtypes as shown in Table 17, Page 105.\n165 Many \npatients however, may belong to more than one subtype and may move between subtypes during the course of their disease.\n165\n8.5.6.2. Pathogenesis of CRS \nMultiple mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of CRS. These include:\n Increased renal venous pressure  - venous congestion is probably the  \n most important factor.481 \n RV dysfunction.\n Reduced renal perfusion with reduced cardiac output. \n Neurohumoral adaptations (e.g. activation of the sympathetic nervous  \n system and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, increases in  \n vasopressin and endothelin-1).8.5.6.3  Clinical significance /Impact of kidney dysfunction in HF  The combination of cardiac and kidney disease increases the complexity and \ncosts of care, and may interact to worsen prognosis. \nA. Pharmacologic considerations \n Safety:\n  Dosing of renally-excreted cardiac drugs need adjustment in the  \n  presence of renal impairment (e.g. digoxin, insulin, low molecular  \n  weight heparin).\n  Patients with HF are at increased risk of contrast-induced acute kidney \n  injury. \n Efficacy:\n  Impaired renal function will affect drug choices and dosing. If eGFR <  \n  30mls/min/1.73m2, most thiazide diuretics are no longer effective and  \n  loop diuretics are preferred. Higher doses of loop diuretics may be   \n  required with increasing renal impairment.             B. Prognostic implications\n Preexisting CKD is a bad prognostic indicator in patients with HF - the  \n more severe the CKD, the worse the mortality.482,483\n In patients with HF, WRF may not always indicate a poor outcome.484 The  \n prognostic value of WRF is mainly determined by:   The presence of persistent congestion  \n  Baseline renal function and magnitude of renal changes \n  Duration - persistent WRF is usually associated with hemodynamic  \n  derangements and poor prognosis as compared with transient WRF  \n  as a result of agressive decongestive therapy.\n485-487\nTable 17: Classification of Cardiorenal Syndrome (CRS)8.5.6.4. Management \n A multi-disciplinary approach is recommended. Early referral to a  \n nephrologist is advisable.   \n Exclude potentially reversible causes for increasing renal dysfunction  \n such as hyper - or hypovolaemia, concomitant medications such as  \n aminoglycosides and NSAIDs, ACE-I or ARB and renal artery stenosis. \n Closely monitor electrolytes and kidney function, especially during acute  \n illnesses, dehydration and when increasing doses of cardiac drugs  \n including diuretics. The baseline renal function will determine how frequently \n this should be done. \n The recommended range for serum potassium is 4-5.5mmol/L.488 \n Wherever possible, avoid nephrotoxins, e.g. contrast media for angiography\n Intravenous diuretics \n  Loop diuretics are the first choice.\n  Continuous infusion may not have greater benefits compared with  \n  bolus dosing.115-118,489\n  Start initially with 2-2.5 times the usual oral dose. \n  Combination therapy (loop diuretic and thiazide/thiazide-like diuretic/\n  mineralocorticoid) may be required to enhance diuresis.205-207 However,  \n  care is required to avoid electrolyte disturbances, hypovolaemia and  \n  worsening renal dysfunction. \n Careful use of Renin Angiotensin System (RAS) blockers  \n  HF patients with stable, chronic mild-moderate renal insufficiency  \n  (eGFR > 30mls/min/1.73m2) should receive standard therapy with an  \n  ACE-I/ ARB and an MRA.490\n  A serum creatinine rise or GFR decrease by up to 30% from baseline  \n  may be acceptable before it becomes necessary to consider stopping  \n  or decreasing doses.221 \n  In patients with advanced renal failure, the decision to start or stop  \n  RAS blockers should be individualised.490\n  Consider withholding RAS blockers during aggressive diuresis in  \n  patients at high risk for WRF.  RAS blockers (and β-blockers) can be used in patients with HF who  \n  are on chronic dialysis therapy.\n Ultrafiltration \n  This involves the removal of plasma water across a semi-permeable  \n  membrane in response to a transmembrane pressure gradient.   It may be considered for congestive symptoms refractory to diuresis,  \n  but should be used in consultation with a nephrologist.\n491\n  Evidence for its efficacy in fluid removal is mixed at present.491  Haemodialysis \n  Criteria for possible need to initiate renal replacement therapy include:\n   Oliguria unresponsive to fluid resuscitation.\n   Severe hyperkalaemia (serum potassium > 6.5mmol/L).\n   Severe acidaemia (pH < 7.2). \n   Serum urea > 25mmol/L. \n    Serum creatinine > 300μmol/L. \n8.6  ADVANCED HEART FAILURE/REFRACTORY HEART FAILURE\nThese are patients with severe symptoms of HF despite maximal medical \ntherapy. Hospital admission is necessary for stabilisation. Meticulous control of fluid balance is important. Aggravating causes of HF as listed in Table 5, Page 39 should be identified and treated.\nThese patients may need specialised treatment in CCU or ICU. The following \nmay be required:\n Intravenous infusion of frusemide. These patients may require combination  \n loop diuretics and thiazides.\n Intravenous infusion of inotropes - low dose dobutamine (5mcg/kg/min) or  \n milrinone. These improve symptoms but no survival benefit has been  \n demonstrated.126,492\n Ultrafiltration in patients who are fluid overloaded.493 In most patients,  \n however, the relief is temporary.\nThe prognosis of these patients is poor. They should be referred to assess \nwhether they may be potential candidates for mechanical circulatory support (e.g. LVAD) and consideration for heart transplant.\n8.6.1 HEART TRANSPLANTHeart transplantation is a well-established treatment of refractory end stage \nHF. This definitive therapy for HF however is limited by the lack of donor organs.\n494,495All patients with severe symptomatic HF despite optimal medical therapy and no other alternative therapy option should be considered for heart transplant. They need to be referred to a HF specialist cardiac hospital for further evaluation.\nAssessment for heart transplant is done by a multispeciality, multidisciplinary \nteam and appropriate work up will be performed for eligibility.\nEligibility criteria to be considered for heart transplant include:\n Poor LVEF (< 25%).\n Recurrent HF hospitalisations.\n Major limitation of the patient’s daily activities.\n Poor effort tolerance i.e. peak VO2 (maximal oxygen consumption or  \n peak oxygen uptake) less than 10ml/kg/min (or < 50% predicted). VO2  \n max is the maximum rate of oxygen consumption measured during  \n incremental exercise ie exercise of increasing intensity and is widely  \n used as an indicator of cardiorespiratory fitness.\n Intravenous inotropic dependence for symptomatic relief or to maintain  \n end organ function.\n Motivated, psychologically stable and compliant to therapy.\nContraindications to heart transplant\n Active infection.\n Severe peripheral arterial or cerebrovascular disease.\n Malignancy within 5 years.\n Diabetes mellitus with widespread microvascular complications.\n Systemic disease with multi-organ dysfunction.\n Irreversible chronic kidney, liver or lung disease.\n Pharmacologically irreversible pulmonary hypertension.\n Other medical or psychosocial issues that would impact survival.\n8.6.2 MECHANICAL CIRCULATORY SUPPORT The use of mechanical circulatory support (e.g. LVAD), should be considered \nfor patients with potentially reversible or treatable conditions or as a bridge to heart transplant in suitable candidates.\nLVAD may also be used as destination therapy in candidates who are not \nsuitable for transplant. Patients have improvement in their symptoms when compared to optimal medical therapy.\n496,497 However, the rate of rehospitalisations \ndue to complications of bleeding, thrombosis and infections are high.496-498 \nMany patients also go into major depression. Thus, extensive discussion with the patient and family is necessary prior to LVAD implantation.8.7 PALLIATIVE AND END OF LIFE CARE\nDespite recent advances in therapy, for some patients, HF remains a \nprogressive disease and carries a poor prognosis. Patients with refractory symptoms despite guideline-directed medical therapy, should be considered for palliative and end of life care if they have the following characteristics:\n499\n Progressive functional decline (mental and physical) and dependence in  \n most activities of daily living.\n Severe HF symptoms with poor quality of life despite optimal pharmacological \n and non-pharmacological therapies.\n Frequent hospital admissions or serious episodes of decompensation  \n despite optimal therapies.\n Heart transplantation and mechanical circulatory support ruled out.\n Cardiac cachexia.\n Clinically judged to be near end of life.\nThe aim of palliative care in HF is to prevent and relieve suffering and to promote the best quality of life for patients and their families.\n500\nDespite the complexities of end-of-life issues in HF patients, there is minimal evidence-based guidance on the care of this population.\n501 The key components \nof end-of-life care are:\n 1. Advanced care plan with directives and informed decisions on:\n   Use or withdrawal of treatment including advanced therapies such  \n   as V inotropes, ICD and mechanical circulatory support. \n   When it would be appropriate to switch off devices such as ICD or  \n   CRT. \n   Resuscitation status.\n   Preferred location of death (i.e. at home or hospital).\n 2. Symptom management \n  Goals of care at this stage should shift from extending life to controlling \n  symptoms and maximising quality of life. Common symptoms include:\n   Dyspnoea\n   Fatigue\n   Pain\n   Urinary retention \n  Constipation\n  Cachexia\n  Depression\n Medications that may be useful include analgesics, antiemetics, anxiolytics,  \n opioids, laxatives, and diuretics, etc. \n3. Psychosocial support\n The impact of HF on quality of life for the patient and family is complex and  \n extends beyond physical symptoms.502\n Emotional, spiritual and social support should be provided to alleviate patient  \n anxiety about dying, and to guide patient towards a peaceful journey at the end  \n of life.\n9.1 LEVEL OF CARE AND SHARED MANAGEMENT \nThe care of patients with HF should ideally take place in a multidisciplinary system, \nallowing for shared care between the hospital (secondary or tertiary settings) and \ncommunity (primary setting). A multidisciplinary approach encompasses patient \neducation, cardiac rehabilitation, psychosocial support and palliative care, and has been proven to reduce HF hospitalisations and mortality in discharged patients.\n503-505\nThe multidisciplinary team usually consists of cardiologists and or general physicians, HF nurses, pharmacists, dieticians, physiotherapists, primary care \nproviders, social workers as well as geriatricians, psychologists, occupational \ntherapists and when necessary, palliative care specialists. Care can be done in two different settings: \n In the patient’s own home - home-based interventions are associated with  \n significantly lower healthcare costs, reduced hospital readmissions and an  \n improvement in the patient’s quality of life.506 This may however, not be feasible  \n in our local setting.\n Specialist outpatient clinic - the Heart Failure Clinic (HFC). \nHFCs can either be:\n Nurse-directed - these are run by nurses with special training in HF.\n Physician-directed - run by general physicians and/or cardiologists. \nHFCs can be established in the tertiary hospitals or in the primary care setting. The minimum human resource requirements are a:\n Cardiologist or general physician with an interest in cardiology and HF, \n Dedicated nurse and \n Medical technologist for blood taking, doing echocardiography and 6 minutes \n walk tests.In bigger clinic settings, the involvement of physiotherapists to encourage physical \nactivity, pharmacists and counsellors for end of life care would be advisable.\nThese clinics will be the intermediary between in-patient hospital care and community \nprimary care. Patients who can be seen in these clinics include those:507\n Recently discharged after an admission for decompensated HF (a waiting \n time of 7-12 days post discharge has to be the maximum wait-time).\n Who are in the early decompensation phase and need treatment modification.\n Who are stable but need uptitration of HF medications.\n With ICD or CRTs. \n With comorbidities, such as renal dysfunction, diabetes and COPD.\n With advanced HF who may benefit from:\n  Heart transplant\n  Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD)\n  Palliative care.\nThe objectives of these HF clinics may vary based on local settings. These include:\n507,508\n Optimisation of medical therapy particularly the uptitration of β-blockers, ACE-I  \n and MRA. \n Education of the patient and caregiver on the nature of the disease and its  \n progression. \n Promotion of self-care such as :\n  Compliance to medical therapy and fluid restriction.\n  Regular weighing and adjusting diuretic doses according to symptoms and  \n  body weight.\nPatient with optimised HF medications/treatment plans can be discharged to the \ncommunity with appropriate care plans to primary care. Close partnership between these HF clinics and primary care helps to reduce unnecessary admissions to hospital. \nIn 2018, the Heart Failure Medication Therapy Adherence Clinic (MTAC) was \nintroduced. These clinics are conducted by pharmacists in collaboration with doctors and other healthcare providers to improve HF management. The objectives of the Heart Failure MTAC are:\n509\n Enhance patient’s adherence to HF pharmacotherapy and non-pharmacological  \n interventions.\n To reduce unscheduled emergency department visits or hospitalisations of HF  \n patient due to acute decompensation.\n To provide consultative service to doctors on evidence-based HF pharmacotherapy  \n and related issues.\n To collaborate with doctors and other health care professionals in HF management  \n program.9.2 MONITORING AND FOLLOW-UP \nPatients with HF require regular follow-up and monitoring. Serial evaluations serve \nto assess a patient’s status, response to therapy, development of complications and disease progression. Key components of assessment include:\n Functional capacity - NYHA functional class or 6-minute walk test \n Fluid status and body weight \n Blood pressure, heart rate and rhythm \n Examination of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems\n Cognitive status and nutritional status \n Review of pharmacotherapy - uptitration, compliance and side effects\n Serum urea, electrolytes, creatinine and eGFR as necessary\n Diet and sodium intake\n Consumption of alcohol or illicit drugs\n Smoking history.\nThe frequency of follow-up will depend on the patient’s clinical stability and need for pharmacotherapy optimisation. A patient with a recent episode of decompensation or clinical instability, for instance, should ideally be seen again soon, usually within 2 weeks. Ultimately, the intensity and type of follow-up would be determined by the local organisation of care and resources.\nRoutine serial echocardiogram is not recommended. However, if there has been a \nrecent change in clinical status or if the patient has received treatment that might significantly change certain echocardiographic parameters, a follow-up echocardiogram is reasonable to assess the LVEF and structural remodeling.\nSerial brain natriuretic peptide measurements to guide and tailor HF therapy cannot \nbe broadly recommended at the present time due to a lack of consistent evidence.\n29-32 \n9.3 CARDIOLOGY REFERRAL \nHF patients with stable symptoms may be managed at the primary care level. \nReferral to the cardiologist should be considered in the following situations: \n De novo HF for a comprehensive workup to confirm the diagnosis and determine  \n the aetiology, and to devise a management plan.\n Episodes of acute decompensation.\n Worsening HF symptoms despite appropriate therapy. \n HF complicated with symptomatic hypotension or excessive bradycardia, limiting \n uptitration of pharmacotherapy. Symptomatic stable CAD and/or acute coronary syndrome for consideration of  \n revascularisation (PCI or CABG). \n Resuscitated cardiac arrest.\n Documented or suspected significant arrhythmias e.g. AF, VT.\n Significant valvular disease not previously assessed or worsening valvular  \n dysfunction.\n Pre-conception assessment and counselling of women with significant structural  \n heart disease and a past history of HF or LV dysfunction. \n Complex congenital cardiac lesions and/or Eisenmenger’s syndrome.\nDespite taking conventional HF therapy, patients may seek alternative therapy and healing approaches that are not considered as allopathic medicine. The National Centre for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) defines complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) as a group of diverse medical and healthcare interventions, practices, products or disciplines that are not generally considered part of conventional medicine.\n10.1 Enhanced External Counter Pulsation (EECP)\nThere is inadequate evidence of clinical effectiveness of EECP in HF.\n510-513 There is \nconcern that it could precipitate or exacerbate HF. \n10.2 Stem cell therapy\nA global position paper on cardiovascular regenerative medicine stated that \ncell-based therapy in HF patients is neither positive nor consistent.514 \n10.3 Omega 3 fatty acids\nIn patients with HFrEF, it may be considered as an adjunctive therapy based on a \nsingle randomised controlled trial (RCT) which showed a small benefit in CV death and/or hospitalisations.\n515,516 10.4 Coenzyme Q10\nThere is no convincing evidence to support or refute the use of coenzyme Q10 for \npatients with HF.517\n10.5 Tai Chi\nTai Chi may improve 6 min walk test distance, quality of life and LVEF in patients with \nHF.518,519 Its effect on hard CV outcomes such as rehospitalisation, MI and mortality \nis not known. \n10.6 YogaA meta-analysis in 2014 that includes two RCTs concluded that yoga improved peak \nVO2 (exercise capacity) and quality of life in chronic HF patients.\n520 There is an \nongoing RCT to look at the effect of yoga in HFpEF patients.521\nThe focus of future development for HF in Malaysia should be towards service \nenhancement working to meet the World Heart Federation mandate of a 25% reduction in premature non-communicable disease mortality by 2025. \nFinding the balance between costs and quality remains a global challenge, and the \nunderstanding of the disease in our healthcare context is imperative to making sure we move forward regarding service delivery, human resource allocation, medical expense costs and patient outcomes. To achieve this, the following need to be undertaken: \n Epidemiological studies to understand the disease profile in the country.\n Establishment and expansion of HFCs leading to more patient-centred HF care.\n Expanding service delivery, human resource allocation, medical expense cost  \n and patient outcomes.\n Education of healthcare personnel.\nEfforts should be directed to the knowledge and understanding of the epidemiology of HF in our country, its phenotype, presentation, current adherence to guideline-directed therapy and outcomes. Regular cluster sampling cohorts or a nationwide registry should be considered. Understanding the limitations of service delivery albeit geography or human resources and making plans for better service delivery systems \nare important.\nDevelopment of HFCs, can lead to a more patient-centric HF care. (See Section 9, Pages 110-113)\nModules for HF care need to be initiated in order to train and educate general \ninternal medicine physicians. A core-curriculum for education needs to be formed to ensure adequate training has been disseminated to HFC personnel.   \nIncentives regarding HF guidelines compliance should be implemented and HF \ninnovative practice should be encouraged with awards for best clinical practice and innovation be made available. \nThis streamline approach to HF care with engagement of connected groups hopefully \nwill help in better overall patient care and experience.\nPerformance measures should be used with the goal of improving quality of care for HF.\n518,519\nProcess performance measures focus on the aspects of care that are delivered to a patient, \nwhile outcome measures focus on the end-points such as mortality or hospitalisation.\nProcess performance indicators for in-patients with HF includes:522-524\n % of patients who had documentation of NYHA Functional Class.\n % of patients who had LVEF measurement.\n % of patients with current or prior LVEF < 40% and without contraindications  \n discharged with ACE-I/ARB. \n % of patients with current or prior LVEF < 40% and without contraindications  \n discharged on β-blockers.\n % of patients with current or prior LVEF < 40% and without contraindications  \n discharged on MRA.\n % of patients with chronic or paroxysmal AF/atrial flutter without contraindications  \n on anticoagulant therapy at discharge.\n % of patients given a post discharge appointment.\nThe accepted performance measure should be more than 60%.Outcome measures indicators include:\n In-hospital mortality\n 30-day readmission for HF\nRefer to Appendix VI, Page 121 for calculation of these measures."

        "text": "1048.5.5 CARDIO-ONCOLOGY AND HEART FAILURE\nHeart disease and cancer are often linked due to:\n Common risk factors (e.g. increasing age and cigarette smoking)\n Treatment strategies \n  Chemotherapy drugs has been associated with HF, arrhythmias,  \n  vasculitis and thromboembolic disease.\n  Radiotherapy of the mediastinum and left chest can lead to CAD,  \n  myopericardial fibrosis and valvular dysfunction.\nDyspnoea in cancer patients could be due to:\n Fluid overload.\n Cardiomyopathy due to chemotherapeutic agents, stress (Takotsubo), or  \n underlying CAD.\n The primary cancer causing anaemia, lung and pericardial involvement. \nChemotherapy-induced cardiomyopathy is not common, clinical HF occurs in \n1-5% and an asymptomatic decrease in LV function in the range of 5% to 20%.\n442 Prognosis in the patients who develop HF is poor.443\nThe anthracycline class of chemotherapeutic agents remain the major cause of chemotherapy-induced cardiomyopathy.\n444,445 In the current era, newer \nagents have also been implicated in a reversible form of cardiomyopathy.446 \nChemotherapy-induced cardiomyopathy as defined by the Cardiac Review and Evaluation Committee is the presence of at least one or more of the following:\n447\n1. Cardiomyopathy characterised by a decrease in Ejection Fraction (EF)  \n globally or due to regional changes in interventricular septum contraction. \n2. Symptoms of HF.3. Signs associated with HF including but not limited to S3 gallop, tachycardia,  \n or both.4. Decline in initial EF of at least 5% to < 55% with signs and symptoms of  \n HF or asymptomatic decrease in EF of at least 10% to < 55%.Chemotherapy drugs that have been associated with HF include (Appendix V, Page120):\n Doxorubicin \n  5% at a cumulative dose of 400mg/m2 (the higher the cumulative dose, \n  the greater the risk of HF.445  \n  Even at lower doses of 180 to 240mg/m2, subclinical events can  \n  occur in up to 30% of patients about 13 years post treatment.448\n  These suggest that there is no ‘safe’ dose for doxorubicin. \n Cyclophosphamide especially in high doses and ifosfomide.449,450  \n Newer agents such as monoclonal antibodies (trastuzumab and pertuzumab), \n small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (imatinib, sunitinib, sorafenib)  \n and the proteasome inhibitor (bortezomib).  Trastuzumab especially when administered together with anthracyclines \n  and cyclophosphamide, has been associated with an increased incidence \n  of HF of 27% compared to 1.7% to 4.1% when anthracycline was not part  \n  of the therapeutic regimen.\n451-453 Symptoms are usually mild to moderate \n  and improve following medical management and termination of drug  \n  administration. Improvement is usually seen in about 4-6 weeks after    withdrawal of the agent.\n454-456 After symptomatic improvement, \n  reinstitution  of treatment is usually possible.454-456\n  Vascular endothelial growth factor signaling pathway (VSP) inhibitors  \n  (bevacizumab) can cause hypertension. Bevacizumab also blocks  \n  receptors that are involved in the compensatory response to stress in  \n  the cardiomyocytes and when the heart is unable to compensate for  \n  the hypertension, it could lead to HF.457,458 Maintaining good blood pressure \n  control can prevent HF associated with this agent. Heart failure due to  \n  VSP inhibitors is usually reversible with cessation of the agent.459\nOne must consider both the efficacy and the toxicity in choosing chemotherapeutic agents. Many of the newer targeted agents cause a reversible form of HF and symptoms usually resolve after the initiation of anti-failure medications.\n454-456,459,460 \nRisk factors for anthracycline toxicity include: 461-465\n The total cumulative dose\n Intravenous bolus administration versus infusion\n Higher single doses\n History of prior irradiation\n Use of concomitant agents known to have cardiotoxicity\n Female gender\n Underlying CV disease\n Age (young and elderly)\n An increase in cardiac biomarkers such as troponins during and   after administration is an indication of toxicity.8.5.5.1 Management\n Patients undergoing chemotherapy should have a careful clinical evaluation \n and assessment and treatment of CV risk factors.464,465\n Blood pressure control is important in all patients especially in those  \n being considered for VSP inhibitors.\n All patients with potential cardiotoxic chemotherapy should have an  \n echocardiogram prior to treatment. An important parameter is the LVEF  \n determined using the biplane method of discs (Simpson’s method) or  \n three-dimensional echocardiography where available. Newer techniques   to detect and quantitate regional and global myocardial dysfunction  \n (strain assessment with global longitudinal strain) can be used to detect  \n pre-clinical and subtle changes in function.\n466-469 \n Biomarkers such as troponin and natriuretic peptides can help identify  \n patients at higher risk.462,463,470,471 \nClose collaboration between the oncologist and the cardiologist is important. \nFor the oncologists, the strategy (prior to commencement) includes:465\n Identifying high risk patients (pre-existing heart disease, presence of  \n CV risk factors, age - young and old, female gender, use of high dose  \n anthracycline regimens).\n High risk patients should:\n  Have a pre-treatment cardiac function evaluation. If the LVEF is < 50%,  \n  refer to the cardiologist.  Be considered for non-cardiotoxic alternatives. \n  Have their therapy protocols adjusted where necessary (e.g. reduction \n  in doses, continuous infusions rather than bolus injections, liposomal    doxorubicin, dexrazoxane etc). \nFor the cardiologists/general physicians, the strategy includes:\n Treating CV risk factors. \n Assessing, repeating (if necessary) imaging studies. (e.g. using high  \n quality LVEF measurement, strain evaluation etc).\n Assessing cardiac biomarkers (troponin and/or NP).\n Considering cardio-protection prior to/or during treatment using β-blockers,  \n MRA and/or ACE-I/ARB if:69,465,472-474\n  EF < 50%, \n  EF drops by > 10%\n  Abnormal global longitudinal strain (GLS) (> 15% drop).  Monitoring LVEF during therapy is important with repeat echocardiography  \n at 3-monthly intervals and/or according to symptoms. If cardioprotective  \n medications are given, monitoring may be necessary at closer intervals of  \n time depending on the clinical condition of the patient e.g. 1-monthly interval. \n Withholding cardiotoxic therapy only as a last resort. (for anthracycline  \n LVEF < 45%, for anti-HER2 therapy LVEF < 40%).\n Monitoring even after completion of therapy:\n  Obtain post therapy LVEF.\n  Repeat echocardiography in 6 months or 1 year. Most cases of  \n  treatment-associated cardiac dysfunction develop within the first year  \n  after completion of therapy.475,476 \n  If EF remains abnormal, follow guidelines for management of HF.465 \n \n8.5.6 HEART FAILURE AND KIDNEY DYSFUNCTION\n8.5.6.1 Epidemiology, definitions and classifications Cardiac and pre-existing kidney disease at admission frequently co-exist, \nvarying from 45.4% in patients with chronic HF to > 60% in those with AHF.\n477,478 \nIn addition, during treatment of AHF, a significant proportion of patients will develop varying degrees of worsening renal function (WRF).\nThe definition of WRF is:\n479\n An increase in serum creatinine by ≥ 26.5μmol/ L (0.3mg/dl) and/or\n A ≥ 25% increase in serum creatinine or a ≥ 20% drop in eGFR.\nThe rise in serum creatinine usually occurs in the first three to five days of \nhospitalisation. The incidence of WRF is estimated to be between 19 and 45%.165 This large \nobserved range is due to variations in the definitions of WRF, the observed \ntime-at-risk and the study population.165 \nRisk factors for WRF during admission for HF include:480\n A prior history of HF or diabetes, \n An admission serum creatinine of > 133μmol/L,  or \n Systolic blood pressure > 160mmHg. \nWRF may fulfill criteria for type 1 or type 2 cardiorenal syndrome (CRS). The term “cardiorenal syndrome” refers to disorders of the heart and kidneys whereby acute or chronic dysfunction in one organ may induce acute or chronic dysfunction of the other.\n165 \nThis syndrome has been classified by the Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative working group into 5 subtypes as shown in Table 17, Page 105.\n165 Many \npatients however, may belong to more than one subtype and may move between subtypes during the course of their disease.\n165\n8.5.6.2. Pathogenesis of CRS \nMultiple mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of CRS. These include:\n Increased renal venous pressure  - venous congestion is probably the  \n most important factor.481 \n RV dysfunction.\n Reduced renal perfusion with reduced cardiac output. \n Neurohumoral adaptations (e.g. activation of the sympathetic nervous  \n system and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, increases in  \n vasopressin and endothelin-1).8.5.6.3  Clinical significance /Impact of kidney dysfunction in HF  The combination of cardiac and kidney disease increases the complexity and \ncosts of care, and may interact to worsen prognosis. \nA. Pharmacologic considerations \n Safety:\n  Dosing of renally-excreted cardiac drugs need adjustment in the  \n  presence of renal impairment (e.g. digoxin, insulin, low molecular  \n  weight heparin).\n  Patients with HF are at increased risk of contrast-induced acute kidney \n  injury. \n Efficacy:\n  Impaired renal function will affect drug choices and dosing. If eGFR <  \n  30mls/min/1.73m2, most thiazide diuretics are no longer effective and  \n  loop diuretics are preferred. Higher doses of loop diuretics may be   \n  required with increasing renal impairment.             B. Prognostic implications\n Preexisting CKD is a bad prognostic indicator in patients with HF - the  \n more severe the CKD, the worse the mortality.482,483\n In patients with HF, WRF may not always indicate a poor outcome.484 The  \n prognostic value of WRF is mainly determined by:   The presence of persistent congestion  \n  Baseline renal function and magnitude of renal changes \n  Duration - persistent WRF is usually associated with hemodynamic  \n  derangements and poor prognosis as compared with transient WRF  \n  as a result of agressive decongestive therapy.\n485-487\nTable 17: Classification of Cardiorenal Syndrome (CRS)8.5.6.4. Management \n A multi-disciplinary approach is recommended. Early referral to a  \n nephrologist is advisable.   \n Exclude potentially reversible causes for increasing renal dysfunction  \n such as hyper - or hypovolaemia, concomitant medications such as  \n aminoglycosides and NSAIDs, ACE-I or ARB and renal artery stenosis. \n Closely monitor electrolytes and kidney function, especially during acute  \n illnesses, dehydration and when increasing doses of cardiac drugs  \n including diuretics. The baseline renal function will determine how frequently \n this should be done. \n The recommended range for serum potassium is 4-5.5mmol/L.488 \n Wherever possible, avoid nephrotoxins, e.g. contrast media for angiography\n Intravenous diuretics \n  Loop diuretics are the first choice.\n  Continuous infusion may not have greater benefits compared with  \n  bolus dosing.115-118,489\n  Start initially with 2-2.5 times the usual oral dose. \n  Combination therapy (loop diuretic and thiazide/thiazide-like diuretic/\n  mineralocorticoid) may be required to enhance diuresis.205-207 However,  \n  care is required to avoid electrolyte disturbances, hypovolaemia and  \n  worsening renal dysfunction. \n Careful use of Renin Angiotensin System (RAS) blockers  \n  HF patients with stable, chronic mild-moderate renal insufficiency  \n  (eGFR > 30mls/min/1.73m2) should receive standard therapy with an  \n  ACE-I/ ARB and an MRA.490\n  A serum creatinine rise or GFR decrease by up to 30% from baseline  \n  may be acceptable before it becomes necessary to consider stopping  \n  or decreasing doses.221 \n  In patients with advanced renal failure, the decision to start or stop  \n  RAS blockers should be individualised.490\n  Consider withholding RAS blockers during aggressive diuresis in  \n  patients at high risk for WRF.  RAS blockers (and β-blockers) can be used in patients with HF who  \n  are on chronic dialysis therapy.\n Ultrafiltration \n  This involves the removal of plasma water across a semi-permeable  \n  membrane in response to a transmembrane pressure gradient.   It may be considered for congestive symptoms refractory to diuresis,  \n  but should be used in consultation with a nephrologist.\n491\n  Evidence for its efficacy in fluid removal is mixed at present.491  Haemodialysis \n  Criteria for possible need to initiate renal replacement therapy include:\n   Oliguria unresponsive to fluid resuscitation.\n   Severe hyperkalaemia (serum potassium > 6.5mmol/L).\n   Severe acidaemia (pH < 7.2). \n   Serum urea > 25mmol/L. \n    Serum creatinine > 300μmol/L. \n8.6  ADVANCED HEART FAILURE/REFRACTORY HEART FAILURE\nThese are patients with severe symptoms of HF despite maximal medical \ntherapy. Hospital admission is necessary for stabilisation. Meticulous control of fluid balance is important. Aggravating causes of HF as listed in Table 5, Page 39 should be identified and treated.\nThese patients may need specialised treatment in CCU or ICU. The following \nmay be required:\n Intravenous infusion of frusemide. These patients may require combination  \n loop diuretics and thiazides.\n Intravenous infusion of inotropes - low dose dobutamine (5mcg/kg/min) or  \n milrinone. These improve symptoms but no survival benefit has been  \n demonstrated.126,492\n Ultrafiltration in patients who are fluid overloaded.493 In most patients,  \n however, the relief is temporary.\nThe prognosis of these patients is poor. They should be referred to assess \nwhether they may be potential candidates for mechanical circulatory support (e.g. LVAD) and consideration for heart transplant.\n8.6.1 HEART TRANSPLANTHeart transplantation is a well-established treatment of refractory end stage \nHF. This definitive therapy for HF however is limited by the lack of donor organs.\n494,495All patients with severe symptomatic HF despite optimal medical therapy and no other alternative therapy option should be considered for heart transplant. They need to be referred to a HF specialist cardiac hospital for further evaluation.\nAssessment for heart transplant is done by a multispeciality, multidisciplinary \nteam and appropriate work up will be performed for eligibility.\nEligibility criteria to be considered for heart transplant include:\n Poor LVEF (< 25%).\n Recurrent HF hospitalisations.\n Major limitation of the patient’s daily activities.\n Poor effort tolerance i.e. peak VO2 (maximal oxygen consumption or  \n peak oxygen uptake) less than 10ml/kg/min (or < 50% predicted). VO2  \n max is the maximum rate of oxygen consumption measured during  \n incremental exercise ie exercise of increasing intensity and is widely  \n used as an indicator of cardiorespiratory fitness.\n Intravenous inotropic dependence for symptomatic relief or to maintain  \n end organ function.\n Motivated, psychologically stable and compliant to therapy.\nContraindications to heart transplant\n Active infection.\n Severe peripheral arterial or cerebrovascular disease.\n Malignancy within 5 years.\n Diabetes mellitus with widespread microvascular complications.\n Systemic disease with multi-organ dysfunction.\n Irreversible chronic kidney, liver or lung disease.\n Pharmacologically irreversible pulmonary hypertension.\n Other medical or psychosocial issues that would impact survival.\n8.6.2 MECHANICAL CIRCULATORY SUPPORT The use of mechanical circulatory support (e.g. LVAD), should be considered \nfor patients with potentially reversible or treatable conditions or as a bridge to heart transplant in suitable candidates.\nLVAD may also be used as destination therapy in candidates who are not \nsuitable for transplant. Patients have improvement in their symptoms when compared to optimal medical therapy.\n496,497 However, the rate of rehospitalisations \ndue to complications of bleeding, thrombosis and infections are high.496-498 \nMany patients also go into major depression. Thus, extensive discussion with the patient and family is necessary prior to LVAD implantation.8.7 PALLIATIVE AND END OF LIFE CARE\nDespite recent advances in therapy, for some patients, HF remains a \nprogressive disease and carries a poor prognosis. Patients with refractory symptoms despite guideline-directed medical therapy, should be considered for palliative and end of life care if they have the following characteristics:\n499\n Progressive functional decline (mental and physical) and dependence in  \n most activities of daily living.\n Severe HF symptoms with poor quality of life despite optimal pharmacological \n and non-pharmacological therapies.\n Frequent hospital admissions or serious episodes of decompensation  \n despite optimal therapies.\n Heart transplantation and mechanical circulatory support ruled out.\n Cardiac cachexia.\n Clinically judged to be near end of life.\nThe aim of palliative care in HF is to prevent and relieve suffering and to promote the best quality of life for patients and their families.\n500\nDespite the complexities of end-of-life issues in HF patients, there is minimal evidence-based guidance on the care of this population.\n501 The key components \nof end-of-life care are:\n 1. Advanced care plan with directives and informed decisions on:\n   Use or withdrawal of treatment including advanced therapies such  \n   as V inotropes, ICD and mechanical circulatory support. \n   When it would be appropriate to switch off devices such as ICD or  \n   CRT. \n   Resuscitation status.\n   Preferred location of death (i.e. at home or hospital).\n 2. Symptom management \n  Goals of care at this stage should shift from extending life to controlling \n  symptoms and maximising quality of life. Common symptoms include:\n   Dyspnoea\n   Fatigue\n   Pain\n   Urinary retention \n  Constipation\n  Cachexia\n  Depression\n Medications that may be useful include analgesics, antiemetics, anxiolytics,  \n opioids, laxatives, and diuretics, etc. \n3. Psychosocial support\n The impact of HF on quality of life for the patient and family is complex and  \n extends beyond physical symptoms.502\n Emotional, spiritual and social support should be provided to alleviate patient  \n anxiety about dying, and to guide patient towards a peaceful journey at the end  \n of life.\n9.1 LEVEL OF CARE AND SHARED MANAGEMENT \nThe care of patients with HF should ideally take place in a multidisciplinary system, \nallowing for shared care between the hospital (secondary or tertiary settings) and \ncommunity (primary setting). A multidisciplinary approach encompasses patient \neducation, cardiac rehabilitation, psychosocial support and palliative care, and has been proven to reduce HF hospitalisations and mortality in discharged patients.\n503-505\nThe multidisciplinary team usually consists of cardiologists and or general physicians, HF nurses, pharmacists, dieticians, physiotherapists, primary care \nproviders, social workers as well as geriatricians, psychologists, occupational \ntherapists and when necessary, palliative care specialists. Care can be done in two different settings: \n In the patient’s own home - home-based interventions are associated with  \n significantly lower healthcare costs, reduced hospital readmissions and an  \n improvement in the patient’s quality of life.506 This may however, not be feasible  \n in our local setting.\n Specialist outpatient clinic - the Heart Failure Clinic (HFC). \nHFCs can either be:\n Nurse-directed - these are run by nurses with special training in HF.\n Physician-directed - run by general physicians and/or cardiologists. \nHFCs can be established in the tertiary hospitals or in the primary care setting. The minimum human resource requirements are a:\n Cardiologist or general physician with an interest in cardiology and HF, \n Dedicated nurse and \n Medical technologist for blood taking, doing echocardiography and 6 minutes \n walk tests.In bigger clinic settings, the involvement of physiotherapists to encourage physical \nactivity, pharmacists and counsellors for end of life care would be advisable.\nThese clinics will be the intermediary between in-patient hospital care and community \nprimary care. Patients who can be seen in these clinics include those:507\n Recently discharged after an admission for decompensated HF (a waiting \n time of 7-12 days post discharge has to be the maximum wait-time).\n Who are in the early decompensation phase and need treatment modification.\n Who are stable but need uptitration of HF medications.\n With ICD or CRTs. \n With comorbidities, such as renal dysfunction, diabetes and COPD.\n With advanced HF who may benefit from:\n  Heart transplant\n  Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD)\n  Palliative care.\nThe objectives of these HF clinics may vary based on local settings. These include:\n507,508\n Optimisation of medical therapy particularly the uptitration of β-blockers, ACE-I  \n and MRA. \n Education of the patient and caregiver on the nature of the disease and its  \n progression. \n Promotion of self-care such as :\n  Compliance to medical therapy and fluid restriction.\n  Regular weighing and adjusting diuretic doses according to symptoms and  \n  body weight.\nPatient with optimised HF medications/treatment plans can be discharged to the \ncommunity with appropriate care plans to primary care. Close partnership between these HF clinics and primary care helps to reduce unnecessary admissions to hospital. \nIn 2018, the Heart Failure Medication Therapy Adherence Clinic (MTAC) was \nintroduced. These clinics are conducted by pharmacists in collaboration with doctors and other healthcare providers to improve HF management. The objectives of the Heart Failure MTAC are:\n509\n Enhance patient’s adherence to HF pharmacotherapy and non-pharmacological  \n interventions.\n To reduce unscheduled emergency department visits or hospitalisations of HF  \n patient due to acute decompensation.\n To provide consultative service to doctors on evidence-based HF pharmacotherapy  \n and related issues.\n To collaborate with doctors and other health care professionals in HF management  \n program.9.2 MONITORING AND FOLLOW-UP \nPatients with HF require regular follow-up and monitoring. Serial evaluations serve \nto assess a patient’s status, response to therapy, development of complications and disease progression. Key components of assessment include:\n Functional capacity - NYHA functional class or 6-minute walk test \n Fluid status and body weight \n Blood pressure, heart rate and rhythm \n Examination of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems\n Cognitive status and nutritional status \n Review of pharmacotherapy - uptitration, compliance and side effects\n Serum urea, electrolytes, creatinine and eGFR as necessary\n Diet and sodium intake\n Consumption of alcohol or illicit drugs\n Smoking history.\nThe frequency of follow-up will depend on the patient’s clinical stability and need for pharmacotherapy optimisation. A patient with a recent episode of decompensation or clinical instability, for instance, should ideally be seen again soon, usually within 2 weeks. Ultimately, the intensity and type of follow-up would be determined by the local organisation of care and resources.\nRoutine serial echocardiogram is not recommended. However, if there has been a \nrecent change in clinical status or if the patient has received treatment that might significantly change certain echocardiographic parameters, a follow-up echocardiogram is reasonable to assess the LVEF and structural remodeling.\nSerial brain natriuretic peptide measurements to guide and tailor HF therapy cannot \nbe broadly recommended at the present time due to a lack of consistent evidence.\n29-32 \n9.3 CARDIOLOGY REFERRAL \nHF patients with stable symptoms may be managed at the primary care level. \nReferral to the cardiologist should be considered in the following situations: \n De novo HF for a comprehensive workup to confirm the diagnosis and determine  \n the aetiology, and to devise a management plan.\n Episodes of acute decompensation.\n Worsening HF symptoms despite appropriate therapy. \n HF complicated with symptomatic hypotension or excessive bradycardia, limiting \n uptitration of pharmacotherapy. Symptomatic stable CAD and/or acute coronary syndrome for consideration of  \n revascularisation (PCI or CABG). \n Resuscitated cardiac arrest.\n Documented or suspected significant arrhythmias e.g. AF, VT.\n Significant valvular disease not previously assessed or worsening valvular  \n dysfunction.\n Pre-conception assessment and counselling of women with significant structural  \n heart disease and a past history of HF or LV dysfunction. \n Complex congenital cardiac lesions and/or Eisenmenger’s syndrome.\nDespite taking conventional HF therapy, patients may seek alternative therapy and healing approaches that are not considered as allopathic medicine. The National Centre for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) defines complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) as a group of diverse medical and healthcare interventions, practices, products or disciplines that are not generally considered part of conventional medicine.\n10.1 Enhanced External Counter Pulsation (EECP)\nThere is inadequate evidence of clinical effectiveness of EECP in HF.\n510-513 There is \nconcern that it could precipitate or exacerbate HF. \n10.2 Stem cell therapy\nA global position paper on cardiovascular regenerative medicine stated that \ncell-based therapy in HF patients is neither positive nor consistent.514 \n10.3 Omega 3 fatty acids\nIn patients with HFrEF, it may be considered as an adjunctive therapy based on a \nsingle randomised controlled trial (RCT) which showed a small benefit in CV death and/or hospitalisations.\n515,516 10.4 Coenzyme Q10\nThere is no convincing evidence to support or refute the use of coenzyme Q10 for \npatients with HF.517\n10.5 Tai Chi\nTai Chi may improve 6 min walk test distance, quality of life and LVEF in patients with \nHF.518,519 Its effect on hard CV outcomes such as rehospitalisation, MI and mortality \nis not known. \n10.6 YogaA meta-analysis in 2014 that includes two RCTs concluded that yoga improved peak \nVO2 (exercise capacity) and quality of life in chronic HF patients.\n520 There is an \nongoing RCT to look at the effect of yoga in HFpEF patients.521\nThe focus of future development for HF in Malaysia should be towards service \nenhancement working to meet the World Heart Federation mandate of a 25% reduction in premature non-communicable disease mortality by 2025. \nFinding the balance between costs and quality remains a global challenge, and the \nunderstanding of the disease in our healthcare context is imperative to making sure we move forward regarding service delivery, human resource allocation, medical expense costs and patient outcomes. To achieve this, the following need to be undertaken: \n Epidemiological studies to understand the disease profile in the country.\n Establishment and expansion of HFCs leading to more patient-centred HF care.\n Expanding service delivery, human resource allocation, medical expense cost  \n and patient outcomes.\n Education of healthcare personnel.\nEfforts should be directed to the knowledge and understanding of the epidemiology of HF in our country, its phenotype, presentation, current adherence to guideline-directed therapy and outcomes. Regular cluster sampling cohorts or a nationwide registry should be considered. Understanding the limitations of service delivery albeit geography or human resources and making plans for better service delivery systems \nare important.\nDevelopment of HFCs, can lead to a more patient-centric HF care. (See Section 9, Pages 110-113)\nModules for HF care need to be initiated in order to train and educate general \ninternal medicine physicians. A core-curriculum for education needs to be formed to ensure adequate training has been disseminated to HFC personnel.   \nIncentives regarding HF guidelines compliance should be implemented and HF \ninnovative practice should be encouraged with awards for best clinical practice and innovation be made available. \nThis streamline approach to HF care with engagement of connected groups hopefully \nwill help in better overall patient care and experience.\nPerformance measures should be used with the goal of improving quality of care for HF.\n518,519\nProcess performance measures focus on the aspects of care that are delivered to a patient, \nwhile outcome measures focus on the end-points such as mortality or hospitalisation.\nProcess performance indicators for in-patients with HF includes:522-524\n % of patients who had documentation of NYHA Functional Class.\n % of patients who had LVEF measurement.\n % of patients with current or prior LVEF < 40% and without contraindications  \n discharged with ACE-I/ARB. \n % of patients with current or prior LVEF < 40% and without contraindications  \n discharged on β-blockers.\n % of patients with current or prior LVEF < 40% and without contraindications  \n discharged on MRA.\n % of patients with chronic or paroxysmal AF/atrial flutter without contraindications  \n on anticoagulant therapy at discharge.\n % of patients given a post discharge appointment.\nThe accepted performance measure should be more than 60%.Outcome measures indicators include:\n In-hospital mortality\n 30-day readmission for HF\nRefer to Appendix VI, Page 121 for calculation of these measures."

Cardiomyopathy characterised by a decrease in Ejection Fraction (EF)  \n globally or due to regional changes in interventricular septum contraction. \n2. Symptoms of HF.3. Signs associated with HF including but not limited to S3 gallop, tachycardia,  \n or both.4. Decline in initial EF of at least 5% to < 55% with signs and symptoms of  \n HF or asymptomatic decrease in EF of at least 10% to < 55%.Chemotherapy drugs that have been associated with HF include (Appendix V, Page120):\n Doxorubicin \n  5% at a cumulative dose of 400mg/m2 (the higher the cumulative dose, \n  the greater the risk of HF.445  \n  Even at lower doses of 180 to 240mg/m2, subclinical events can  \n  occur in up to 30% of patients about 13 years post treatment.448\n  These suggest that there is no ‘safe’ dose for doxorubicin. \n Cyclophosphamide especially in high doses and ifosfomide.449,450  \n Newer agents such as monoclonal antibodies (trastuzumab and pertuzumab), \n small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (imatinib, sunitinib, sorafenib)  \n and the proteasome inhibitor (bortezomib).  Trastuzumab especially when administered together with anthracyclines \n  and cyclophosphamide, has been associated with an increased incidence \n  of HF of 27% compared to 1.7% to 4.1% when anthracycline was not part  \n  of the therapeutic regimen.\n451-453 Symptoms are usually mild to moderate \n  and improve following medical management and termination of drug  \n  administration. Improvement is usually seen in about 4-6 weeks after    withdrawal of the agent.\n454-456 After symptomatic improvement, \n  reinstitution  of treatment is usually possible.454-456\n  Vascular endothelial growth factor signaling pathway (VSP) inhibitors  \n  (bevacizumab) can cause hypertension. Bevacizumab also blocks  \n  receptors that are involved in the compensatory response to stress in  \n  the cardiomyocytes and when the heart is unable to compensate for  \n  the hypertension, it could lead to HF.457,458 Maintaining good blood pressure \n  control can prevent HF associated with this agent. Heart failure due to  \n  VSP inhibitors is usually reversible with cessation of the agent.459\nOne must consider both the efficacy and the toxicity in choosing chemotherapeutic agents. Many of the newer targeted agents cause a reversible form of HF and symptoms usually resolve after the initiation of anti-failure medications.\n454-456,459,460 \nRisk factors for anthracycline toxicity include: 461-465\n The total cumulative dose\n Intravenous bolus administration versus infusion\n Higher single doses\n History of prior irradiation\n Use of concomitant agents known to have cardiotoxicity\n Female gender\n Underlying CV disease\n Age (young and elderly)\n An increase in cardiac biomarkers such as troponins during and   after administration is an indication of toxicity.8.5.5.1 Management\n Patients undergoing chemotherapy should have a careful clinical evaluation \n and assessment and treatment of CV risk factors.464,465\n Blood pressure control is important in all patients especially in those  \n being considered for VSP inhibitors.\n All patients with potential cardiotoxic chemotherapy should have an  \n echocardiogram prior to treatment. An important parameter is the LVEF  \n determined using the biplane method of discs (Simpson’s method) or  \n three-dimensional echocardiography where available. Newer techniques   to detect and quantitate regional and global myocardial dysfunction  \n (strain assessment with global longitudinal strain) can be used to detect  \n pre-clinical and subtle changes in function.\n466-469 \n Biomarkers such as troponin and natriuretic peptides can help identify  \n patients at higher risk.462,463,470,471 \nClose collaboration between the oncologist and the cardiologist is important. \nFor the oncologists, the strategy (prior to commencement) includes:465\n Identifying high risk patients (pre-existing heart disease, presence of  \n CV risk factors, age - young and old, female gender, use of high dose  \n anthracycline regimens).\n High risk patients should:\n  Have a pre-treatment cardiac function evaluation. If the LVEF is < 50%,  \n  refer to the cardiologist.  Be considered for non-cardiotoxic alternatives. \n  Have their therapy protocols adjusted where necessary (e.g. reduction \n  in doses, continuous infusions rather than bolus injections, liposomal    doxorubicin, dexrazoxane etc). \nFor the cardiologists/general physicians, the strategy includes:\n Treating CV risk factors. \n Assessing, repeating (if necessary) imaging studies. (e.g. using high  \n quality LVEF measurement, strain evaluation etc).\n Assessing cardiac biomarkers (troponin and/or NP).\n Considering cardio-protection prior to/or during treatment using β-blockers,  \n MRA and/or ACE-I/ARB if:69,465,472-474\n  EF < 50%, \n  EF drops by > 10%\n  Abnormal global longitudinal strain (GLS) (> 15% drop).  Monitoring LVEF during therapy is important with repeat echocardiography  \n at 3-monthly intervals and/or according to symptoms. If cardioprotective  \n medications are given, monitoring may be necessary at closer intervals of  \n time depending on the clinical condition of the patient e.g. 1-monthly interval. \n Withholding cardiotoxic therapy only as a last resort. (for anthracycline  \n LVEF < 45%, for anti-HER2 therapy LVEF < 40%).\n Monitoring even after completion of therapy:\n  Obtain post therapy LVEF.\n  Repeat echocardiography in 6 months or 1 year. Most cases of  \n  treatment-associated cardiac dysfunction develop within the first year  \n  after completion of therapy.475,476 \n  If EF remains abnormal, follow guidelines for management of HF.465 \n \n8.5.6 HEART FAILURE AND KIDNEY DYSFUNCTION\n8.5.6.1 Epidemiology, definitions and classifications Cardiac and pre-existing kidney disease at admission frequently co-exist, \nvarying from 45.4% in patients with chronic HF to > 60% in those with AHF.\n477,478 \nIn addition, during treatment of AHF, a significant proportion of patients will develop varying degrees of worsening renal function (WRF).\nThe definition of WRF is:\n479\n An increase in serum creatinine by ≥ 26.5μmol/ L (0.3mg/dl) and/or\n A ≥ 25% increase in serum creatinine or a ≥ 20% drop in eGFR.\nThe rise in serum creatinine usually occurs in the first three to five days of \nhospitalisation. The incidence of WRF is estimated to be between 19 and 45%.165 This large \nobserved range is due to variations in the definitions of WRF, the observed time-at-risk and the study population.\n165 \nRisk factors for WRF during admission for HF include:480\n A prior history of HF or diabetes, \n An admission serum creatinine of > 133μmol/L,  or \n Systolic blood pressure > 160mmHg. \nWRF may fulfill criteria for type 1 or type 2 cardiorenal syndrome (CRS). The term “cardiorenal syndrome” refers to disorders of the heart and kidneys whereby acute or chronic dysfunction in one organ may induce acute or chronic dysfunction of the other.\n165 \nThis syndrome has been classified by the Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative working group into 5 subtypes as shown in Table 17, Page 105.\n165 Many \npatients however, may belong to more than one subtype and may move between subtypes during the course of their disease.\n165\n8.5.6.2. Pathogenesis of CRS \nMultiple mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of CRS. These include:\n Increased renal venous pressure  - venous congestion is probably the  \n most important factor.481 \n RV dysfunction.\n Reduced renal perfusion with reduced cardiac output. \n Neurohumoral adaptations (e.g. activation of the sympathetic nervous  \n system and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, increases in  \n vasopressin and endothelin-1).8.5.6.3  Clinical significance /Impact of kidney dysfunction in HF  The combination of cardiac and kidney disease increases the complexity and \ncosts of care, and may interact to worsen prognosis. \nA. Pharmacologic considerations \n Safety:\n  Dosing of renally-excreted cardiac drugs need adjustment in the  \n  presence of renal impairment (e.g. digoxin, insulin, low molecular  \n  weight heparin).\n  Patients with HF are at increased risk of contrast-induced acute kidney \n  injury. \n Efficacy:\n  Impaired renal function will affect drug choices and dosing. If eGFR <  \n  30mls/min/1.73m2, most thiazide diuretics are no longer effective and  \n  loop diuretics are preferred. Higher doses of loop diuretics may be   \n  required with increasing renal impairment.    \n         B. Prognostic implications\n Preexisting CKD is a bad prognostic indicator in patients with HF - the  \n more severe the CKD, the worse the mortality.482,483\n In patients with HF, WRF may not always indicate a poor outcome.484 The  \n prognostic value of WRF is mainly determined by:   The presence of persistent congestion  \n  Baseline renal function and magnitude of renal changes \n  Duration - persistent WRF is usually associated with hemodynamic  \n  derangements and poor prognosis as compared with transient WRF  \n  as a result of agressive decongestive therapy.\n485-487\nTable 17: Classification of Cardiorenal Syndrome (CRS)8.5.6.4. Management \n A multi-disciplinary approach is recommended. Early referral to a  \n nephrologist is advisable.   \n Exclude potentially reversible causes for increasing renal dysfunction  \n such as hyper - or hypovolaemia, concomitant medications such as  \n aminoglycosides and NSAIDs, ACE-I or ARB and renal artery stenosis. \n Closely monitor electrolytes and kidney function, especially during acute  \n illnesses, dehydration and when increasing doses of cardiac drugs  \n including diuretics. The baseline renal function will determine how frequently \n this should be done. \n The recommended range for serum potassium is 4-5.5mmol/L.488 \n Wherever possible, avoid nephrotoxins, e.g. contrast media for angiography\n Intravenous diuretics \n  Loop diuretics are the first choice.\n  Continuous infusion may not have greater benefits compared with  \n  bolus dosing.115-118,489\n  Start initially with 2-2.5 times the usual oral dose. \n  Combination therapy (loop diuretic and thiazide/thiazide-like diuretic/\n  mineralocorticoid) may be required to enhance diuresis.205-207 However,  \n  care is required to avoid electrolyte disturbances, hypovolaemia and  \n  worsening renal dysfunction. \n Careful use of Renin Angiotensin System (RAS) blockers  \n  HF patients with stable, chronic mild-moderate renal insufficiency  \n  (eGFR > 30mls/min/1.73m2) should receive standard therapy with an  \n  ACE-I/ ARB and an MRA.490\n  A serum creatinine rise or GFR decrease by up to 30% from baseline  \n  may be acceptable before it becomes necessary to consider stopping  \n  or decreasing doses.221 \n  In patients with advanced renal failure, the decision to start or stop  \n  RAS blockers should be individualised.490\n  Consider withholding RAS blockers during aggressive diuresis in  \n  patients at high risk for WRF.  RAS blockers (and β-blockers) can be used in patients with HF who  \n  are on chronic dialysis therapy.\n Ultrafiltration \n  This involves the removal of plasma water across a semi-permeable  \n  membrane in response to a transmembrane pressure gradient.   It may be considered for congestive symptoms refractory to diuresis,  \n  but should be used in consultation with a nephrologist.\n491\n  Evidence for its efficacy in fluid removal is mixed at present.491 Cardiorenal (CRS) Subtypes Description\nCRS Type 1 (acute CRS) Rapid worsening of cardiac function \n leading to acute kidney injury e.g. MI \n with cardiogenic shock.\nCRS Type 2 (chronic CRS) Chronic abnormalities in cardiac  function leading to progressive \n Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) e.g. \n chronic HFrEF or HFpEF.\nCRS Type 3  Worsening of renal function leading \n(acute renocardiac  to acute cardiac dysfunction e.g. in \nsyndrome) Acute Kidney Injury.\nCRS Type 4   Primary chronic kidney disease  \n(chronic renocardiac contributing to decreased cardiac  \nsyndrome) function and an increased risk of CV \n events e.g. CKD leading to LVH, CAD.\nCRS Type 5  Presence of comorbid cardiac and \n(secondary CRS) renal dysfunction due to either acute \n or chronic systemic disease e.g. \n diabetes, sepsis, amyloidosis.\nAdapted from Ronco C, McCullough P, Anker SD, et al. Cardio-renal syndromes: report from the consensus conference of the Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative. Eur Heart J 2010;31:703–11.  Haemodialysis \n  Criteria for possible need to initiate renal replacement therapy include:\n   Oliguria unresponsive to fluid resuscitation.\n   Severe hyperkalaemia (serum potassium > 6.5mmol/L).\n   Severe acidaemia (pH < 7.2). \n   Serum urea > 25mmol/L. \n    Serum creatinine > 300μmol/L. \n8.6  ADVANCED HEART FAILURE/REFRACTORY HEART FAILURE\nThese are patients with severe symptoms of HF despite maximal medical \ntherapy. Hospital admission is necessary for stabilisation. Meticulous control of fluid balance is important. Aggravating causes of HF as listed in Table 5, Page 39 should be identified and treated.\nThese patients may need specialised treatment in CCU or ICU. The following \nmay be required:\n Intravenous infusion of frusemide. These patients may require combination  \n loop diuretics and thiazides.\n Intravenous infusion of inotropes - low dose dobutamine (5mcg/kg/min) or  \n milrinone. These improve symptoms but no survival benefit has been  \n demonstrated.126,492\n Ultrafiltration in patients who are fluid overloaded.493 In most patients,  \n however, the relief is temporary.\nThe prognosis of these patients is poor. They should be referred to assess \nwhether they may be potential candidates for mechanical circulatory support (e.g. LVAD) and consideration for heart transplant.\n8.6.1 HEART TRANSPLANTHeart transplantation is a well-established treatment of refractory end stage \nHF. This definitive therapy for HF however is limited by the lack of donor organs.\n494,495All patients with severe symptomatic HF despite optimal medical therapy and no other alternative therapy option should be considered for heart transplant. They need to be referred to a HF specialist cardiac hospital for further evaluation.\nAssessment for heart transplant is done by a multispeciality, multidisciplinary \nteam and appropriate work up will be performed for eligibility.\nEligibility criteria to be considered for heart transplant include:\n Poor LVEF (< 25%).\n Recurrent HF hospitalisations.\n Major limitation of the patient’s daily activities.\n Poor effort tolerance i.e. peak VO2 (maximal oxygen consumption or  \n peak oxygen uptake) less than 10ml/kg/min (or < 50% predicted). VO2  \n max is the maximum rate of oxygen consumption measured during  \n incremental exercise ie exercise of increasing intensity and is widely  \n used as an indicator of cardiorespiratory fitness.\n Intravenous inotropic dependence for symptomatic relief or to maintain  \n end organ function.\n Motivated, psychologically stable and compliant to therapy.\nContraindications to heart transplant\n Active infection.\n Severe peripheral arterial or cerebrovascular disease.\n Malignancy within 5 years.\n Diabetes mellitus with widespread microvascular complications.\n Systemic disease with multi-organ dysfunction.\n Irreversible chronic kidney, liver or lung disease.\n Pharmacologically irreversible pulmonary hypertension.\n Other medical or psychosocial issues that would impact survival.\n8.6.2 MECHANICAL CIRCULATORY SUPPORT The use of mechanical circulatory support (e.g. LVAD), should be considered \nfor patients with potentially reversible or treatable conditions or as a bridge to heart transplant in suitable candidates.\nLVAD may also be used as destination therapy in candidates who are not \nsuitable for transplant. Patients have improvement in their symptoms when compared to optimal medical therapy.\n496,497 However, the rate of rehospitalisations \ndue to complications of bleeding, thrombosis and infections are high.496-498 \nMany patients also go into major depression. Thus, extensive discussion with the patient and family is necessary prior to LVAD implantation.8.7 PALLIATIVE AND END OF LIFE CARE\nDespite recent advances in therapy, for some patients, HF remains a \nprogressive disease and carries a poor prognosis. Patients with refractory symptoms despite guideline-directed medical therapy, should be considered for palliative and end of life care if they have the following characteristics:\n499\n Progressive functional decline (mental and physical) and dependence in  \n most activities of daily living.\n Severe HF symptoms with poor quality of life despite optimal pharmacological \n and non-pharmacological therapies.\n Frequent hospital admissions or serious episodes of decompensation  \n despite optimal therapies.\n Heart transplantation and mechanical circulatory support ruled out.\n Cardiac cachexia.\n Clinically judged to be near end of life.\nThe aim of palliative care in HF is to prevent and relieve suffering and to promote the best quality of life for patients and their families.\n500\nDespite the complexities of end-of-life issues in HF patients, there is minimal evidence-based guidance on the care of this population.\n501 The key components \nof end-of-life care are:\n 1. Advanced care plan with directives and informed decisions on:\n   Use or withdrawal of treatment including advanced therapies such  \n   as V inotropes, ICD and mechanical circulatory support. \n   When it would be appropriate to switch off devices such as ICD or  \n   CRT. \n   Resuscitation status.\n   Preferred location of death (i.e. at home or hospital).\n 2. Symptom management \n  Goals of care at this stage should shift from extending life to controlling \n  symptoms and maximising quality of life. Common symptoms include:\n   Dyspnoea\n   Fatigue\n   Pain\n   Urinary retention \n  Constipation\n  Cachexia\n  Depression\n Medications that may be useful include analgesics, antiemetics, anxiolytics,  \n opioids, laxatives, and diuretics, etc. \n3. Psychosocial support\n The impact of HF on quality of life for the patient and family is complex and  \n extends beyond physical symptoms.502\n Emotional, spiritual and social support should be provided to alleviate patient  \n anxiety about dying, and to guide patient towards a peaceful journey at the end  \n of life.\n9.1 LEVEL OF CARE AND SHARED MANAGEMENT \nThe care of patients with HF should ideally take place in a multidisciplinary system, \nallowing for shared care between the hospital (secondary or tertiary settings) and \ncommunity (primary setting). A multidisciplinary approach encompasses patient \neducation, cardiac rehabilitation, psychosocial support and palliative care, and has been proven to reduce HF hospitalisations and mortality in discharged patients.\n503-505\nThe multidisciplinary team usually consists of cardiologists and or general physicians, HF nurses, pharmacists, dieticians, physiotherapists, primary care \nproviders, social workers as well as geriatricians, psychologists, occupational \ntherapists and when necessary, palliative care specialists. Care can be done in two different settings: \n In the patient’s own home - home-based interventions are associated with  \n significantly lower healthcare costs, reduced hospital readmissions and an  \n improvement in the patient’s quality of life.506 This may however, not be feasible  \n in our local setting.\n Specialist outpatient clinic - the Heart Failure Clinic (HFC). \nHFCs can either be:\n Nurse-directed - these are run by nurses with special training in HF.\n Physician-directed - run by general physicians and/or cardiologists. \nHFCs can be established in the tertiary hospitals or in the primary care setting. The minimum human resource requirements are a:\n Cardiologist or general physician with an interest in cardiology and HF, \n Dedicated nurse and \n Medical technologist for blood taking, doing echocardiography and 6 minutes \n walk tests.In bigger clinic settings, the involvement of physiotherapists to encourage physical \nactivity, pharmacists and counsellors for end of life care would be advisable.\nThese clinics will be the intermediary between in-patient hospital care and community \nprimary care. Patients who can be seen in these clinics include those:507\n Recently discharged after an admission for decompensated HF (a waiting \n time of 7-12 days post discharge has to be the maximum wait-time).\n Who are in the early decompensation phase and need treatment modification.\n Who are stable but need uptitration of HF medications.\n With ICD or CRTs. \n With comorbidities, such as renal dysfunction, diabetes and COPD.\n With advanced HF who may benefit from:\n  Heart transplant\n  Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD)\n  Palliative care.\nThe objectives of these HF clinics may vary based on local settings. These include:\n507,508\n Optimisation of medical therapy particularly the uptitration of β-blockers, ACE-I  \n and MRA. \n Education of the patient and caregiver on the nature of the disease and its  \n progression. \n Promotion of self-care such as :\n  Compliance to medical therapy and fluid restriction.\n  Regular weighing and adjusting diuretic doses according to symptoms and  \n  body weight.\nPatient with optimised HF medications/treatment plans can be discharged to the \ncommunity with appropriate care plans to primary care. Close partnership between these HF clinics and primary care helps to reduce unnecessary admissions to hospital. \nIn 2018, the Heart Failure Medication Therapy Adherence Clinic (MTAC) was \nintroduced. These clinics are conducted by pharmacists in collaboration with doctors and other healthcare providers to improve HF management. The objectives of the Heart Failure MTAC are:\n509\n Enhance patient’s adherence to HF pharmacotherapy and non-pharmacological  \n interventions.\n To reduce unscheduled emergency department visits or hospitalisations of HF  \n patient due to acute decompensation.\n To provide consultative service to doctors on evidence-based HF pharmacotherapy  \n and related issues.\n To collaborate with doctors and other health care professionals in HF management  \n program.9.2 MONITORING AND FOLLOW-UP \nPatients with HF require regular follow-up and monitoring. Serial evaluations serve \nto assess a patient’s status, response to therapy, development of complications and disease progression. Key components of assessment include:\n Functional capacity - NYHA functional class or 6-minute walk test \n Fluid status and body weight \n Blood pressure, heart rate and rhythm \n Examination of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems\n Cognitive status and nutritional status \n Review of pharmacotherapy - uptitration, compliance and side effects\n Serum urea, electrolytes, creatinine and eGFR as necessary\n Diet and sodium intake\n Consumption of alcohol or illicit drugs\n Smoking history.\nThe frequency of follow-up will depend on the patient’s clinical stability and need for pharmacotherapy optimisation. A patient with a recent episode of decompensation or clinical instability, for instance, should ideally be seen again soon, usually within 2 weeks. Ultimately, the intensity and type of follow-up would be determined by the local organisation of care and resources.\nRoutine serial echocardiogram is not recommended. However, if there has been a \nrecent change in clinical status or if the patient has received treatment that might significantly change certain echocardiographic parameters, a follow-up echocardiogram is reasonable to assess the LVEF and structural remodeling.\nSerial brain natriuretic peptide measurements to guide and tailor HF therapy cannot \nbe broadly recommended at the present time due to a lack of consistent evidence.\n29-32 \n9.3 CARDIOLOGY REFERRAL \nHF patients with stable symptoms may be managed at the primary care level. \nReferral to the cardiologist should be considered in the following situations: \n De novo HF for a comprehensive workup to confirm the diagnosis and determine  \n the aetiology, and to devise a management plan.\n Episodes of acute decompensation.\n Worsening HF symptoms despite appropriate therapy. \n HF complicated with symptomatic hypotension or excessive bradycardia, limiting \n uptitration of pharmacotherapy. Symptomatic stable CAD and/or acute coronary syndrome for consideration of  \n revascularisation (PCI or CABG). \n Resuscitated cardiac arrest.\n Documented or suspected significant arrhythmias e.g. AF, VT.\n Significant valvular disease not previously assessed or worsening valvular  \n dysfunction.\n Pre-conception assessment and counselling of women with significant structural  \n heart disease and a past history of HF or LV dysfunction. \n Complex congenital cardiac lesions and/or Eisenmenger’s syndrome.\nDespite taking conventional HF therapy, patients may seek alternative therapy and healing approaches that are not considered as allopathic medicine. The National Centre for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) defines complementary \nand alternative medicine (CAM) as a group of diverse medical and healthcare interventions, practices, products or disciplines that are not generally considered part of conventional medicine.\n10.1 Enhanced External Counter Pulsation (EECP)\nThere is inadequate evidence of clinical effectiveness of EECP in HF.\n510-513 There is \nconcern that it could precipitate or exacerbate HF. \n10.2 Stem cell therapy\nA global position paper on cardiovascular regenerative medicine stated that \ncell-based therapy in HF patients is neither positive nor consistent.514 \n10.3 Omega 3 fatty acids\nIn patients with HFrEF, it may be considered as an adjunctive therapy based on a \nsingle randomised controlled trial (RCT) which showed a small benefit in CV death and/or hospitalisations.\n515,516 10.4 Coenzyme Q10\nThere is no convincing evidence to support or refute the use of coenzyme Q10 for \npatients with HF.517\n10.5 Tai Chi\nTai Chi may improve 6 min walk test distance, quality of life and LVEF in patients with \nHF.518,519 Its effect on hard CV outcomes such as rehospitalisation, MI and mortality \nis not known. \n10.6 YogaA meta-analysis in 2014 that includes two RCTs concluded that yoga improved peak \nVO2 (exercise capacity) and quality of life in chronic HF patients.\n520 There is an \nongoing RCT to look at the effect of yoga in HFpEF patients.521\nThe focus of future development for HF in Malaysia should be towards service \nenhancement working to meet the World Heart Federation mandate of a 25% reduction in premature non-communicable disease mortality by 2025. \nFinding the balance between costs and quality remains a global challenge, and the \nunderstanding of the disease in our healthcare context is imperative to making sure we move forward regarding service delivery, human resource allocation, medical expense costs and patient outcomes. To achieve this, the following need to be undertaken: \n Epidemiological studies to understand the disease profile in the country.\n Establishment and expansion of HFCs leading to more patient-centred HF care.\n Expanding service delivery, human resource allocation, medical expense cost  \n and patient outcomes.\n Education of healthcare personnel.\nEfforts should be directed to the knowledge and understanding of the epidemiology of HF in our country, its phenotype, presentation, current adherence to guideline-directed therapy and outcomes. Regular cluster sampling cohorts or a nationwide registry should be considered. Understanding the limitations of service delivery albeit geography or human resources and making plans for better service delivery systems \nare important.\nDevelopment of HFCs, can lead to a more patient-centric HF care. (See Section 9, Pages 110-113)\nModules for HF care need to be initiated in order to train and educate general \ninternal medicine physicians. A core-curriculum for education needs to be formed to ensure adequate training has been disseminated to HFC personnel.   \nIncentives regarding HF guidelines compliance should be implemented and HF \ninnovative practice should be encouraged with awards for best clinical practice and innovation be made available. \nThis streamline approach to HF care with engagement of connected groups hopefully \nwill help in better overall patient care and experience.\nPerformance measures should be used with the goal of improving quality of care for HF.\n518,519\nProcess performance measures focus on the aspects of care that are delivered to a patient, \nwhile outcome measures focus on the end-points such as mortality or hospitalisation.\nProcess performance indicators for in-patients with HF includes:522-524\n % of patients who had documentation of NYHA Functional Class.\n % of patients who had LVEF measurement.\n % of patients with current or prior LVEF < 40% and without contraindications  \n discharged with ACE-I/ARB. \n % of patients with current or prior LVEF < 40% and without contraindications  \n discharged on β-blockers.\n % of patients with current or prior LVEF < 40% and without contraindications  \n discharged on MRA.\n % of patients with chronic or paroxysmal AF/atrial flutter without contraindications  \n on anticoagulant therapy at discharge.\n % of patients given a post discharge appointment.\nThe accepted performance measure should be more than 60%.Outcome measures indicators include:\n In-hospital mortality\n 30-day readmission for HF\nRefer to Appendix VI, Page 121 for calculation of these measures."

Cardiomyopathy characterised by a decrease in Ejection Fraction (EF)  \n globally or due to regional changes in interventricular septum contraction. \n2. Symptoms of HF.3. Signs associated with HF including but not limited to S3 gallop, tachycardia,  \n or both.4. Decline in initial EF of at least 5% to < 55% with signs and symptoms of  \n HF or asymptomatic decrease in EF of at least 10% to < 55%.Chemotherapy drugs that have been associated with HF include (Appendix V, Page120):\n Doxorubicin \n  5% at a cumulative dose of 400mg/m2 (the higher the cumulative dose, \n  the greater the risk of HF.445  \n  Even at lower doses of 180 to 240mg/m2, subclinical events can  \n  occur in up to 30% of patients about 13 years post treatment.448\n  These suggest that there is no ‘safe’ dose for doxorubicin. \n Cyclophosphamide especially in high doses and ifosfomide.449,450  \n Newer agents such as monoclonal antibodies (trastuzumab and pertuzumab), \n small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (imatinib, sunitinib, sorafenib)  \n and the proteasome inhibitor (bortezomib).  Trastuzumab especially when administered together with anthracyclines \n  and cyclophosphamide, has been associated with an increased incidence \n  of HF of 27% compared to 1.7% to 4.1% when anthracycline was not part  \n  of the therapeutic regimen.\n451-453 Symptoms are usually mild to moderate \n  and improve following medical management and termination of drug  \n  administration. Improvement is usually seen in about 4-6 weeks after    withdrawal of the agent.\n454-456 After symptomatic improvement, \n  reinstitution  of treatment is usually possible.454-456\n  Vascular endothelial growth factor signaling pathway (VSP) inhibitors  \n  (bevacizumab) can cause hypertension. Bevacizumab also blocks  \n  receptors that are involved in the compensatory response to stress in  \n  the cardiomyocytes and when the heart is unable to compensate for  \n  the hypertension, it could lead to HF.457,458 Maintaining good blood pressure \n  control can prevent HF associated with this agent. Heart failure due to  \n  VSP inhibitors is usually reversible with cessation of the agent.459\nOne must consider both the efficacy and the toxicity in choosing chemotherapeutic agents. Many of the newer targeted agents cause a reversible form of HF and symptoms usually resolve after the initiation of anti-failure medications.\n454-456,459,460 \nRisk factors for anthracycline toxicity include: 461-465\n The total cumulative dose\n Intravenous bolus administration versus infusion\n Higher single doses\n History of prior irradiation\n Use of concomitant agents known to have cardiotoxicity\n Female gender\n Underlying CV disease\n Age (young and elderly)\n An increase in cardiac biomarkers such as troponins during and   after administration is an indication of toxicity.8.5.5.1 Management\n Patients undergoing chemotherapy should have a careful clinical evaluation \n and assessment and treatment of CV risk factors.464,465\n Blood pressure control is important in all patients especially in those  \n being considered for VSP inhibitors.\n All patients with potential cardiotoxic chemotherapy should have an  \n echocardiogram prior to treatment. An important parameter is the LVEF  \n determined using the biplane method of discs (Simpson’s method) or  \n three-dimensional echocardiography where available. Newer techniques   to detect and quantitate regional and global myocardial dysfunction  \n (strain assessment with global longitudinal strain) can be used to detect  \n pre-clinical and subtle changes in function.\n466-469 \n Biomarkers such as troponin and natriuretic peptides can help identify  \n patients at higher risk.462,463,470,471 \nClose collaboration between the oncologist and the cardiologist is important. \nFor the oncologists, the strategy (prior to commencement) includes:465\n Identifying high risk patients (pre-existing heart disease, presence of  \n CV risk factors, age - young and old, female gender, use of high dose  \n anthracycline regimens).\n High risk patients should:\n  Have a pre-treatment cardiac function evaluation. If the LVEF is < 50%,  \n  refer to the cardiologist.  Be considered for non-cardiotoxic alternatives. \n  Have their therapy protocols adjusted where necessary (e.g. reduction \n  in doses, continuous infusions rather than bolus injections, liposomal    doxorubicin, dexrazoxane etc). \nFor the cardiologists/general physicians, the strategy includes:\n Treating CV risk factors. \n Assessing, repeating (if necessary) imaging studies. (e.g. using high  \n quality LVEF measurement, strain evaluation etc).\n Assessing cardiac biomarkers (troponin and/or NP).\n Considering cardio-protection prior to/or during treatment using β-blockers,  \n MRA and/or ACE-I/ARB if:69,465,472-474\n  EF < 50%, \n  EF drops by > 10%\n  Abnormal global longitudinal strain (GLS) (> 15% drop).  Monitoring LVEF during therapy is important with repeat echocardiography  \n at 3-monthly intervals and/or according to symptoms. If cardioprotective  \n medications are given, monitoring may be necessary at closer intervals of  \n time depending on the clinical condition of the patient e.g. 1-monthly interval. \n Withholding cardiotoxic therapy only as a last resort. (for anthracycline  \n LVEF < 45%, for anti-HER2 therapy LVEF < 40%).\n Monitoring even after completion of therapy:\n  Obtain post therapy LVEF.\n  Repeat echocardiography in 6 months or 1 year. Most cases of  \n  treatment-associated cardiac dysfunction develop within the first year  \n  after completion of therapy.475,476 \n  If EF remains abnormal, follow guidelines for management of HF.465 \n \n8.5.6 HEART FAILURE AND KIDNEY DYSFUNCTION\n8.5.6.1 Epidemiology, definitions and classifications Cardiac and pre-existing kidney disease at admission frequently co-exist, \nvarying from 45.4% in patients with chronic HF to > 60% in those with AHF.\n477,478 \nIn addition, during treatment of AHF, a significant proportion of patients will develop varying degrees of worsening renal function (WRF).\nThe definition of WRF is:\n479\n An increase in serum creatinine by ≥ 26.5μmol/ L (0.3mg/dl) and/or\n A ≥ 25% increase in serum creatinine or a ≥ 20% drop in eGFR.\nThe rise in serum creatinine usually occurs in the first three to five days of \nhospitalisation. The incidence of WRF is estimated to be between 19 and 45%.165 This large \nobserved range is due to variations in the definitions of WRF, the observed time-at-risk and the study population.\n165 \nRisk factors for WRF during admission for HF include:480\n A prior history of HF or diabetes, \n An admission serum creatinine of > 133μmol/L,  or \n Systolic blood pressure > 160mmHg. \nWRF may fulfill criteria for type 1 or type 2 cardiorenal syndrome (CRS). The term “cardiorenal syndrome” refers to disorders of the heart and kidneys whereby acute or chronic dysfunction in one organ may induce acute or chronic dysfunction of the other.\n165 \nThis syndrome has been classified by the Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative working group into 5 subtypes as shown in Table 17, Page 105.\n165 Many \npatients however, may belong to more than one subtype and may move between subtypes during the course of their disease.\n165\n8.5.6.2. Pathogenesis of CRS \nMultiple mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of CRS. These include:\n Increased renal venous pressure  - venous congestion is probably the  \n most important factor.481 \n RV dysfunction.\n Reduced renal perfusion with reduced cardiac output. \n Neurohumoral adaptations (e.g. activation of the sympathetic nervous  \n system and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, increases in  \n vasopressin and endothelin-1).8.5.6.3  Clinical significance /Impact of kidney dysfunction in HF  The combination of cardiac and kidney disease increases the complexity and \ncosts of care, and may interact to worsen prognosis. \nA. Pharmacologic considerations \n Safety:\n  Dosing of renally-excreted cardiac drugs need adjustment in the  \n  presence of renal impairment (e.g. digoxin, insulin, low molecular  \n  weight heparin).\n  Patients with HF are at increased risk of contrast-induced acute kidney \n  injury. \n Efficacy:\n  Impaired renal function will affect drug choices and dosing. If eGFR <  \n  30mls/min/1.73m2, most thiazide diuretics are no longer effective and  \n  loop diuretics are preferred. Higher doses of loop diuretics may be   \n  required with increasing renal impairment.             B. Prognostic implications\n Preexisting CKD is a bad prognostic indicator in patients with HF - the  \n more severe the CKD, the worse the mortality.482,483\n In patients with HF, WRF may not always indicate a poor outcome.484 The  \n prognostic value of WRF is mainly determined by:   The presence of persistent congestion  \n  Baseline renal function and magnitude of renal changes \n  Duration - persistent WRF is usually associated with hemodynamic  \n  derangements and poor prognosis as compared with transient WRF  \n  as a result of agressive decongestive therapy.485-487\nTable 17: Classification of Cardiorenal Syndrome (CRS)8.5.6.4. Management \n A multi-disciplinary approach is recommended. Early referral to a  \n nephrologist is advisable.   \n Exclude potentially reversible causes for increasing renal dysfunction  \n such as hyper - or hypovolaemia, concomitant medications such as  \n aminoglycosides and NSAIDs, ACE-I or ARB and renal artery stenosis. \n Closely monitor electrolytes and kidney function, especially during acute  \n illnesses, dehydration and when increasing doses of cardiac drugs  \n including diuretics. The baseline renal function will determine how frequently \n this should be done. \n The recommended range for serum potassium is 4-5.5mmol/L.488 \n Wherever possible, avoid nephrotoxins, e.g. contrast media for angiography\n Intravenous diuretics \n  Loop diuretics are the first choice.\n  Continuous infusion may not have greater benefits compared with  \n  bolus dosing.115-118,489\n  Start initially with 2-2.5 times the usual oral dose. \n  Combination therapy (loop diuretic and thiazide/thiazide-like diuretic/\n  mineralocorticoid) may be required to enhance diuresis.205-207 However,  \n  care is required to avoid electrolyte disturbances, hypovolaemia and  \n  worsening renal dysfunction. \n Careful use of Renin Angiotensin System (RAS) blockers  \n  HF patients with stable, chronic mild-moderate renal insufficiency  \n  (eGFR > 30mls/min/1.73m2) should receive standard therapy with an  \n  ACE-I/ ARB and an MRA.490\n  A serum creatinine rise or GFR decrease by up to 30% from baseline  \n  may be acceptable before it becomes necessary to consider stopping  \n  or decreasing doses.221 \n  In patients with advanced renal failure, the decision to start or stop  \n  RAS blockers should be individualised.490\n  Consider withholding RAS blockers during aggressive diuresis in  \n  patients at high risk for WRF.\n  RAS blockers (and β-blockers) can be used in patients with HF who  \n  are on chronic dialysis therapy.\n Ultrafiltration \n  This involves the removal of plasma water across a semi-permeable  \n  membrane in response to a transmembrane pressure gradient.   It may be considered for congestive symptoms refractory to diuresis,  \n  but should be used in consultation with a nephrologist.\n491\n  Evidence for its efficacy in fluid removal is mixed at present.491  Haemodialysis \n  Criteria for possible need to initiate renal replacement therapy include:\n   Oliguria unresponsive to fluid resuscitation.\n   Severe hyperkalaemia (serum potassium > 6.5mmol/L).\n   Severe acidaemia (pH < 7.2). \n   Serum urea > 25mmol/L. \n    Serum creatinine > 300μmol/L. \n8.6  ADVANCED HEART FAILURE/REFRACTORY HEART FAILURE\nThese are patients with severe symptoms of HF despite maximal medical \ntherapy. Hospital admission is necessary for stabilisation. Meticulous control of fluid balance is important. Aggravating causes of HF as listed in Table 5, Page 39 should be identified and treated.\nThese patients may need specialised treatment in CCU or ICU. The following \nmay be required:\n Intravenous infusion of frusemide. These patients may require combination  \n loop diuretics and thiazides.\n Intravenous infusion of inotropes - low dose dobutamine (5mcg/kg/min) or  \n milrinone. These improve symptoms but no survival benefit has been  \n demonstrated.126,492\n Ultrafiltration in patients who are fluid overloaded.493 In most patients,  \n however, the relief is temporary.\nThe prognosis of these patients is poor. They should be referred to assess \nwhether they may be potential candidates for mechanical circulatory support (e.g. LVAD) and consideration for heart transplant.\n8.6.1 HEART TRANSPLANTHeart transplantation is a well-established treatment of refractory end stage \nHF. This definitive therapy for HF however is limited by the lack of donor organs.\n494,495I,CI,CI,AIIa,BIIa,BI,BI,CI,CI,CI,C\nIIa,BAll patients with severe symptomatic HF despite optimal medical therapy and no other alternative therapy option should be considered for heart transplant. They need to be referred to a HF specialist cardiac hospital for further evaluation.\nAssessment for heart transplant is done by a multispeciality, multidisciplinary \nteam and appropriate work up will be performed for eligibility.\nEligibility criteria to be considered for heart transplant include:\n Poor LVEF (< 25%).\n Recurrent HF hospitalisations.\n Major limitation of the patient’s daily activities.\n Poor effort tolerance i.e. peak VO2 (maximal oxygen consumption or  \n peak oxygen uptake) less than 10ml/kg/min (or < 50% predicted). VO2  \n max is the maximum rate of oxygen consumption measured during  \n incremental exercise ie exercise of increasing intensity and is widely  \n used as an indicator of cardiorespiratory fitness.\n Intravenous inotropic dependence for symptomatic relief or to maintain  \n end organ function.\n Motivated, psychologically stable and compliant to therapy.\nContraindications to heart transplant\n Active infection.\n Severe peripheral arterial or cerebrovascular disease.\n Malignancy within 5 years.\n Diabetes mellitus with widespread microvascular complications.\n Systemic disease with multi-organ dysfunction.\n Irreversible chronic kidney, liver or lung disease.\n Pharmacologically irreversible pulmonary hypertension.\n Other medical or psychosocial issues that would impact survival.\n8.6.2 MECHANICAL CIRCULATORY SUPPORT The use of mechanical circulatory support (e.g. LVAD), should be considered \nfor patients with potentially reversible or treatable conditions or as a bridge to heart transplant in suitable candidates.\nLVAD may also be used as destination therapy in candidates who are not \nsuitable for transplant. Patients have improvement in their symptoms when compared to optimal medical therapy.\n496,497 However, the rate of rehospitalisations \ndue to complications of bleeding, thrombosis and infections are high.496-498 \nMany patients also go into major depression. Thus, extensive discussion with the patient and family is necessary prior to LVAD implantation.8.7 PALLIATIVE AND END OF LIFE CARE\nDespite recent advances in therapy, for some patients, HF remains a \nprogressive disease and carries a poor prognosis. Patients with refractory symptoms despite guideline-directed medical therapy, should be considered for palliative and end of life care if they have the following characteristics:\n499\n Progressive functional decline (mental and physical) and dependence in  \n most activities of daily living.\n Severe HF symptoms with poor quality of life despite optimal pharmacological \n and non-pharmacological therapies.\n Frequent hospital admissions or serious episodes of decompensation  \n despite optimal therapies.\n Heart transplantation and mechanical circulatory support ruled out.\n Cardiac cachexia.\n Clinically judged to be near end of life.\nThe aim of palliative care in HF is to prevent and relieve suffering and to promote the best quality of life for patients and their families.\n500\nDespite the complexities of end-of-life issues in HF patients, there is minimal evidence-based guidance on the care of this population.\n501 The key components \nof end-of-life care are:\n 1. Advanced care plan with directives and informed decisions on:\n   Use or withdrawal of treatment including advanced therapies such  \n   as V inotropes, ICD and mechanical circulatory support. \n   When it would be appropriate to switch off devices such as ICD or  \n   CRT. \n   Resuscitation status.\n   Preferred location of death (i.e. at home or hospital).\n 2. Symptom management \n  Goals of care at this stage should shift from extending life to controlling \n  symptoms and maximising quality of life. Common symptoms include:\n   Dyspnoea\n   Fatigue\n   Pain\n   Urinary retention \n  Constipation\n  Cachexia\n  Depression\n Medications that may be useful include analgesics, antiemetics, anxiolytics,  \n opioids, laxatives, and diuretics, etc. \n3. Psychosocial support\n The impact of HF on quality of life for the patient and family is complex and  \n extends beyond physical symptoms.502\n Emotional, spiritual and social support should be provided to alleviate patient  \n anxiety about dying, and to guide patient towards a peaceful journey at the end  \n of life.\n9.1 LEVEL OF CARE AND SHARED MANAGEMENT \nThe care of patients with HF should ideally take place in a multidisciplinary system, \nallowing for shared care between the hospital (secondary or tertiary settings) and \ncommunity (primary setting). A multidisciplinary approach encompasses patient \neducation, cardiac rehabilitation, psychosocial support and palliative care, and has been proven to reduce HF hospitalisations and mortality in discharged patients.\n503-505\nThe multidisciplinary team usually consists of cardiologists and or general physicians, HF nurses, pharmacists, dieticians, physiotherapists, primary care \nproviders, social workers as well as geriatricians, psychologists, occupational \ntherapists and when necessary, palliative care specialists. Care can be done in two different settings: \n In the patient’s own home - home-based interventions are associated with  \n significantly lower healthcare costs, reduced hospital readmissions and an  \n improvement in the patient’s quality of life.506 This may however, not be feasible  \n in our local setting.\n Specialist outpatient clinic - the Heart Failure Clinic (HFC). \nHFCs can either be:\n Nurse-directed - these are run by nurses with special training in HF.\n Physician-directed - run by general physicians and/or cardiologists. \nHFCs can be established in the tertiary hospitals or in the primary care setting. The minimum human resource requirements are a:\n Cardiologist or general physician with an interest in cardiology and HF, \n Dedicated nurse and \n Medical technologist for blood taking, doing echocardiography and 6 minutes \n walk tests.In bigger clinic settings, the involvement of physiotherapists to encourage physical \nactivity, pharmacists and counsellors for end of life care would be advisable.\nThese clinics will be the intermediary between in-patient hospital care and community \nprimary care. Patients who can be seen in these clinics include those:507\n Recently discharged after an admission for decompensated HF (a waiting \n time of 7-12 days post discharge has to be the maximum wait-time).\n Who are in the early decompensation phase and need treatment modification.\n Who are stable but need uptitration of HF medications.\n With ICD or CRTs. \n With comorbidities, such as renal dysfunction, diabetes and COPD.\n With advanced HF who may benefit from:\n  Heart transplant\n  Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD)\n  Palliative care.\nThe objectives of these HF clinics may vary based on local settings. These include:\n507,508\n Optimisation of medical therapy particularly the uptitration of β-blockers, ACE-I  \n and MRA. \n Education of the patient and caregiver on the nature of the disease and its  \n progression. \n Promotion of self-care such as :\n  Compliance to medical therapy and fluid restriction.\n  Regular weighing and adjusting diuretic doses according to symptoms and  \n  body weight.\nPatient with optimised HF medications/treatment plans can be discharged to the \ncommunity with appropriate care plans to primary care. Close partnership between these HF clinics and primary care helps to reduce unnecessary admissions to hospital. \nIn 2018, the Heart Failure Medication Therapy Adherence Clinic (MTAC) was \nintroduced. These clinics are conducted by pharmacists in collaboration with doctors and other healthcare providers to improve HF management. The objectives of the Heart Failure MTAC are:\n509\n Enhance patient’s adherence to HF pharmacotherapy and non-pharmacological  \n interventions.\n To reduce unscheduled emergency department visits or hospitalisations of HF  \n patient due to acute decompensation.\n To provide consultative service to doctors on evidence-based HF pharmacotherapy  \n and related issues.\n To collaborate with doctors and other health care professionals in HF management  \n program.9.2 MONITORING AND FOLLOW-UP \nPatients with HF require regular follow-up and monitoring. Serial evaluations serve \nto assess a patient’s status, response to therapy, development of complications and disease progression. Key components of assessment include:\n Functional capacity - NYHA functional class or 6-minute walk test \n Fluid status and body weight \n Blood pressure, heart rate and rhythm \n Examination of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems\n Cognitive status and nutritional status \n Review of pharmacotherapy - uptitration, compliance and side effects\n Serum urea, electrolytes, creatinine and eGFR as necessary\n Diet and sodium intake\n Consumption of alcohol or illicit drugs\n Smoking history.\nThe frequency of follow-up will depend on the patient’s clinical stability and need for pharmacotherapy optimisation. A patient with a recent episode of decompensation or clinical instability, for instance, should ideally be seen again soon, usually within 2 weeks. Ultimately, the intensity and type of follow-up would be determined by the local organisation of care and resources.\nRoutine serial echocardiogram is not recommended. However, if there has been a \nrecent change in clinical status or if the patient has received treatment that might significantly change certain echocardiographic parameters, a follow-up echocardiogram is reasonable to assess the LVEF and structural remodeling.\nSerial brain natriuretic peptide measurements to guide and tailor HF therapy cannot \nbe broadly recommended at the present time due to a lack of consistent evidence.\n29-32 \n9.3 CARDIOLOGY REFERRAL \nHF patients with stable symptoms may be managed at the primary care level. \nReferral to the cardiologist should be considered in the following situations: \n De novo HF for a comprehensive workup to confirm the diagnosis and determine  \n the aetiology, and to devise a management plan.\n Episodes of acute decompensation.\n Worsening HF symptoms despite appropriate therapy. \n HF complicated with symptomatic hypotension or excessive bradycardia, limiting \n uptitration of pharmacotherapy. Symptomatic stable CAD and/or acute coronary syndrome for consideration of  \n revascularisation (PCI or CABG). \n Resuscitated cardiac arrest.\n Documented or suspected significant arrhythmias e.g. AF, VT.\n Significant valvular disease not previously assessed or worsening valvular  \n dysfunction.\n Pre-conception assessment and counselling of women with significant structural  \n heart disease and a past history of HF or LV dysfunction. \n Complex congenital cardiac lesions and/or Eisenmenger’s syndrome.\nDespite taking conventional HF therapy, patients may seek alternative therapy and healing approaches that are not considered as allopathic medicine. The National Centre for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) defines complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) as a group of diverse medical and healthcare interventions, practices, products or disciplines that are not generally considered part of conventional medicine.\n10.1 Enhanced External Counter Pulsation (EECP)\nThere is inadequate evidence of clinical effectiveness of EECP in HF.\n510-513 There is \nconcern that it could precipitate or exacerbate HF. \n10.2 Stem cell therapy\nA global position paper on cardiovascular regenerative medicine stated that \ncell-based therapy in HF patients is neither positive nor consistent.514 \n10.3 Omega 3 fatty acids\nIn patients with HFrEF, it may be considered as an adjunctive therapy based on a \nsingle randomised controlled trial (RCT) which showed a small benefit in CV death and/or hospitalisations.\n515,516 10.4 Coenzyme Q10\nThere is no convincing evidence to support or refute the use of coenzyme Q10 for \npatients with HF.517\n10.5 Tai Chi\nTai Chi may improve 6 min walk test distance, quality of life and LVEF in patients with \nHF.518,519 Its effect on hard CV outcomes such as rehospitalisation, MI and mortality \nis not known. \n10.6 YogaA meta-analysis in 2014 that includes two RCTs concluded that yoga improved peak \nVO2 (exercise capacity) and quality of life in chronic HF patients.\n520 There is an \nongoing RCT to look at the effect of yoga in HFpEF patients.521\nThe focus of future development for HF in Malaysia should be towards service \nenhancement working to meet the World Heart Federation mandate of a 25% reduction in premature non-communicable disease mortality by 2025. \nFinding the balance between costs and quality remains a global challenge, and the \nunderstanding of the disease in our healthcare context is imperative to making sure we move forward regarding service delivery, human resource allocation, medical expense costs and patient outcomes. To achieve this, the following need to be undertaken: \n Epidemiological studies to understand the disease profile in the country.\n Establishment and expansion of HFCs leading to more patient-centred HF care.\n Expanding service delivery, human resource allocation, medical expense cost  \n and patient outcomes.\n Education of healthcare personnel.\nEfforts should be directed to the knowledge and understanding of the epidemiology of HF in our country, its phenotype, presentation, current adherence to guideline-directed therapy and outcomes. Regular cluster sampling cohorts or a nationwide registry should be considered. Understanding the limitations of service delivery albeit geography or human resources and making plans for better service delivery systems \nare important.\nDevelopment of HFCs, can lead to a more patient-centric HF care. (See Section 9, Pages 110-113)\nModules for HF care need to be initiated in order to train and educate general \ninternal medicine physicians. A core-curriculum for education needs to be formed to ensure adequate training has been disseminated to HFC personnel.   \nIncentives regarding HF guidelines compliance should be implemented and HF \ninnovative practice should be encouraged with awards for best clinical practice and innovation be made available. \nThis streamline approach to HF care with engagement of connected groups hopefully \nwill help in better overall patient care and experience.\nPerformance measures should be used with the goal of improving quality of care for HF.\n518,519\nProcess performance measures focus on the aspects of care that are delivered to a patient, \nwhile outcome measures focus on the end-points such as mortality or hospitalisation.\nProcess performance indicators for in-patients with HF includes:522-524\n % of patients who had documentation of NYHA Functional Class.\n % of patients who had LVEF measurement.\n % of patients with current or prior LVEF < 40% and without contraindications  \n discharged with ACE-I/ARB. \n % of patients with current or prior LVEF < 40% and without contraindications  \n discharged on β-blockers.\n % of patients with current or prior LVEF < 40% and without contraindications  \n discharged on MRA.\n % of patients with chronic or paroxysmal AF/atrial flutter without contraindications  \n on anticoagulant therapy at discharge.\n % of patients given a post discharge appointment.\nThe accepted performance measure should be more than 60%.Outcome measures indicators include:\n In-hospital mortality\n 30-day readmission for HF\nRefer to Appendix VI, Page 121 for calculation of these measures."

Cardiomyopathy characterised by a decrease in Ejection Fraction (EF)  \n globally or due to regional changes in interventricular septum contraction. \n2. Symptoms of HF.3. Signs associated with HF including but not limited to S3 gallop, tachycardia,  \n or both.4. Decline in initial EF of at least 5% to < 55% with signs and symptoms of  \n HF or asymptomatic decrease in EF of at least 10% to < 55%.Chemotherapy drugs that have been associated with HF include (Appendix V, Page120):\n Doxorubicin \n  5% at a cumulative dose of 400mg/m2 (the higher the cumulative dose, \n  the greater the risk of HF.445  \n  Even at lower doses of 180 to 240mg/m2, subclinical events can  \n  occur in up to 30% of patients about 13 years post treatment.448\n  These suggest that there is no ‘safe’ dose for doxorubicin. \n Cyclophosphamide especially in high doses and ifosfomide.449,450  \n Newer agents such as monoclonal antibodies (trastuzumab and pertuzumab), \n small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (imatinib, sunitinib, sorafenib)  \n and the proteasome inhibitor (bortezomib).  Trastuzumab especially when administered together with anthracyclines \n  and cyclophosphamide, has been associated with an increased incidence \n  of HF of 27% compared to 1.7% to 4.1% when anthracycline was not part  \n  of the therapeutic regimen.\n451-453 Symptoms are usually mild to moderate \n  and improve following medical management and termination of drug  \n  administration. Improvement is usually seen in about 4-6 weeks after    withdrawal of the agent.\n454-456 After symptomatic improvement, \n  reinstitution  of treatment is usually possible.454-456\n  Vascular endothelial growth factor signaling pathway (VSP) inhibitors  \n  (bevacizumab) can cause hypertension. Bevacizumab also blocks  \n  receptors that are involved in the compensatory response to stress in  \n  the cardiomyocytes and when the heart is unable to compensate for  \n  the hypertension, it could lead to HF.457,458 Maintaining good blood pressure \n  control can prevent HF associated with this agent. Heart failure due to  \n  VSP inhibitors is usually reversible with cessation of the agent.459\nOne must consider both the efficacy and the toxicity in choosing chemotherapeutic agents. Many of the newer targeted agents cause a reversible form of HF and symptoms usually resolve after the initiation of anti-failure medications.\n454-456,459,460 \nRisk factors for anthracycline toxicity include: 461-465\n The total cumulative dose\n Intravenous bolus administration versus infusion\n Higher single doses\n History of prior irradiation\n Use of concomitant agents known to have cardiotoxicity\n Female gender\n Underlying CV disease\n Age (young and elderly)\n An increase in cardiac biomarkers such as troponins during and   after administration is an indication of toxicity.8.5.5.1 Management\n Patients undergoing chemotherapy should have a careful clinical evaluation \n and assessment and treatment of CV risk factors.464,465\n Blood pressure control is important in all patients especially in those  \n being considered for VSP inhibitors.\n All patients with potential cardiotoxic chemotherapy should have an  \n echocardiogram prior to treatment. An important parameter is the LVEF  \n determined using the biplane method of discs (Simpson’s method) or  \n three-dimensional echocardiography where available. Newer techniques   to detect and quantitate regional and global myocardial dysfunction  \n (strain assessment with global longitudinal strain) can be used to detect  \n pre-clinical and subtle changes in function.\n466-469 \n Biomarkers such as troponin and natriuretic peptides can help identify  \n patients at higher risk.462,463,470,471 \nClose collaboration between the oncologist and the cardiologist is important. \nFor the oncologists, the strategy (prior to commencement) includes:465\n Identifying high risk patients (pre-existing heart disease, presence of  \n CV risk factors, age - young and old, female gender, use of high dose  \n anthracycline regimens).\n High risk patients should:\n  Have a pre-treatment cardiac function evaluation. If the LVEF is < 50%,  \n  refer to the cardiologist.  Be considered for non-cardiotoxic alternatives. \n  Have their therapy protocols adjusted where necessary (e.g. reduction \n  in doses, continuous infusions rather than bolus injections, liposomal    doxorubicin, dexrazoxane etc). \nFor the cardiologists/general physicians, the strategy includes:\n Treating CV risk factors. \n Assessing, repeating (if necessary) imaging studies. (e.g. using high  \n quality LVEF measurement, strain evaluation etc).\n Assessing cardiac biomarkers (troponin and/or NP).\n Considering cardio-protection prior to/or during treatment using β-blockers,  \n MRA and/or ACE-I/ARB if:69,465,472-474\n  EF < 50%, \n  EF drops by > 10%\n  Abnormal global longitudinal strain (GLS) (> 15% drop).  Monitoring LVEF during therapy is important with repeat echocardiography  \n at 3-monthly intervals and/or according to symptoms. If cardioprotective  \n medications are given, monitoring may be necessary at closer intervals of  \n time depending on the clinical condition of the patient e.g. 1-monthly interval. \n Withholding cardiotoxic therapy only as a last resort. (for anthracycline  \n LVEF < 45%, for anti-HER2 therapy LVEF < 40%).\n Monitoring even after completion of therapy:\n  Obtain post therapy LVEF.\n  Repeat echocardiography in 6 months or 1 year. Most cases of  \n  treatment-associated cardiac dysfunction develop within the first year  \n  after completion of therapy.475,476 \n  If EF remains abnormal, follow guidelines for management of HF.465 \n \n8.5.6 HEART FAILURE AND KIDNEY DYSFUNCTION\n8.5.6.1 Epidemiology, definitions and classifications Cardiac and pre-existing kidney disease at admission frequently co-exist, \nvarying from 45.4% in patients with chronic HF to > 60% in those with AHF.\n477,478 \nIn addition, during treatment of AHF, a significant proportion of patients will develop varying degrees of worsening renal function (WRF).\nThe definition of WRF is:\n479\n An increase in serum creatinine by ≥ 26.5μmol/ L (0.3mg/dl) and/or\n A ≥ 25% increase in serum creatinine or a ≥ 20% drop in eGFR.\nThe rise in serum creatinine usually occurs in the first three to five days of \nhospitalisation. The incidence of WRF is estimated to be between 19 and 45%.165 This large \nobserved range is due to variations in the definitions of WRF, the observed time-at-risk and the study population.\n165 \nRisk factors for WRF during admission for HF include:480\n A prior history of HF or diabetes, \n An admission serum creatinine of > 133μmol/L,  or \n Systolic blood pressure > 160mmHg. \nWRF may fulfill criteria for type 1 or type 2 cardiorenal syndrome (CRS). The term “cardiorenal syndrome” refers to disorders of the heart and kidneys whereby acute or chronic dysfunction in one organ may induce acute or chronic dysfunction of the other.\n165 \nThis syndrome has been classified by the Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative working group into 5 subtypes as shown in Table 17, Page 105.\n165 Many \npatients however, may belong to more than one subtype and may move between subtypes during the course of their disease.\n165\n8.5.6.2. Pathogenesis of CRS \nMultiple mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of CRS. These include:\n Increased renal venous pressure  - venous congestion is probably the  \n most important factor.481 \n RV dysfunction.\n Reduced renal perfusion with reduced cardiac output. \n Neurohumoral adaptations (e.g. activation of the sympathetic nervous  \n system and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, increases in  \n vasopressin and endothelin-1).8.5.6.3  Clinical significance /Impact of kidney dysfunction in HF  The combination of cardiac and kidney disease increases the complexity and \ncosts of care, and may interact to worsen prognosis. \nA. Pharmacologic considerations \n Safety:\n  Dosing of renally-excreted cardiac drugs need adjustment in the  \n  presence of renal impairment (e.g. digoxin, insulin, low molecular  \n  weight heparin).\n  Patients with HF are at increased risk of contrast-induced acute kidney \n  injury. \n Efficacy:\n  Impaired renal function will affect drug choices and dosing. If eGFR <  \n  30mls/min/1.73m2, most thiazide diuretics are no longer effective and  \n  loop diuretics are preferred. Higher doses of loop diuretics may be   \n  required with increasing renal impairment.             B. Prognostic implications\n Preexisting CKD is a bad prognostic indicator in patients with HF - the  \n more severe the CKD, the worse the mortality.482,483\n In patients with HF, WRF may not always indicate a poor outcome.484 The  \n prognostic value of WRF is mainly determined by:   The presence of persistent congestion  \n  Baseline renal function and magnitude of renal changes \n  Duration - persistent WRF is usually associated with hemodynamic  \n  derangements and poor prognosis as compared with transient WRF  \n  as a result of agressive decongestive therapy.485-487\nTable 17: Classification of Cardiorenal Syndrome (CRS)8.5.6.4. Management \n A multi-disciplinary approach is recommended. Early referral to a  \n nephrologist is advisable.   \n Exclude potentially reversible causes for increasing renal dysfunction  \n such as hyper - or hypovolaemia, concomitant medications such as  \n aminoglycosides and NSAIDs, ACE-I or ARB and renal artery stenosis. \n Closely monitor electrolytes and kidney function, especially during acute  \n illnesses, dehydration and when increasing doses of cardiac drugs  \n including diuretics. The baseline renal function will determine how frequently \n this should be done. \n The recommended range for serum potassium is 4-5.5mmol/L.488 \n Wherever possible, avoid nephrotoxins, e.g. contrast media for angiography\n Intravenous diuretics \n  Loop diuretics are the first choice.\n  Continuous infusion may not have greater benefits compared with  \n  bolus dosing.115-118,489\n  Start initially with 2-2.5 times the usual oral dose. \n  Combination therapy (loop diuretic and thiazide/thiazide-like diuretic/\n  mineralocorticoid) may be required to enhance diuresis.205-207 However,  \n  care is required to avoid electrolyte disturbances, hypovolaemia and  \n  worsening renal dysfunction. \n Careful use of Renin Angiotensin System (RAS) blockers  \n  HF patients with stable, chronic mild-moderate renal insufficiency  \n  (eGFR > 30mls/min/1.73m2) should receive standard therapy with an  \n  ACE-I/ ARB and an MRA.490\n  A serum creatinine rise or GFR decrease by up to 30% from baseline  \n  may be acceptable before it becomes necessary to consider stopping  \n  or decreasing doses.221 \n  In patients with advanced renal failure, the decision to start or stop  \n  RAS blockers should be individualised.490\n  Consider withholding RAS blockers during aggressive diuresis in  \n  patients at high risk for WRF.  RAS blockers (and β-blockers) can be used in patients with HF who  \n  are on chronic dialysis therapy.\n Ultrafiltration \n  This involves the removal of plasma water across a semi-permeable  \n  membrane in response to a transmembrane pressure gradient.   It may be considered for congestive symptoms refractory to diuresis,  \n  but should be used in consultation with a nephrologist.\n491\n  Evidence for its efficacy in fluid removal is mixed at present.491  Haemodialysis \n  Criteria for possible need to initiate renal replacement therapy include:\n   Oliguria unresponsive to fluid resuscitation.\n   Severe hyperkalaemia (serum potassium > 6.5mmol/L).\n   Severe acidaemia (pH < 7.2). \n   Serum urea > 25mmol/L. \n    Serum creatinine > 300μmol/L. \n8.6  ADVANCED HEART FAILURE/REFRACTORY HEART FAILURE\nThese are patients with severe symptoms of HF despite maximal medical \ntherapy. Hospital admission is necessary for stabilisation. Meticulous control of fluid balance is important. Aggravating causes of HF as listed in Table 5, Page 39 should be identified and treated.\nThese patients may need specialised treatment in CCU or ICU. The following \nmay be required:\n Intravenous infusion of frusemide. These patients may require combination  \n loop diuretics and thiazides.\n Intravenous infusion of inotropes - low dose dobutamine (5mcg/kg/min) or  \n milrinone. These improve symptoms but no survival benefit has been  \n demonstrated.126,492\n Ultrafiltration in patients who are fluid overloaded.493 In most patients,  \n however, the relief is temporary.\nThe prognosis of these patients is poor. They should be referred to assess \nwhether they may be potential candidates for mechanical circulatory support (e.g. LVAD) and consideration for heart transplant.\n8.6.1 HEART TRANSPLANTHeart transplantation is a well-established treatment of refractory end stage \nHF. This definitive therapy for HF however is limited by the lack of donor organs.\n494,495\nKey message 9:\n Cardiac and kidney disease frequently co-exist and this increases  \n the complexity and costs of care, and may interact to worsen prognosis.\n Management includes the use of intravenous diuretics, careful use  \n of Renin Angiotensin System blockers, β-blockers and occasionally  \n ultrafiltration and haemodialysis.All patients with severe symptomatic HF despite optimal medical therapy and no other alternative therapy option should be considered for heart transplant. They need to be referred to a HF specialist cardiac hospital for further evaluation.\nAssessment for heart transplant is done by a multispeciality, multidisciplinary \nteam and appropriate work up will be performed for eligibility.\nEligibility criteria to be considered for heart transplant include:\n Poor LVEF (< 25%).\n Recurrent HF hospitalisations.\n Major limitation of the patient’s daily activities.\n Poor effort tolerance i.e. peak VO2 (maximal oxygen consumption or  \n peak oxygen uptake) less than 10ml/kg/min (or < 50% predicted). VO2  \n max is the maximum rate of oxygen consumption measured during  \n incremental exercise ie exercise of increasing intensity and is widely  \n used as an indicator of cardiorespiratory fitness.\n Intravenous inotropic dependence for symptomatic relief or to maintain  \n end organ function.\n Motivated, psychologically stable and compliant to therapy.\nContraindications to heart transplant\n Active infection.\n Severe peripheral arterial or cerebrovascular disease.\n Malignancy within 5 years.\n Diabetes mellitus with widespread microvascular complications.\n Systemic disease with multi-organ dysfunction.\n Irreversible chronic kidney, liver or lung disease.\n Pharmacologically irreversible pulmonary hypertension.\n Other medical or psychosocial issues that would impact survival.\n8.6.2 MECHANICAL CIRCULATORY SUPPORT The use of mechanical circulatory support (e.g. LVAD), should be considered \nfor patients with potentially reversible or treatable conditions or as a bridge to heart transplant in suitable candidates.\nLVAD may also be used as destination therapy in candidates who are not \nsuitable for transplant. Patients have improvement in their symptoms when compared to optimal medical therapy.\n496,497 However, the rate of rehospitalisations \ndue to complications of bleeding, thrombosis and infections are high.496-498 \nMany patients also go into major depression. Thus, extensive discussion with the patient and family is necessary prior to LVAD implantation.8.7 PALLIATIVE AND END OF LIFE CARE\nDespite recent advances in therapy, for some patients, HF remains a \nprogressive disease and carries a poor prognosis. Patients with refractory symptoms despite guideline-directed medical therapy, should be considered for palliative and end of life care if they have the following characteristics:\n499\n Progressive functional decline (mental and physical) and dependence in  \n most activities of daily living.\n Severe HF symptoms with poor quality of life despite optimal pharmacological \n and non-pharmacological therapies.\n Frequent hospital admissions or serious episodes of decompensation  \n despite optimal therapies.\n Heart transplantation and mechanical circulatory support ruled out.\n Cardiac cachexia.\n Clinically judged to be near end of life.\nThe aim of palliative care in HF is to prevent and relieve suffering and to promote the best quality of life for patients and their families.\n500\nDespite the complexities of end-of-life issues in HF patients, there is minimal evidence-based guidance on the care of this population.\n501 The key components \nof end-of-life care are:\n 1. Advanced care plan with directives and informed decisions on:\n   Use or withdrawal of treatment including advanced therapies such  \n   as V inotropes, ICD and mechanical circulatory support. \n   When it would be appropriate to switch off devices such as ICD or  \n   CRT. \n   Resuscitation status.\n   Preferred location of death (i.e. at home or hospital).\n 2. Symptom management \n  Goals of care at this stage should shift from extending life to controlling \n  symptoms and maximising quality of life. Common symptoms include:\n   Dyspnoea\n   Fatigue\n   Pain\n   Urinary retention \n  Constipation\n  Cachexia\n  Depression\n Medications that may be useful include analgesics, antiemetics, anxiolytics,  \n opioids, laxatives, and diuretics, etc. \n3. Psychosocial support\n The impact of HF on quality of life for the patient and family is complex and  \n extends beyond physical symptoms.502\n Emotional, spiritual and social support should be provided to alleviate patient  \n anxiety about dying, and to guide patient towards a peaceful journey at the end  \n of life.\n9.1 LEVEL OF CARE AND SHARED MANAGEMENT \nThe care of patients with HF should ideally take place in a multidisciplinary system, \nallowing for shared care between the hospital (secondary or tertiary settings) and \ncommunity (primary setting). A multidisciplinary approach encompasses patient \neducation, cardiac rehabilitation, psychosocial support and palliative care, and has been proven to reduce HF hospitalisations and mortality in discharged patients.\n503-505\nThe multidisciplinary team usually consists of cardiologists and or general physicians, HF nurses, pharmacists, dieticians, physiotherapists, primary care \nproviders, social workers as well as geriatricians, psychologists, occupational \ntherapists and when necessary, palliative care specialists. Care can be done in two different settings: \n In the patient’s own home - home-based interventions are associated with  \n significantly lower healthcare costs, reduced hospital readmissions and an  \n improvement in the patient’s quality of life.506 This may however, not be feasible  \n in our local setting.\n Specialist outpatient clinic - the Heart Failure Clinic (HFC). \nHFCs can either be:\n Nurse-directed - these are run by nurses with special training in HF.\n Physician-directed - run by general physicians and/or cardiologists. \nHFCs can be established in the tertiary hospitals or in the primary care setting. The minimum human resource requirements are a:\n Cardiologist or general physician with an interest in cardiology and HF, \n Dedicated nurse and \n Medical technologist for blood taking, doing echocardiography and 6 minutes \n walk tests.In bigger clinic settings, the involvement of physiotherapists to encourage physical \nactivity, pharmacists and counsellors for end of life care would be advisable.\nThese clinics will be the intermediary between in-patient hospital care and community \nprimary care. Patients who can be seen in these clinics include those:507\n Recently discharged after an admission for decompensated HF (a waiting \n time of 7-12 days post discharge has to be the maximum wait-time).\n Who are in the early decompensation phase and need treatment modification.\n Who are stable but need uptitration of HF medications.\n With ICD or CRTs. \n With comorbidities, such as renal dysfunction, diabetes and COPD.\n With advanced HF who may benefit from:\n  Heart transplant\n  Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD)\n  Palliative care.\nThe objectives of these HF clinics may vary based on local settings. These include:\n507,508\n Optimisation of medical therapy particularly the uptitration of β-blockers, ACE-I  \n and MRA. \n Education of the patient and caregiver on the nature of the disease and its  \n progression. \n Promotion of self-care such as :\n  Compliance to medical therapy and fluid restriction.\n  Regular weighing and adjusting diuretic doses according to symptoms and  \n  body weight.\nPatient with optimised HF medications/treatment plans can be discharged to the \ncommunity with appropriate care plans to primary care. Close partnership between these HF clinics and primary care helps to reduce unnecessary admissions to hospital. \nIn 2018, the Heart Failure Medication Therapy Adherence Clinic (MTAC) was \nintroduced. These clinics are conducted by pharmacists in collaboration with doctors and other healthcare providers to improve HF management. The objectives of the Heart Failure MTAC are:\n509\n Enhance patient’s adherence to HF pharmacotherapy and non-pharmacological  \n interventions.\n To reduce unscheduled emergency department visits or hospitalisations of HF  \n patient due to acute decompensation.\n To provide consultative service to doctors on evidence-based HF pharmacotherapy  \n and related issues.\n To collaborate with doctors and other health care professionals in HF management  \n program.9.2 MONITORING AND FOLLOW-UP \nPatients with HF require regular follow-up and monitoring. Serial evaluations serve \nto assess a patient’s status, response to therapy, development of complications and disease progression. Key components of assessment include:\n Functional capacity - NYHA functional class or 6-minute walk test \n Fluid status and body weight \n Blood pressure, heart rate and rhythm \n Examination of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems\n Cognitive status and nutritional status \n Review of pharmacotherapy - uptitration, compliance and side effects\n Serum urea, electrolytes, creatinine and eGFR as necessary\n Diet and sodium intake\n Consumption of alcohol or illicit drugs\n Smoking history.\nThe frequency of follow-up will depend on the patient’s clinical stability and need for pharmacotherapy optimisation. A patient with a recent episode of decompensation or clinical instability, for instance, should ideally be seen again soon, usually within 2 weeks. Ultimately, the intensity and type of follow-up would be determined by the local organisation of care and resources.\nRoutine serial echocardiogram is not recommended. However, if there has been a \nrecent change in clinical status or if the patient has received treatment that might significantly change certain echocardiographic parameters, a follow-up echocardiogram is reasonable to assess the LVEF and structural remodeling.\nSerial brain natriuretic peptide measurements to guide and tailor HF therapy cannot \nbe broadly recommended at the present time due to a lack of consistent evidence.\n29-32 \n9.3 CARDIOLOGY REFERRAL \nHF patients with stable symptoms may be managed at the primary care level. \nReferral to the cardiologist should be considered in the following situations: \n De novo HF for a comprehensive workup to confirm the diagnosis and determine  \n the aetiology, and to devise a management plan.\n Episodes of acute decompensation.\n Worsening HF symptoms despite appropriate therapy. \n HF complicated with symptomatic hypotension or excessive bradycardia, limiting \n uptitration of pharmacotherapy. Symptomatic stable CAD and/or acute coronary syndrome for consideration of  \n revascularisation (PCI or CABG). \n Resuscitated cardiac arrest.\n Documented or suspected significant arrhythmias e.g. AF, VT.\n Significant valvular disease not previously assessed or worsening valvular  \n dysfunction.\n Pre-conception assessment and counselling of women with significant structural  \n heart disease and a past history of HF or LV dysfunction. \n Complex congenital cardiac lesions and/or Eisenmenger’s syndrome.\nDespite taking conventional HF therapy, patients may seek alternative therapy and healing approaches that are not considered as allopathic medicine. The National Centre for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) defines complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) as a group of diverse medical and healthcare interventions, practices, products or disciplines that are not generally considered part of conventional medicine.\n10.1 Enhanced External Counter Pulsation (EECP)\nThere is inadequate evidence of clinical effectiveness of EECP in HF.\n510-513 There is \nconcern that it could precipitate or exacerbate HF. \n10.2 Stem cell therapy\nA global position paper on cardiovascular regenerative medicine stated that \ncell-based therapy in HF patients is neither positive nor consistent.514 \n10.3 Omega 3 fatty acids\nIn patients with HFrEF, it may be considered as an adjunctive therapy based on a \nsingle randomised controlled trial (RCT) which showed a small benefit in CV death and/or hospitalisations.\n515,516 10.4 Coenzyme Q10\nThere is no convincing evidence to support or refute the use of coenzyme Q10 for \npatients with HF.517\n10.5 Tai Chi\nTai Chi may improve 6 min walk test distance, quality of life and LVEF in patients with \nHF.518,519 Its effect on hard CV outcomes such as rehospitalisation, MI and mortality \nis not known. \n10.6 YogaA meta-analysis in 2014 that includes two RCTs concluded that yoga improved peak \nVO2 (exercise capacity) and quality of life in chronic HF patients.\n520 There is an \nongoing RCT to look at the effect of yoga in HFpEF patients.521\nThe focus of future development for HF in Malaysia should be towards service \nenhancement working to meet the World Heart Federation mandate of a 25% reduction in premature non-communicable disease mortality by 2025. \nFinding the balance between costs and quality remains a global challenge, and the \nunderstanding of the disease in our healthcare context is imperative to making sure we move forward regarding service delivery, human resource allocation, medical expense costs and patient outcomes. To achieve this, the following need to be undertaken: \n Epidemiological studies to understand the disease profile in the country.\n Establishment and expansion of HFCs leading to more patient-centred HF care.\n Expanding service delivery, human resource allocation, medical expense cost  \n and patient outcomes.\n Education of healthcare personnel.\nEfforts should be directed to the knowledge and understanding of the epidemiology of HF in our country, its phenotype, presentation, current adherence to guideline-directed therapy and outcomes. Regular cluster sampling cohorts or a nationwide registry should be considered. Understanding the limitations of service delivery albeit geography or human resources and making plans for better service delivery systems \nare important.\nDevelopment of HFCs, can lead to a more patient-centric HF care. (See Section 9, Pages 110-113)\nModules for HF care need to be initiated in order to train and educate general \ninternal medicine physicians. A core-curriculum for education needs to be formed to ensure adequate training has been disseminated to HFC personnel.   \nIncentives regarding HF guidelines compliance should be implemented and HF \ninnovative practice should be encouraged with awards for best clinical practice and innovation be made available. \nThis streamline approach to HF care with engagement of connected groups hopefully \nwill help in better overall patient care and experience.\nPerformance measures should be used with the goal of improving quality of care for HF.\n518,519\nProcess performance measures focus on the aspects of care that are delivered to a patient, \nwhile outcome measures focus on the end-points such as mortality or hospitalisation.\nProcess performance indicators for in-patients with HF includes:522-524\n % of patients who had documentation of NYHA Functional Class.\n % of patients who had LVEF measurement.\n % of patients with current or prior LVEF < 40% and without contraindications  \n discharged with ACE-I/ARB. \n % of patients with current or prior LVEF < 40% and without contraindications  \n discharged on β-blockers.\n % of patients with current or prior LVEF < 40% and without contraindications  \n discharged on MRA.\n % of patients with chronic or paroxysmal AF/atrial flutter without contraindications  \n on anticoagulant therapy at discharge.\n % of patients given a post discharge appointment.\nThe accepted performance measure should be more than 60%.Outcome measures indicators include:\n In-hospital mortality\n 30-day readmission for HF\nRefer to Appendix VI, Page 121 for calculation of these measures."

Cardiomyopathy characterised by a decrease in Ejection Fraction (EF)  \n globally or due to regional changes in interventricular septum contraction. \n2. Symptoms of HF.3. Signs associated with HF including but not limited to S3 gallop, tachycardia,  \n or both.4. Decline in initial EF of at least 5% to < 55% with signs and symptoms of  \n HF or asymptomatic decrease in EF of at least 10% to < 55%.Chemotherapy drugs that have been associated with HF include (Appendix V, Page120):\n Doxorubicin \n  5% at a cumulative dose of 400mg/m2 (the higher the cumulative dose, \n  the greater the risk of HF.445  \n  Even at lower doses of 180 to 240mg/m2, subclinical events can  \n  occur in up to 30% of patients about 13 years post treatment.448\n  These suggest that there is no ‘safe’ dose for doxorubicin. \n Cyclophosphamide especially in high doses and ifosfomide.449,450  \n Newer agents such as monoclonal antibodies (trastuzumab and pertuzumab), \n small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (imatinib, sunitinib, sorafenib)  \n and the proteasome inhibitor (bortezomib).  Trastuzumab especially when administered together with anthracyclines \n  and cyclophosphamide, has been associated with an increased incidence \n  of HF of 27% compared to 1.7% to 4.1% when anthracycline was not part  \n  of the therapeutic regimen.\n451-453 Symptoms are usually mild to moderate \n  and improve following medical management and termination of drug  \n  administration. Improvement is usually seen in about 4-6 weeks after    withdrawal of the agent.\n454-456 After symptomatic improvement, \n  reinstitution  of treatment is usually possible.454-456\n  Vascular endothelial growth factor signaling pathway (VSP) inhibitors  \n  (bevacizumab) can cause hypertension. Bevacizumab also blocks  \n  receptors that are involved in the compensatory response to stress in  \n  the cardiomyocytes and when the heart is unable to compensate for  \n  the hypertension, it could lead to HF.457,458 Maintaining good blood pressure \n  control can prevent HF associated with this agent. Heart failure due to  \n  VSP inhibitors is usually reversible with cessation of the agent.459\nOne must consider both the efficacy and the toxicity in choosing chemotherapeutic agents. Many of the newer targeted agents cause a reversible form of HF and symptoms usually resolve after the initiation of anti-failure medications.\n454-456,459,460 \nRisk factors for anthracycline toxicity include: 461-465\n The total cumulative dose\n Intravenous bolus administration versus infusion\n Higher single doses\n History of prior irradiation\n Use of concomitant agents known to have cardiotoxicity\n Female gender\n Underlying CV disease\n Age (young and elderly)\n An increase in cardiac biomarkers such as troponins during and   after administration is an indication of toxicity.8.5.5.1 Management\n Patients undergoing chemotherapy should have a careful clinical evaluation \n and assessment and treatment of CV risk factors.464,465\n Blood pressure control is important in all patients especially in those  \n being considered for VSP inhibitors.\n All patients with potential cardiotoxic chemotherapy should have an  \n echocardiogram prior to treatment. An important parameter is the LVEF  \n determined using the biplane method of discs (Simpson’s method) or  \n three-dimensional echocardiography where available. Newer techniques   to detect and quantitate regional and global myocardial dysfunction  \n (strain assessment with global longitudinal strain) can be used to detect  \n pre-clinical and subtle changes in function.\n466-469 \n Biomarkers such as troponin and natriuretic peptides can help identify  \n patients at higher risk.462,463,470,471 \nClose collaboration between the oncologist and the cardiologist is important. \nFor the oncologists, the strategy (prior to commencement) includes:465\n Identifying high risk patients (pre-existing heart disease, presence of  \n CV risk factors, age - young and old, female gender, use of high dose  \n anthracycline regimens).\n High risk patients should:\n  Have a pre-treatment cardiac function evaluation. If the LVEF is < 50%,  \n  refer to the cardiologist.  Be considered for non-cardiotoxic alternatives. \n  Have their therapy protocols adjusted where necessary (e.g. reduction \n  in doses, continuous infusions rather than bolus injections, liposomal    doxorubicin, dexrazoxane etc). \nFor the cardiologists/general physicians, the strategy includes:\n Treating CV risk factors. \n Assessing, repeating (if necessary) imaging studies. (e.g. using high  \n quality LVEF measurement, strain evaluation etc).\n Assessing cardiac biomarkers (troponin and/or NP).\n Considering cardio-protection prior to/or during treatment using β-blockers,  \n MRA and/or ACE-I/ARB if:69,465,472-474\n  EF < 50%, \n  EF drops by > 10%\n  Abnormal global longitudinal strain (GLS) (> 15% drop).  Monitoring LVEF during therapy is important with repeat echocardiography  \n at 3-monthly intervals and/or according to symptoms. If cardioprotective  \n medications are given, monitoring may be necessary at closer intervals of  \n time depending on the clinical condition of the patient e.g. 1-monthly interval. \n Withholding cardiotoxic therapy only as a last resort. (for anthracycline  \n LVEF < 45%, for anti-HER2 therapy LVEF < 40%).\n Monitoring even after completion of therapy:\n  Obtain post therapy LVEF.\n  Repeat echocardiography in 6 months or 1 year. Most cases of  \n  treatment-associated cardiac dysfunction develop within the first year  \n  after completion of therapy.475,476 \n  If EF remains abnormal, follow guidelines for management of HF.465 \n \n8.5.6 HEART FAILURE AND KIDNEY DYSFUNCTION\n8.5.6.1 Epidemiology, definitions and classifications Cardiac and pre-existing kidney disease at admission frequently co-exist, \nvarying from 45.4% in patients with chronic HF to > 60% in those with AHF.\n477,478 \nIn addition, during treatment of AHF, a significant proportion of patients will develop varying degrees of worsening renal function (WRF).\nThe definition of WRF is:\n479\n An increase in serum creatinine by ≥ 26.5μmol/ L (0.3mg/dl) and/or\n A ≥ 25% increase in serum creatinine or a ≥ 20% drop in eGFR.\nThe rise in serum creatinine usually occurs in the first three to five days of \nhospitalisation. The incidence of WRF is estimated to be between 19 and 45%.165 This large \nobserved range is due to variations in the definitions of WRF, the observed time-at-risk and the study population.\n165 \nRisk factors for WRF during admission for HF include:480\n A prior history of HF or diabetes, \n An admission serum creatinine of > 133μmol/L,  or \n Systolic blood pressure > 160mmHg. \nWRF may fulfill criteria for type 1 or type 2 cardiorenal syndrome (CRS). The term “cardiorenal syndrome” refers to disorders of the heart and kidneys whereby acute or chronic dysfunction in one organ may induce acute or chronic dysfunction of the other.\n165 \nThis syndrome has been classified by the Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative working group into 5 subtypes as shown in Table 17, Page 105.\n165 Many \npatients however, may belong to more than one subtype and may move between subtypes during the course of their disease.\n165\n8.5.6.2. Pathogenesis of CRS \nMultiple mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of CRS. These include:\n Increased renal venous pressure  - venous congestion is probably the  \n most important factor.481 \n RV dysfunction.\n Reduced renal perfusion with reduced cardiac output. \n Neurohumoral adaptations (e.g. activation of the sympathetic nervous  \n system and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, increases in  \n vasopressin and endothelin-1).8.5.6.3  Clinical significance /Impact of kidney dysfunction in HF  The combination of cardiac and kidney disease increases the complexity and \ncosts of care, and may interact to worsen prognosis. \nA. Pharmacologic considerations \n Safety:\n  Dosing of renally-excreted cardiac drugs need adjustment in the  \n  presence of renal impairment (e.g. digoxin, insulin, low molecular  \n  weight heparin).\n  Patients with HF are at increased risk of contrast-induced acute kidney \n  injury. \n Efficacy:\n  Impaired renal function will affect drug choices and dosing. If eGFR <  \n  30mls/min/1.73m2, most thiazide diuretics are no longer effective and  \n  loop diuretics are preferred. Higher doses of loop diuretics may be   \n  required with increasing renal impairment.             B. Prognostic implications\n Preexisting CKD is a bad prognostic indicator in patients with HF - the  \n more severe the CKD, the worse the mortality.482,483\n In patients with HF, WRF may not always indicate a poor outcome.484 The  \n prognostic value of WRF is mainly determined by:   The presence of persistent congestion  \n  Baseline renal function and magnitude of renal changes \n  Duration - persistent WRF is usually associated with hemodynamic  \n  derangements and poor prognosis as compared with transient WRF  \n  as a result of agressive decongestive therapy.485-487\nTable 17: Classification of Cardiorenal Syndrome (CRS)8.5.6.4. Management \n A multi-disciplinary approach is recommended. Early referral to a  \n nephrologist is advisable.   \n Exclude potentially reversible causes for increasing renal dysfunction  \n such as hyper - or hypovolaemia, concomitant medications such as  \n aminoglycosides and NSAIDs, ACE-I or ARB and renal artery stenosis. \n Closely monitor electrolytes and kidney function, especially during acute  \n illnesses, dehydration and when increasing doses of cardiac drugs  \n including diuretics. The baseline renal function will determine how frequently \n this should be done. \n The recommended range for serum potassium is 4-5.5mmol/L.488 \n Wherever possible, avoid nephrotoxins, e.g. contrast media for angiography\n Intravenous diuretics \n  Loop diuretics are the first choice.\n  Continuous infusion may not have greater benefits compared with  \n  bolus dosing.115-118,489\n  Start initially with 2-2.5 times the usual oral dose. \n  Combination therapy (loop diuretic and thiazide/thiazide-like diuretic/\n  mineralocorticoid) may be required to enhance diuresis.205-207 However,  \n  care is required to avoid electrolyte disturbances, hypovolaemia and  \n  worsening renal dysfunction. \n Careful use of Renin Angiotensin System (RAS) blockers  \n  HF patients with stable, chronic mild-moderate renal insufficiency  \n  (eGFR > 30mls/min/1.73m2) should receive standard therapy with an  \n  ACE-I/ ARB and an MRA.490\n  A serum creatinine rise or GFR decrease by up to 30% from baseline  \n  may be acceptable before it becomes necessary to consider stopping  \n  or decreasing doses.221 \n  In patients with advanced renal failure, the decision to start or stop  \n  RAS blockers should be individualised.490\n  Consider withholding RAS blockers during aggressive diuresis in  \n  patients at high risk for WRF.  RAS blockers (and β-blockers) can be used in patients with HF who  \n  are on chronic dialysis therapy.\n Ultrafiltration \n  This involves the removal of plasma water across a semi-permeable  \n  membrane in response to a transmembrane pressure gradient.   It may be considered for congestive symptoms refractory to diuresis,  \n  but should be used in consultation with a nephrologist.\n491\n  Evidence for its efficacy in fluid removal is mixed at present.491  Haemodialysis \n  Criteria for possible need to initiate renal replacement therapy include:\n   Oliguria unresponsive to fluid resuscitation.\n   Severe hyperkalaemia (serum potassium > 6.5mmol/L).\n   Severe acidaemia (pH < 7.2). \n   Serum urea > 25mmol/L. \n    Serum creatinine > 300μmol/L. \n8.6  ADVANCED HEART FAILURE/REFRACTORY HEART FAILURE\nThese are patients with severe symptoms of HF despite maximal medical \ntherapy. Hospital admission is necessary for stabilisation. Meticulous control of fluid balance is important. Aggravating causes of HF as listed in Table 5, Page 39 should be identified and treated.\nThese patients may need specialised treatment in CCU or ICU. The following \nmay be required:\n Intravenous infusion of frusemide. These patients may require combination  \n loop diuretics and thiazides.\n Intravenous infusion of inotropes - low dose dobutamine (5mcg/kg/min) or  \n milrinone. These improve symptoms but no survival benefit has been  \n demonstrated.126,492\n Ultrafiltration in patients who are fluid overloaded.493 In most patients,  \n however, the relief is temporary.\nThe prognosis of these patients is poor. They should be referred to assess \nwhether they may be potential candidates for mechanical circulatory support (e.g. LVAD) and consideration for heart transplant.\n8.6.1 HEART TRANSPLANTHeart transplantation is a well-established treatment of refractory end stage \nHF. This definitive therapy for HF however is limited by the lack of donor organs.\n494,495All patients with severe symptomatic HF despite optimal medical therapy and \nno other alternative therapy option should be considered for heart transplant. They need to be referred to a HF specialist cardiac hospital for further evaluation.\nAssessment for heart transplant is done by a multispeciality, multidisciplinary \nteam and appropriate work up will be performed for eligibility.\nEligibility criteria to be considered for heart transplant include:\n Poor LVEF (< 25%).\n Recurrent HF hospitalisations.\n Major limitation of the patient’s daily activities.\n Poor effort tolerance i.e. peak VO2 (maximal oxygen consumption or  \n peak oxygen uptake) less than 10ml/kg/min (or < 50% predicted). VO2  \n max is the maximum rate of oxygen consumption measured during  \n incremental exercise ie exercise of increasing intensity and is widely  \n used as an indicator of cardiorespiratory fitness.\n Intravenous inotropic dependence for symptomatic relief or to maintain  \n end organ function.\n Motivated, psychologically stable and compliant to therapy.\nContraindications to heart transplant\n Active infection.\n Severe peripheral arterial or cerebrovascular disease.\n Malignancy within 5 years.\n Diabetes mellitus with widespread microvascular complications.\n Systemic disease with multi-organ dysfunction.\n Irreversible chronic kidney, liver or lung disease.\n Pharmacologically irreversible pulmonary hypertension.\n Other medical or psychosocial issues that would impact survival.\n8.6.2 MECHANICAL CIRCULATORY SUPPORT The use of mechanical circulatory support (e.g. LVAD), should be considered \nfor patients with potentially reversible or treatable conditions or as a bridge to heart transplant in suitable candidates.\nLVAD may also be used as destination therapy in candidates who are not \nsuitable for transplant. Patients have improvement in their symptoms when compared to optimal medical therapy.\n496,497 However, the rate of rehospitalisations \ndue to complications of bleeding, thrombosis and infections are high.496-498 \nMany patients also go into major depression. Thus, extensive discussion with the patient and family is necessary prior to LVAD implantation.8.7 PALLIATIVE AND END OF LIFE CARE\nDespite recent advances in therapy, for some patients, HF remains a \nprogressive disease and carries a poor prognosis. Patients with refractory symptoms despite guideline-directed medical therapy, should be considered for palliative and end of life care if they have the following characteristics:\n499\n Progressive functional decline (mental and physical) and dependence in  \n most activities of daily living.\n Severe HF symptoms with poor quality of life despite optimal pharmacological \n and non-pharmacological therapies.\n Frequent hospital admissions or serious episodes of decompensation  \n despite optimal therapies.\n Heart transplantation and mechanical circulatory support ruled out.\n Cardiac cachexia.\n Clinically judged to be near end of life.\nThe aim of palliative care in HF is to prevent and relieve suffering and to promote the best quality of life for patients and their families.\n500\nDespite the complexities of end-of-life issues in HF patients, there is minimal evidence-based guidance on the care of this population.\n501 The key components \nof end-of-life care are:\n 1. Advanced care plan with directives and informed decisions on:\n   Use or withdrawal of treatment including advanced therapies such  \n   as V inotropes, ICD and mechanical circulatory support. \n   When it would be appropriate to switch off devices such as ICD or  \n   CRT. \n   Resuscitation status.\n   Preferred location of death (i.e. at home or hospital).\n 2. Symptom management \n  Goals of care at this stage should shift from extending life to controlling \n  symptoms and maximising quality of life. Common symptoms include:\n   Dyspnoea\n   Fatigue\n   Pain\n   Urinary retention \n  Constipation\n  Cachexia\n  Depression\n Medications that may be useful include analgesics, antiemetics, anxiolytics,  \n opioids, laxatives, and diuretics, etc. \n3. Psychosocial support\n The impact of HF on quality of life for the patient and family is complex and  \n extends beyond physical symptoms.502\n Emotional, spiritual and social support should be provided to alleviate patient  \n anxiety about dying, and to guide patient towards a peaceful journey at the end  \n of life.\n9.1 LEVEL OF CARE AND SHARED MANAGEMENT \nThe care of patients with HF should ideally take place in a multidisciplinary system, \nallowing for shared care between the hospital (secondary or tertiary settings) and \ncommunity (primary setting). A multidisciplinary approach encompasses patient \neducation, cardiac rehabilitation, psychosocial support and palliative care, and has been proven to reduce HF hospitalisations and mortality in discharged patients.\n503-505\nThe multidisciplinary team usually consists of cardiologists and or general physicians, HF nurses, pharmacists, dieticians, physiotherapists, primary care \nproviders, social workers as well as geriatricians, psychologists, occupational \ntherapists and when necessary, palliative care specialists. Care can be done in two different settings: \n In the patient’s own home - home-based interventions are associated with  \n significantly lower healthcare costs, reduced hospital readmissions and an  \n improvement in the patient’s quality of life.506 This may however, not be feasible  \n in our local setting.\n Specialist outpatient clinic - the Heart Failure Clinic (HFC). \nHFCs can either be:\n Nurse-directed - these are run by nurses with special training in HF.\n Physician-directed - run by general physicians and/or cardiologists. \nHFCs can be established in the tertiary hospitals or in the primary care setting. The minimum human resource requirements are a:\n Cardiologist or general physician with an interest in cardiology and HF, \n Dedicated nurse and \n Medical technologist for blood taking, doing echocardiography and 6 minutes \n walk tests.In bigger clinic settings, the involvement of physiotherapists to encourage physical \nactivity, pharmacists and counsellors for end of life care would be advisable.\nThese clinics will be the intermediary between in-patient hospital care and community \nprimary care. Patients who can be seen in these clinics include those:507\n Recently discharged after an admission for decompensated HF (a waiting \n time of 7-12 days post discharge has to be the maximum wait-time).\n Who are in the early decompensation phase and need treatment modification.\n Who are stable but need uptitration of HF medications.\n With ICD or CRTs. \n With comorbidities, such as renal dysfunction, diabetes and COPD.\n With advanced HF who may benefit from:\n  Heart transplant\n  Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD)\n  Palliative care.\nThe objectives of these HF clinics may vary based on local settings. These include:\n507,508\n Optimisation of medical therapy particularly the uptitration of β-blockers, ACE-I  \n and MRA. \n Education of the patient and caregiver on the nature of the disease and its  \n progression. \n Promotion of self-care such as :\n  Compliance to medical therapy and fluid restriction.\n  Regular weighing and adjusting diuretic doses according to symptoms and  \n  body weight.\nPatient with optimised HF medications/treatment plans can be discharged to the \ncommunity with appropriate care plans to primary care. Close partnership between these HF clinics and primary care helps to reduce unnecessary admissions to hospital. \nIn 2018, the Heart Failure Medication Therapy Adherence Clinic (MTAC) was \nintroduced. These clinics are conducted by pharmacists in collaboration with doctors and other healthcare providers to improve HF management. The objectives of the Heart Failure MTAC are:\n509\n Enhance patient’s adherence to HF pharmacotherapy and non-pharmacological  \n interventions.\n To reduce unscheduled emergency department visits or hospitalisations of HF  \n patient due to acute decompensation.\n To provide consultative service to doctors on evidence-based HF pharmacotherapy  \n and related issues.\n To collaborate with doctors and other health care professionals in HF management  \n program.9.2 MONITORING AND FOLLOW-UP \nPatients with HF require regular follow-up and monitoring. Serial evaluations serve \nto assess a patient’s status, response to therapy, development of complications and disease progression. Key components of assessment include:\n Functional capacity - NYHA functional class or 6-minute walk test \n Fluid status and body weight \n Blood pressure, heart rate and rhythm \n Examination of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems\n Cognitive status and nutritional status \n Review of pharmacotherapy - uptitration, compliance and side effects\n Serum urea, electrolytes, creatinine and eGFR as necessary\n Diet and sodium intake\n Consumption of alcohol or illicit drugs\n Smoking history.\nThe frequency of follow-up will depend on the patient’s clinical stability and need for pharmacotherapy optimisation. A patient with a recent episode of decompensation or clinical instability, for instance, should ideally be seen again soon, usually within 2 weeks. Ultimately, the intensity and type of follow-up would be determined by the local organisation of care and resources.\nRoutine serial echocardiogram is not recommended. However, if there has been a \nrecent change in clinical status or if the patient has received treatment that might significantly change certain echocardiographic parameters, a follow-up echocardiogram is reasonable to assess the LVEF and structural remodeling.\nSerial brain natriuretic peptide measurements to guide and tailor HF therapy cannot \nbe broadly recommended at the present time due to a lack of consistent evidence.\n29-32 \n9.3 CARDIOLOGY REFERRAL \nHF patients with stable symptoms may be managed at the primary care level. \nReferral to the cardiologist should be considered in the following situations: \n De novo HF for a comprehensive workup to confirm the diagnosis and determine  \n the aetiology, and to devise a management plan.\n Episodes of acute decompensation.\n Worsening HF symptoms despite appropriate therapy. \n HF complicated with symptomatic hypotension or excessive bradycardia, limiting \n uptitration of pharmacotherapy. Symptomatic stable CAD and/or acute coronary syndrome for consideration of  \n revascularisation (PCI or CABG). \n Resuscitated cardiac arrest.\n Documented or suspected significant arrhythmias e.g. AF, VT.\n Significant valvular disease not previously assessed or worsening valvular  \n dysfunction.\n Pre-conception assessment and counselling of women with significant structural  \n heart disease and a past history of HF or LV dysfunction. \n Complex congenital cardiac lesions and/or Eisenmenger’s syndrome.\nDespite taking conventional HF therapy, patients may seek alternative therapy and healing approaches that are not considered as allopathic medicine. The National Centre for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) defines complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) as a group of diverse medical and healthcare interventions, practices, products or disciplines that are not generally considered part of conventional medicine.\n10.1 Enhanced External Counter Pulsation (EECP)\nThere is inadequate evidence of clinical effectiveness of EECP in HF.\n510-513 There is \nconcern that it could precipitate or exacerbate HF. \n10.2 Stem cell therapy\nA global position paper on cardiovascular regenerative medicine stated that \ncell-based therapy in HF patients is neither positive nor consistent.514 \n10.3 Omega 3 fatty acids\nIn patients with HFrEF, it may be considered as an adjunctive therapy based on a \nsingle randomised controlled trial (RCT) which showed a small benefit in CV death and/or hospitalisations.\n515,516 10.4 Coenzyme Q10\nThere is no convincing evidence to support or refute the use of coenzyme Q10 for \npatients with HF.517\n10.5 Tai Chi\nTai Chi may improve 6 min walk test distance, quality of life and LVEF in patients with \nHF.518,519 Its effect on hard CV outcomes such as rehospitalisation, MI and mortality \nis not known. \n10.6 YogaA meta-analysis in 2014 that includes two RCTs concluded that yoga improved peak \nVO2 (exercise capacity) and quality of life in chronic HF patients.\n520 There is an \nongoing RCT to look at the effect of yoga in HFpEF patients.521\nThe focus of future development for HF in Malaysia should be towards service \nenhancement working to meet the World Heart Federation mandate of a 25% reduction in premature non-communicable disease mortality by 2025. \nFinding the balance between costs and quality remains a global challenge, and the \nunderstanding of the disease in our healthcare context is imperative to making sure we move forward regarding service delivery, human resource allocation, medical expense costs and patient outcomes. To achieve this, the following need to be undertaken: \n Epidemiological studies to understand the disease profile in the country.\n Establishment and expansion of HFCs leading to more patient-centred HF care.\n Expanding service delivery, human resource allocation, medical expense cost  \n and patient outcomes.\n Education of healthcare personnel.\nEfforts should be directed to the knowledge and understanding of the epidemiology of HF in our country, its phenotype, presentation, current adherence to guideline-directed therapy and outcomes. Regular cluster sampling cohorts or a nationwide registry should be considered. Understanding the limitations of service delivery albeit geography or human resources and making plans for better service delivery systems \nare important.\nDevelopment of HFCs, can lead to a more patient-centric HF care. (See Section 9, Pages 110-113)\nModules for HF care need to be initiated in order to train and educate general \ninternal medicine physicians. A core-curriculum for education needs to be formed to ensure adequate training has been disseminated to HFC personnel.   \nIncentives regarding HF guidelines compliance should be implemented and HF \ninnovative practice should be encouraged with awards for best clinical practice and innovation be made available. \nThis streamline approach to HF care with engagement of connected groups hopefully \nwill help in better overall patient care and experience.\nPerformance measures should be used with the goal of improving quality of care for HF.\n518,519\nProcess performance measures focus on the aspects of care that are delivered to a patient, \nwhile outcome measures focus on the end-points such as mortality or hospitalisation.\nProcess performance indicators for in-patients with HF includes:522-524\n % of patients who had documentation of NYHA Functional Class.\n % of patients who had LVEF measurement.\n % of patients with current or prior LVEF < 40% and without contraindications  \n discharged with ACE-I/ARB. \n % of patients with current or prior LVEF < 40% and without contraindications  \n discharged on β-blockers.\n % of patients with current or prior LVEF < 40% and without contraindications  \n discharged on MRA.\n % of patients with chronic or paroxysmal AF/atrial flutter without contraindications  \n on anticoagulant therapy at discharge.\n % of patients given a post discharge appointment.\nThe accepted performance measure should be more than 60%.Outcome measures indicators include:\n In-hospital mortality\n 30-day readmission for HF\nRefer to Appendix VI, Page 121 for calculation of these measures."

        "text": "1098.5.5 CARDIO-ONCOLOGY AND HEART FAILURE\nHeart disease and cancer are often linked due to:\n Common risk factors (e.g. increasing age and cigarette smoking)\n Treatment strategies \n  Chemotherapy drugs has been associated with HF, arrhythmias,  \n  vasculitis and thromboembolic disease.\n  Radiotherapy of the mediastinum and left chest can lead to CAD,  \n  myopericardial fibrosis and valvular dysfunction.\nDyspnoea in cancer patients could be due to:\n Fluid overload.\n Cardiomyopathy due to chemotherapeutic agents, stress (Takotsubo), or  \n underlying CAD.\n The primary cancer causing anaemia, lung and pericardial involvement. \nChemotherapy-induced cardiomyopathy is not common, clinical HF occurs in \n1-5% and an asymptomatic decrease in LV function in the range of 5% to 20%.\n442 Prognosis in the patients who develop HF is poor.443\nThe anthracycline class of chemotherapeutic agents remain the major cause of chemotherapy-induced cardiomyopathy.\n444,445 In the current era, newer \nagents have also been implicated in a reversible form of cardiomyopathy.446 \nChemotherapy-induced cardiomyopathy as defined by the Cardiac Review and Evaluation Committee is the presence of at least one or more of the following:\n447\n1. Cardiomyopathy characterised by a decrease in Ejection Fraction (EF)  \n globally or due to regional changes in interventricular septum contraction. \n2. Symptoms of HF.3. Signs associated with HF including but not limited to S3 gallop, tachycardia,  \n or both.4. Decline in initial EF of at least 5% to < 55% with signs and symptoms of  \n HF or asymptomatic decrease in EF of at least 10% to < 55%.Chemotherapy drugs that have been associated with HF include (Appendix V, Page120):\n Doxorubicin \n  5% at a cumulative dose of 400mg/m2 (the higher the cumulative dose, \n  the greater the risk of HF.445  \n  Even at lower doses of 180 to 240mg/m2, subclinical events can  \n  occur in up to 30% of patients about 13 years post treatment.448\n  These suggest that there is no ‘safe’ dose for doxorubicin. \n Cyclophosphamide especially in high doses and ifosfomide.449,450  \n Newer agents such as monoclonal antibodies (trastuzumab and pertuzumab), \n small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (imatinib, sunitinib, sorafenib)  \n and the proteasome inhibitor (bortezomib).  Trastuzumab especially when administered together with anthracyclines \n  and cyclophosphamide, has been associated with an increased incidence \n  of HF of 27% compared to 1.7% to 4.1% when anthracycline was not part  \n  of the therapeutic regimen.\n451-453 Symptoms are usually mild to moderate \n  and improve following medical management and termination of drug  \n  administration. Improvement is usually seen in about 4-6 weeks after    withdrawal of the agent.\n454-456 After symptomatic improvement, \n  reinstitution  of treatment is usually possible.454-456\n  Vascular endothelial growth factor signaling pathway (VSP) inhibitors  \n  (bevacizumab) can cause hypertension. Bevacizumab also blocks  \n  receptors that are involved in the compensatory response to stress in  \n  the cardiomyocytes and when the heart is unable to compensate for  \n  the hypertension, it could lead to HF.457,458 Maintaining good blood pressure \n  control can prevent HF associated with this agent. Heart failure due to  \n  VSP inhibitors is usually reversible with cessation of the agent.459\nOne must consider both the efficacy and the toxicity in choosing chemotherapeutic agents. Many of the newer targeted agents cause a reversible form of HF and symptoms usually resolve after the initiation of anti-failure medications.\n454-456,459,460 \nRisk factors for anthracycline toxicity include: 461-465\n The total cumulative dose\n Intravenous bolus administration versus infusion\n Higher single doses\n History of prior irradiation\n Use of concomitant agents known to have cardiotoxicity\n Female gender\n Underlying CV disease\n Age (young and elderly)\n An increase in cardiac biomarkers such as troponins during and   after administration is an indication of toxicity.8.5.5.1 Management\n Patients undergoing chemotherapy should have a careful clinical evaluation \n and assessment and treatment of CV risk factors.464,465\n Blood pressure control is important in all patients especially in those  \n being considered for VSP inhibitors.\n All patients with potential cardiotoxic chemotherapy should have an  \n echocardiogram prior to treatment. An important parameter is the LVEF  \n determined using the biplane method of discs (Simpson’s method) or  \n three-dimensional echocardiography where available. Newer techniques   to detect and quantitate regional and global myocardial dysfunction  \n (strain assessment with global longitudinal strain) can be used to detect  \n pre-clinical and subtle changes in function.\n466-469 \n Biomarkers such as troponin and natriuretic peptides can help identify  \n patients at higher risk.462,463,470,471 \nClose collaboration between the oncologist and the cardiologist is important. \nFor the oncologists, the strategy (prior to commencement) includes:465\n Identifying high risk patients (pre-existing heart disease, presence of  \n CV risk factors, age - young and old, female gender, use of high dose  \n anthracycline regimens).\n High risk patients should:\n  Have a pre-treatment cardiac function evaluation. If the LVEF is < 50%,  \n  refer to the cardiologist.  Be considered for non-cardiotoxic alternatives. \n  Have their therapy protocols adjusted where necessary (e.g. reduction \n  in doses, continuous infusions rather than bolus injections, liposomal    doxorubicin, dexrazoxane etc). \nFor the cardiologists/general physicians, the strategy includes:\n Treating CV risk factors. \n Assessing, repeating (if necessary) imaging studies. (e.g. using high  \n quality LVEF measurement, strain evaluation etc).\n Assessing cardiac biomarkers (troponin and/or NP).\n Considering cardio-protection prior to/or during treatment using β-blockers,  \n MRA and/or ACE-I/ARB if:69,465,472-474\n  EF < 50%, \n  EF drops by > 10%\n  Abnormal global longitudinal strain (GLS) (> 15% drop).  Monitoring LVEF during therapy is important with repeat echocardiography  \n at 3-monthly intervals and/or according to symptoms. If cardioprotective  \n medications are given, monitoring may be necessary at closer intervals of  \n time depending on the clinical condition of the patient e.g. 1-monthly interval. \n Withholding cardiotoxic therapy only as a last resort. (for anthracycline  \n LVEF < 45%, for anti-HER2 therapy LVEF < 40%).\n Monitoring even after completion of therapy:\n  Obtain post therapy LVEF.\n  Repeat echocardiography in 6 months or 1 year. Most cases of  \n  treatment-associated cardiac dysfunction develop within the first year  \n  after completion of therapy.475,476 \n  If EF remains abnormal, follow guidelines for management of HF.465 \n \n8.5.6 HEART FAILURE AND KIDNEY DYSFUNCTION\n8.5.6.1 Epidemiology, definitions and classifications Cardiac and pre-existing kidney disease at admission frequently co-exist, \nvarying from 45.4% in patients with chronic HF to > 60% in those with AHF.\n477,478 \nIn addition, during treatment of AHF, a significant proportion of patients will develop varying degrees of worsening renal function (WRF).\nThe definition of WRF is:\n479\n An increase in serum creatinine by ≥ 26.5μmol/ L (0.3mg/dl) and/or\n A ≥ 25% increase in serum creatinine or a ≥ 20% drop in eGFR.\nThe rise in serum creatinine usually occurs in the first three to five days of \nhospitalisation. The incidence of WRF is estimated to be between 19 and 45%.165 This large \nobserved range is due to variations in the definitions of WRF, the observed time-at-risk and the study population.\n165 \nRisk factors for WRF during admission for HF include:480\n A prior history of HF or diabetes, \n An admission serum creatinine of > 133μmol/L,  or \n Systolic blood pressure > 160mmHg. \nWRF may fulfill criteria for type 1 or type 2 cardiorenal syndrome (CRS). The term “cardiorenal syndrome” refers to disorders of the heart and kidneys whereby acute or chronic dysfunction in one organ may induce acute or chronic dysfunction of the other.\n165 \nThis syndrome has been classified by the Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative working group into 5 subtypes as shown in Table 17, Page 105.\n165 Many \npatients however, may belong to more than one subtype and may move between subtypes during the course of their disease.\n165\n8.5.6.2. Pathogenesis of CRS \nMultiple mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of CRS. These include:\n Increased renal venous pressure  - venous congestion is probably the  \n most important factor.481 \n RV dysfunction.\n Reduced renal perfusion with reduced cardiac output. \n Neurohumoral adaptations (e.g. activation of the sympathetic nervous  \n system and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, increases in  \n vasopressin and endothelin-1).8.5.6.3  Clinical significance /Impact of kidney dysfunction in HF  The combination of cardiac and kidney disease increases the complexity and \ncosts of care, and may interact to worsen prognosis. \nA. Pharmacologic considerations \n Safety:\n  Dosing of renally-excreted cardiac drugs need adjustment in the  \n  presence of renal impairment (e.g. digoxin, insulin, low molecular  \n  weight heparin).\n  Patients with HF are at increased risk of contrast-induced acute kidney \n  injury. \n Efficacy:\n  Impaired renal function will affect drug choices and dosing. If eGFR <  \n  30mls/min/1.73m2, most thiazide diuretics are no longer effective and  \n  loop diuretics are preferred. Higher doses of loop diuretics may be   \n  required with increasing renal impairment.             B. Prognostic implications\n Preexisting CKD is a bad prognostic indicator in patients with HF - the  \n more severe the CKD, the worse the mortality.482,483\n In patients with HF, WRF may not always indicate a poor outcome.484 The  \n prognostic value of WRF is mainly determined by:   The presence of persistent congestion  \n  Baseline renal function and magnitude of renal changes \n  Duration - persistent WRF is usually associated with hemodynamic  \n  derangements and poor prognosis as compared with transient WRF  \n  as a result of agressive decongestive therapy.485-487\nTable 17: Classification of Cardiorenal Syndrome (CRS)8.5.6.4. Management \n A multi-disciplinary approach is recommended. Early referral to a  \n nephrologist is advisable.   \n Exclude potentially reversible causes for increasing renal dysfunction  \n such as hyper - or hypovolaemia, concomitant medications such as  \n aminoglycosides and NSAIDs, ACE-I or ARB and renal artery stenosis. \n Closely monitor electrolytes and kidney function, especially during acute  \n illnesses, dehydration and when increasing doses of cardiac drugs  \n including diuretics. The baseline renal function will determine how frequently \n this should be done. \n The recommended range for serum potassium is 4-5.5mmol/L.488 \n Wherever possible, avoid nephrotoxins, e.g. contrast media for angiography\n Intravenous diuretics \n  Loop diuretics are the first choice.\n  Continuous infusion may not have greater benefits compared with  \n  bolus dosing.115-118,489\n  Start initially with 2-2.5 times the usual oral dose. \n  Combination therapy (loop diuretic and thiazide/thiazide-like diuretic/\n  mineralocorticoid) may be required to enhance diuresis.205-207 However,  \n  care is required to avoid electrolyte disturbances, hypovolaemia and  \n  worsening renal dysfunction. \n Careful use of Renin Angiotensin System (RAS) blockers  \n  HF patients with stable, chronic mild-moderate renal insufficiency  \n  (eGFR > 30mls/min/1.73m2) should receive standard therapy with an  \n  ACE-I/ ARB and an MRA.490\n  A serum creatinine rise or GFR decrease by up to 30% from baseline  \n  may be acceptable before it becomes necessary to consider stopping  \n  or decreasing doses.221 \n  In patients with advanced renal failure, the decision to start or stop  \n  RAS blockers should be individualised.490\n  Consider withholding RAS blockers during aggressive diuresis in  \n  patients at high risk for WRF.  RAS blockers (and β-blockers) can be used in patients with HF who  \n  are on chronic dialysis therapy.\n Ultrafiltration \n  This involves the removal of plasma water across a semi-permeable  \n  membrane in response to a transmembrane pressure gradient.   It may be considered for congestive symptoms refractory to diuresis,  \n  but should be used in consultation with a nephrologist.\n491\n  Evidence for its efficacy in fluid removal is mixed at present.491  Haemodialysis \n  Criteria for possible need to initiate renal replacement therapy include:\n   Oliguria unresponsive to fluid resuscitation.\n   Severe hyperkalaemia (serum potassium > 6.5mmol/L).\n   Severe acidaemia (pH < 7.2). \n   Serum urea > 25mmol/L. \n    Serum creatinine > 300μmol/L. \n8.6  ADVANCED HEART FAILURE/REFRACTORY HEART FAILURE\nThese are patients with severe symptoms of HF despite maximal medical \ntherapy. Hospital admission is necessary for stabilisation. Meticulous control of fluid balance is important. Aggravating causes of HF as listed in Table 5, Page 39 should be identified and treated.\nThese patients may need specialised treatment in CCU or ICU. The following \nmay be required:\n Intravenous infusion of frusemide. These patients may require combination  \n loop diuretics and thiazides.\n Intravenous infusion of inotropes - low dose dobutamine (5mcg/kg/min) or  \n milrinone. These improve symptoms but no survival benefit has been  \n demonstrated.126,492\n Ultrafiltration in patients who are fluid overloaded.493 In most patients,  \n however, the relief is temporary.\nThe prognosis of these patients is poor. They should be referred to assess \nwhether they may be potential candidates for mechanical circulatory support (e.g. LVAD) and consideration for heart transplant.\n8.6.1 HEART TRANSPLANTHeart transplantation is a well-established treatment of refractory end stage \nHF. This definitive therapy for HF however is limited by the lack of donor organs.\n494,495All patients with severe symptomatic HF despite optimal medical therapy and no other alternative therapy option should be considered for heart transplant. They need to be referred to a HF specialist cardiac hospital for further evaluation.\nAssessment for heart transplant is done by a multispeciality, multidisciplinary \nteam and appropriate work up will be performed for eligibility.\nEligibility criteria to be considered for heart transplant include:\n Poor LVEF (< 25%).\n Recurrent HF hospitalisations.\n Major limitation of the patient’s daily activities.\n Poor effort tolerance i.e. peak VO2 (maximal oxygen consumption or  \n peak oxygen uptake) less than 10ml/kg/min (or < 50% predicted). VO2  \n max is the maximum rate of oxygen consumption measured during  \n incremental exercise ie exercise of increasing intensity and is widely  \n used as an indicator of cardiorespiratory fitness.\n Intravenous inotropic dependence for symptomatic relief or to maintain  \n end organ function.\n Motivated, psychologically stable and compliant to therapy.\nContraindications to heart transplant\n Active infection.\n Severe peripheral arterial or cerebrovascular disease.\n Malignancy within 5 years.\n Diabetes mellitus with widespread microvascular complications.\n Systemic disease with multi-organ dysfunction.\n Irreversible chronic kidney, liver or lung disease.\n Pharmacologically irreversible pulmonary hypertension.\n Other medical or psychosocial issues that would impact survival.\n8.6.2 MECHANICAL CIRCULATORY SUPPORT The use of mechanical circulatory support (e.g. LVAD), should be considered \nfor patients with potentially reversible or treatable conditions or as a bridge to heart transplant in suitable candidates.\nLVAD may also be used as destination therapy in candidates who are not \nsuitable for transplant. Patients have improvement in their symptoms when compared to optimal medical therapy.\n496,497 However, the rate of rehospitalisations \ndue to complications of bleeding, thrombosis and infections are high.496-498 \nMany patients also go into major depression. Thus, extensive discussion with the patient and family is necessary prior to LVAD implantation.\nKey message 10:\n Patients with Advanced Heart Failure should be referred to assess  \n whether they may be potential candidates for mechanical circulatory  \n support (e.g. LVAD) and consideration for heart transplant.\n8.7 PALLIATIVE AND END OF LIFE CARE\nDespite recent advances in therapy, for some patients, HF remains a \nprogressive disease and carries a poor prognosis. Patients with refractory symptoms despite guideline-directed medical therapy, should be considered for palliative and end of life care if they have the following characteristics:\n499\n Progressive functional decline (mental and physical) and dependence in  \n most activities of daily living.\n Severe HF symptoms with poor quality of life despite optimal pharmacological \n and non-pharmacological therapies.\n Frequent hospital admissions or serious episodes of decompensation  \n despite optimal therapies.\n Heart transplantation and mechanical circulatory support ruled out.\n Cardiac cachexia.\n Clinically judged to be near end of life.\nThe aim of palliative care in HF is to prevent and relieve suffering and to promote the best quality of life for patients and their families.\n500\nDespite the complexities of end-of-life issues in HF patients, there is minimal evidence-based guidance on the care of this population.\n501 The key components \nof end-of-life care are:\n 1. Advanced care plan with directives and informed decisions on:\n   Use or withdrawal of treatment including advanced therapies such  \n   as V inotropes, ICD and mechanical circulatory support. \n   When it would be appropriate to switch off devices such as ICD or  \n   CRT. \n   Resuscitation status.\n   Preferred location of death (i.e. at home or hospital).\n 2. Symptom management \n  Goals of care at this stage should shift from extending life to controlling \n  symptoms and maximising quality of life. Common symptoms include:\n   Dyspnoea\n   Fatigue\n   Pain\n   Urinary retention \n  Constipation\n  Cachexia\n  Depression\n Medications that may be useful include analgesics, antiemetics, anxiolytics,  \n opioids, laxatives, and diuretics, etc. \n3. Psychosocial support\n The impact of HF on quality of life for the patient and family is complex and  \n extends beyond physical symptoms.502\n Emotional, spiritual and social support should be provided to alleviate patient  \n anxiety about dying, and to guide patient towards a peaceful journey at the end  \n of life.\n9.1 LEVEL OF CARE AND SHARED MANAGEMENT \nThe care of patients with HF should ideally take place in a multidisciplinary system, \nallowing for shared care between the hospital (secondary or tertiary settings) and \ncommunity (primary setting). A multidisciplinary approach encompasses patient \neducation, cardiac rehabilitation, psychosocial support and palliative care, and has been proven to reduce HF hospitalisations and mortality in discharged patients.\n503-505\nThe multidisciplinary team usually consists of cardiologists and or general physicians, HF nurses, pharmacists, dieticians, physiotherapists, primary care \nproviders, social workers as well as geriatricians, psychologists, occupational \ntherapists and when necessary, palliative care specialists. Care can be done in two different settings: \n In the patient’s own home - home-based interventions are associated with  \n significantly lower healthcare costs, reduced hospital readmissions and an  \n improvement in the patient’s quality of life.506 This may however, not be feasible  \n in our local setting.\n Specialist outpatient clinic - the Heart Failure Clinic (HFC). \nHFCs can either be:\n Nurse-directed - these are run by nurses with special training in HF.\n Physician-directed - run by general physicians and/or cardiologists. \nHFCs can be established in the tertiary hospitals or in the primary care setting. The minimum human resource requirements are a:\n Cardiologist or general physician with an interest in cardiology and HF, \n Dedicated nurse and \n Medical technologist for blood taking, doing echocardiography and 6 minutes \n walk tests.In bigger clinic settings, the involvement of physiotherapists to encourage physical \nactivity, pharmacists and counsellors for end of life care would be advisable.\nThese clinics will be the intermediary between in-patient hospital care and community \nprimary care. Patients who can be seen in these clinics include those:507\n Recently discharged after an admission for decompensated HF (a waiting \n time of 7-12 days post discharge has to be the maximum wait-time).\n Who are in the early decompensation phase and need treatment modification.\n Who are stable but need uptitration of HF medications.\n With ICD or CRTs. \n With comorbidities, such as renal dysfunction, diabetes and COPD.\n With advanced HF who may benefit from:\n  Heart transplant\n  Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD)\n  Palliative care.\nThe objectives of these HF clinics may vary based on local settings. These include:\n507,508\n Optimisation of medical therapy particularly the uptitration of β-blockers, ACE-I  \n and MRA. \n Education of the patient and caregiver on the nature of the disease and its  \n progression. \n Promotion of self-care such as :\n  Compliance to medical therapy and fluid restriction.\n  Regular weighing and adjusting diuretic doses according to symptoms and  \n  body weight.\nPatient with optimised HF medications/treatment plans can be discharged to the \ncommunity with appropriate care plans to primary care. Close partnership between these HF clinics and primary care helps to reduce unnecessary admissions to hospital. \nIn 2018, the Heart Failure Medication Therapy Adherence Clinic (MTAC) was \nintroduced. These clinics are conducted by pharmacists in collaboration with doctors and other healthcare providers to improve HF management. The objectives of the Heart Failure MTAC are:\n509\n Enhance patient’s adherence to HF pharmacotherapy and non-pharmacological  \n interventions.\n To reduce unscheduled emergency department visits or hospitalisations of HF  \n patient due to acute decompensation.\n To provide consultative service to doctors on evidence-based HF pharmacotherapy  \n and related issues.\n To collaborate with doctors and other health care professionals in HF management  \n program.9.2 MONITORING AND FOLLOW-UP \nPatients with HF require regular follow-up and monitoring. Serial evaluations serve \nto assess a patient’s status, response to therapy, development of complications and disease progression. Key components of assessment include:\n Functional capacity - NYHA functional class or 6-minute walk test \n Fluid status and body weight \n Blood pressure, heart rate and rhythm \n Examination of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems\n Cognitive status and nutritional status \n Review of pharmacotherapy - uptitration, compliance and side effects\n Serum urea, electrolytes, creatinine and eGFR as necessary\n Diet and sodium intake\n Consumption of alcohol or illicit drugs\n Smoking history.\nThe frequency of follow-up will depend on the patient’s clinical stability and need for pharmacotherapy optimisation. A patient with a recent episode of decompensation or clinical instability, for instance, should ideally be seen again soon, usually within 2 weeks. Ultimately, the intensity and type of follow-up would be determined by the local organisation of care and resources.\nRoutine serial echocardiogram is not recommended. However, if there has been a \nrecent change in clinical status or if the patient has received treatment that might significantly change certain echocardiographic parameters, a follow-up echocardiogram is reasonable to assess the LVEF and structural remodeling.\nSerial brain natriuretic peptide measurements to guide and tailor HF therapy cannot \nbe broadly recommended at the present time due to a lack of consistent evidence.\n29-32 \n9.3 CARDIOLOGY REFERRAL \nHF patients with stable symptoms may be managed at the primary care level. \nReferral to the cardiologist should be considered in the following situations: \n De novo HF for a comprehensive workup to confirm the diagnosis and determine  \n the aetiology, and to devise a management plan.\n Episodes of acute decompensation.\n Worsening HF symptoms despite appropriate therapy. \n HF complicated with symptomatic hypotension or excessive bradycardia, limiting \n uptitration of pharmacotherapy. Symptomatic stable CAD and/or acute coronary syndrome for consideration of  \n revascularisation (PCI or CABG). \n Resuscitated cardiac arrest.\n Documented or suspected significant arrhythmias e.g. AF, VT.\n Significant valvular disease not previously assessed or worsening valvular  \n dysfunction.\n Pre-conception assessment and counselling of women with significant structural  \n heart disease and a past history of HF or LV dysfunction. \n Complex congenital cardiac lesions and/or Eisenmenger’s syndrome.\nDespite taking conventional HF therapy, patients may seek alternative therapy and healing approaches that are not considered as allopathic medicine. The National Centre for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) defines complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) as a group of diverse medical and healthcare interventions, practices, products or disciplines that are not generally considered part of conventional medicine.\n10.1 Enhanced External Counter Pulsation (EECP)\nThere is inadequate evidence of clinical effectiveness of EECP in HF.\n510-513 There is \nconcern that it could precipitate or exacerbate HF. \n10.2 Stem cell therapy\nA global position paper on cardiovascular regenerative medicine stated that \ncell-based therapy in HF patients is neither positive nor consistent.514 \n10.3 Omega 3 fatty acids\nIn patients with HFrEF, it may be considered as an adjunctive therapy based on a \nsingle randomised controlled trial (RCT) which showed a small benefit in CV death and/or hospitalisations.\n515,516 10.4 Coenzyme Q10\nThere is no convincing evidence to support or refute the use of coenzyme Q10 for \npatients with HF.517\n10.5 Tai Chi\nTai Chi may improve 6 min walk test distance, quality of life and LVEF in patients with \nHF.518,519 Its effect on hard CV outcomes such as rehospitalisation, MI and mortality \nis not known. \n10.6 YogaA meta-analysis in 2014 that includes two RCTs concluded that yoga improved peak \nVO2 (exercise capacity) and quality of life in chronic HF patients.\n520 There is an \nongoing RCT to look at the effect of yoga in HFpEF patients.521\nThe focus of future development for HF in Malaysia should be towards service \nenhancement working to meet the World Heart Federation mandate of a 25% reduction in premature non-communicable disease mortality by 2025. \nFinding the balance between costs and quality remains a global challenge, and the \nunderstanding of the disease in our healthcare context is imperative to making sure we move forward regarding service delivery, human resource allocation, medical expense costs and patient outcomes. To achieve this, the following need to be undertaken: \n Epidemiological studies to understand the disease profile in the country.\n Establishment and expansion of HFCs leading to more patient-centred HF care.\n Expanding service delivery, human resource allocation, medical expense cost  \n and patient outcomes.\n Education of healthcare personnel.\nEfforts should be directed to the knowledge and understanding of the epidemiology of HF in our country, its phenotype, presentation, current adherence to guideline-directed therapy and outcomes. Regular cluster sampling cohorts or a nationwide registry should be considered. Understanding the limitations of service delivery albeit geography or human resources and making plans for better service delivery systems \nare important.\nDevelopment of HFCs, can lead to a more patient-centric HF care. (See Section 9, Pages 110-113)\nModules for HF care need to be initiated in order to train and educate general \ninternal medicine physicians. A core-curriculum for education needs to be formed to ensure adequate training has been disseminated to HFC personnel.   \nIncentives regarding HF guidelines compliance should be implemented and HF \ninnovative practice should be encouraged with awards for best clinical practice and innovation be made available. \nThis streamline approach to HF care with engagement of connected groups hopefully \nwill help in better overall patient care and experience.\nPerformance measures should be used with the goal of improving quality of care for HF.\n518,519\nProcess performance measures focus on the aspects of care that are delivered to a patient, \nwhile outcome measures focus on the end-points such as mortality or hospitalisation.\nProcess performance indicators for in-patients with HF includes:522-524\n % of patients who had documentation of NYHA Functional Class.\n % of patients who had LVEF measurement.\n % of patients with current or prior LVEF < 40% and without contraindications  \n discharged with ACE-I/ARB. \n % of patients with current or prior LVEF < 40% and without contraindications  \n discharged on β-blockers.\n % of patients with current or prior LVEF < 40% and without contraindications  \n discharged on MRA.\n % of patients with chronic or paroxysmal AF/atrial flutter without contraindications  \n on anticoagulant therapy at discharge.\n % of patients given a post discharge appointment.\nThe accepted performance measure should be more than 60%.Outcome measures indicators include:\n In-hospital mortality\n 30-day readmission for HF\nRefer to Appendix VI, Page 121 for calculation of these measures."

        "text": "1108.5.5 CARDIO-ONCOLOGY AND HEART FAILURE\nHeart disease and cancer are often linked due to:\n Common risk factors (e.g. increasing age and cigarette smoking)\n Treatment strategies \n  Chemotherapy drugs has been associated with HF, arrhythmias,  \n  vasculitis and thromboembolic disease.\n  Radiotherapy of the mediastinum and left chest can lead to CAD,  \n  myopericardial fibrosis and valvular dysfunction.\nDyspnoea in cancer patients could be due to:\n Fluid overload.\n Cardiomyopathy due to chemotherapeutic agents, stress (Takotsubo), or  \n underlying CAD.\n The primary cancer causing anaemia, lung and pericardial involvement. \nChemotherapy-induced cardiomyopathy is not common, clinical HF occurs in \n1-5% and an asymptomatic decrease in LV function in the range of 5% to 20%.\n442 Prognosis in the patients who develop HF is poor.443\nThe anthracycline class of chemotherapeutic agents remain the major cause of chemotherapy-induced cardiomyopathy.\n444,445 In the current era, newer \nagents have also been implicated in a reversible form of cardiomyopathy.446 \nChemotherapy-induced cardiomyopathy as defined by the Cardiac Review and Evaluation Committee is the presence of at least one or more of the following:\n447\n1. Cardiomyopathy characterised by a decrease in Ejection Fraction (EF)  \n globally or due to regional changes in interventricular septum contraction. \n2. Symptoms of HF.3. Signs associated with HF including but not limited to S3 gallop, tachycardia,  \n or both.4. Decline in initial EF of at least 5% to < 55% with signs and symptoms of  \n HF or asymptomatic decrease in EF of at least 10% to < 55%.Chemotherapy drugs that have been associated with HF include (Appendix V, Page120):\n Doxorubicin \n  5% at a cumulative dose of 400mg/m2 (the higher the cumulative dose, \n  the greater the risk of HF.445  \n  Even at lower doses of 180 to 240mg/m2, subclinical events can  \n  occur in up to 30% of patients about 13 years post treatment.448\n  These suggest that there is no ‘safe’ dose for doxorubicin. \n Cyclophosphamide especially in high doses and ifosfomide.449,450  \n Newer agents such as monoclonal antibodies (trastuzumab and pertuzumab), \n small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (imatinib, sunitinib, sorafenib)  \n and the proteasome inhibitor (bortezomib).  Trastuzumab especially when administered together with anthracyclines \n  and cyclophosphamide, has been associated with an increased incidence \n  of HF of 27% compared to 1.7% to 4.1% when anthracycline was not part  \n  of the therapeutic regimen.\n451-453 Symptoms are usually mild to moderate \n  and improve following medical management and termination of drug  \n  administration. Improvement is usually seen in about 4-6 weeks after    withdrawal of the agent.\n454-456 After symptomatic improvement, \n  reinstitution  of treatment is usually possible.454-456\n  Vascular endothelial growth factor signaling pathway (VSP) inhibitors  \n  (bevacizumab) can cause hypertension. Bevacizumab also blocks  \n  receptors that are involved in the compensatory response to stress in  \n  the cardiomyocytes and when the heart is unable to compensate for  \n  the hypertension, it could lead to HF.457,458 Maintaining good blood pressure \n  control can prevent HF associated with this agent. Heart failure due to  \n  VSP inhibitors is usually reversible with cessation of the agent.459\nOne must consider both the efficacy and the toxicity in choosing chemotherapeutic agents. Many of the newer targeted agents cause a reversible form of HF and symptoms usually resolve after the initiation of anti-failure medications.\n454-456,459,460 \nRisk factors for anthracycline toxicity include: 461-465\n The total cumulative dose\n Intravenous bolus administration versus infusion\n Higher single doses\n History of prior irradiation\n Use of concomitant agents known to have cardiotoxicity\n Female gender\n Underlying CV disease\n Age (young and elderly)\n An increase in cardiac biomarkers such as troponins during and   after administration is an indication of toxicity.8.5.5.1 Management\n Patients undergoing chemotherapy should have a careful clinical evaluation \n and assessment and treatment of CV risk factors.464,465\n Blood pressure control is important in all patients especially in those  \n being considered for VSP inhibitors.\n All patients with potential cardiotoxic chemotherapy should have an  \n echocardiogram prior to treatment. An important parameter is the LVEF  \n determined using the biplane method of discs (Simpson’s method) or  \n three-dimensional echocardiography where available. Newer techniques   to detect and quantitate regional and global myocardial dysfunction  \n (strain assessment with global longitudinal strain) can be used to detect  \n pre-clinical and subtle changes in function.\n466-469 \n Biomarkers such as troponin and natriuretic peptides can help identify  \n patients at higher risk.462,463,470,471 \nClose collaboration between the oncologist and the cardiologist is important. \nFor the oncologists, the strategy (prior to commencement) includes:465\n Identifying high risk patients (pre-existing heart disease, presence of  \n CV risk factors, age - young and old, female gender, use of high dose  \n anthracycline regimens).\n High risk patients should:\n  Have a pre-treatment cardiac function evaluation. If the LVEF is < 50%,  \n  refer to the cardiologist.  Be considered for non-cardiotoxic alternatives. \n  Have their therapy protocols adjusted where necessary (e.g. reduction \n  in doses, continuous infusions rather than bolus injections, liposomal    doxorubicin, dexrazoxane etc). \nFor the cardiologists/general physicians, the strategy includes:\n Treating CV risk factors. \n Assessing, repeating (if necessary) imaging studies. (e.g. using high  \n quality LVEF measurement, strain evaluation etc).\n Assessing cardiac biomarkers (troponin and/or NP).\n Considering cardio-protection prior to/or during treatment using β-blockers,  \n MRA and/or ACE-I/ARB if:69,465,472-474\n  EF < 50%, \n  EF drops by > 10%\n  Abnormal global longitudinal strain (GLS) (> 15% drop).  Monitoring LVEF during therapy is important with repeat echocardiography  \n at 3-monthly intervals and/or according to symptoms. If cardioprotective  \n medications are given, monitoring may be necessary at closer intervals of  \n time depending on the clinical condition of the patient e.g. 1-monthly interval. \n Withholding cardiotoxic therapy only as a last resort. (for anthracycline  \n LVEF < 45%, for anti-HER2 therapy LVEF < 40%).\n Monitoring even after completion of therapy:\n  Obtain post therapy LVEF.\n  Repeat echocardiography in 6 months or 1 year. Most cases of  \n  treatment-associated cardiac dysfunction develop within the first year  \n  after completion of therapy.475,476 \n  If EF remains abnormal, follow guidelines for management of HF.465 \n \n8.5.6 HEART FAILURE AND KIDNEY DYSFUNCTION\n8.5.6.1 Epidemiology, definitions and classifications Cardiac and pre-existing kidney disease at admission frequently co-exist, \nvarying from 45.4% in patients with chronic HF to > 60% in those with AHF.\n477,478 \nIn addition, during treatment of AHF, a significant proportion of patients will develop varying degrees of worsening renal function (WRF).\nThe definition of WRF is:\n479\n An increase in serum creatinine by ≥ 26.5μmol/ L (0.3mg/dl) and/or\n A ≥ 25% increase in serum creatinine or a ≥ 20% drop in eGFR.\nThe rise in serum creatinine usually occurs in the first three to five days of \nhospitalisation. The incidence of WRF is estimated to be between 19 and 45%.165 This large \nobserved range is due to variations in the definitions of WRF, the observed time-at-risk and the study population.\n165 \nRisk factors for WRF during admission for HF include:480\n A prior history of HF or diabetes, \n An admission serum creatinine of > 133μmol/L,  or \n Systolic blood pressure > 160mmHg. \nWRF may fulfill criteria for type 1 or type 2 cardiorenal syndrome (CRS). The term “cardiorenal syndrome” refers to disorders of the heart and kidneys whereby acute or chronic dysfunction in one organ may induce acute or chronic dysfunction of the other.\n165 \nThis syndrome has been classified by the Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative working group into 5 subtypes as shown in Table 17, Page 105.\n165 Many \npatients however, may belong to more than one subtype and may move between subtypes during the course of their disease.\n165\n8.5.6.2. Pathogenesis of CRS \nMultiple mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of CRS. These include:\n Increased renal venous pressure  - venous congestion is probably the  \n most important factor.481 \n RV dysfunction.\n Reduced renal perfusion with reduced cardiac output. \n Neurohumoral adaptations (e.g. activation of the sympathetic nervous  \n system and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, increases in  \n vasopressin and endothelin-1).8.5.6.3  Clinical significance /Impact of kidney dysfunction in HF  The combination of cardiac and kidney disease increases the complexity and \ncosts of care, and may interact to worsen prognosis. \nA. Pharmacologic considerations \n Safety:\n  Dosing of renally-excreted cardiac drugs need adjustment in the  \n  presence of renal impairment (e.g. digoxin, insulin, low molecular  \n  weight heparin).\n  Patients with HF are at increased risk of contrast-induced acute kidney \n  injury. \n Efficacy:\n  Impaired renal function will affect drug choices and dosing. If eGFR <  \n  30mls/min/1.73m2, most thiazide diuretics are no longer effective and  \n  loop diuretics are preferred. Higher doses of loop diuretics may be   \n  required with increasing renal impairment.             B. Prognostic implications\n Preexisting CKD is a bad prognostic indicator in patients with HF - the  \n more severe the CKD, the worse the mortality.482,483\n In patients with HF, WRF may not always indicate a poor outcome.484 The  \n prognostic value of WRF is mainly determined by:   The presence of persistent congestion  \n  Baseline renal function and magnitude of renal changes \n  Duration - persistent WRF is usually associated with hemodynamic  \n  derangements and poor prognosis as compared with transient WRF  \n  as a result of agressive decongestive therapy.485-487\nTable 17: Classification of Cardiorenal Syndrome (CRS)8.5.6.4. Management \n A multi-disciplinary approach is recommended. Early referral to a  \n nephrologist is advisable.   \n Exclude potentially reversible causes for increasing renal dysfunction  \n such as hyper - or hypovolaemia, concomitant medications such as  \n aminoglycosides and NSAIDs, ACE-I or ARB and renal artery stenosis. \n Closely monitor electrolytes and kidney function, especially during acute  \n illnesses, dehydration and when increasing doses of cardiac drugs  \n including diuretics. The baseline renal function will determine how frequently \n this should be done. \n The recommended range for serum potassium is 4-5.5mmol/L.488 \n Wherever possible, avoid nephrotoxins, e.g. contrast media for angiography\n Intravenous diuretics \n  Loop diuretics are the first choice.\n  Continuous infusion may not have greater benefits compared with  \n  bolus dosing.115-118,489\n  Start initially with 2-2.5 times the usual oral dose. \n  Combination therapy (loop diuretic and thiazide/thiazide-like diuretic/\n  mineralocorticoid) may be required to enhance diuresis.205-207 However,  \n  care is required to avoid electrolyte disturbances, hypovolaemia and  \n  worsening renal dysfunction. \n Careful use of Renin Angiotensin System (RAS) blockers  \n  HF patients with stable, chronic mild-moderate renal insufficiency  \n  (eGFR > 30mls/min/1.73m2) should receive standard therapy with an  \n  ACE-I/ ARB and an MRA.490\n  A serum creatinine rise or GFR decrease by up to 30% from baseline  \n  may be acceptable before it becomes necessary to consider stopping  \n  or decreasing doses.221 \n  In patients with advanced renal failure, the decision to start or stop  \n  RAS blockers should be individualised.490\n  Consider withholding RAS blockers during aggressive diuresis in  \n  patients at high risk for WRF.  RAS blockers (and β-blockers) can be used in patients with HF who  \n  are on chronic dialysis therapy.\n Ultrafiltration \n  This involves the removal of plasma water across a semi-permeable  \n  membrane in response to a transmembrane pressure gradient.   It may be considered for congestive symptoms refractory to diuresis,  \n  but should be used in consultation with a nephrologist.\n491\n  Evidence for its efficacy in fluid removal is mixed at present.491  Haemodialysis \n  Criteria for possible need to initiate renal replacement therapy include:\n   Oliguria unresponsive to fluid resuscitation.\n   Severe hyperkalaemia (serum potassium > 6.5mmol/L).\n   Severe acidaemia (pH < 7.2). \n   Serum urea > 25mmol/L. \n    Serum creatinine > 300μmol/L. \n8.6  ADVANCED HEART FAILURE/REFRACTORY HEART FAILURE\nThese are patients with severe symptoms of HF despite maximal medical \ntherapy. Hospital admission is necessary for stabilisation. Meticulous control of fluid balance is important. Aggravating causes of HF as listed in Table 5, Page 39 should be identified and treated.\nThese patients may need specialised treatment in CCU or ICU. The following \nmay be required:\n Intravenous infusion of frusemide. These patients may require combination  \n loop diuretics and thiazides.\n Intravenous infusion of inotropes - low dose dobutamine (5mcg/kg/min) or  \n milrinone. These improve symptoms but no survival benefit has been  \n demonstrated.126,492\n Ultrafiltration in patients who are fluid overloaded.493 In most patients,  \n however, the relief is temporary.\nThe prognosis of these patients is poor. They should be referred to assess \nwhether they may be potential candidates for mechanical circulatory support (e.g. LVAD) and consideration for heart transplant.\n8.6.1 HEART TRANSPLANTHeart transplantation is a well-established treatment of refractory end stage \nHF. This definitive therapy for HF however is limited by the lack of donor organs.\n494,495All patients with severe symptomatic HF despite optimal medical therapy and no other alternative therapy option should be considered for heart transplant. They need to be referred to a HF specialist cardiac hospital for further evaluation.\nAssessment for heart transplant is done by a multispeciality, multidisciplinary \nteam and appropriate work up will be performed for eligibility.\nEligibility criteria to be considered for heart transplant include:\n Poor LVEF (< 25%).\n Recurrent HF hospitalisations.\n Major limitation of the patient’s daily activities.\n Poor effort tolerance i.e. peak VO2 (maximal oxygen consumption or  \n peak oxygen uptake) less than 10ml/kg/min (or < 50% predicted). VO2  \n max is the maximum rate of oxygen consumption measured during  \n incremental exercise ie exercise of increasing intensity and is widely  \n used as an indicator of cardiorespiratory fitness.\n Intravenous inotropic dependence for symptomatic relief or to maintain  \n end organ function.\n Motivated, psychologically stable and compliant to therapy.\nContraindications to heart transplant\n Active infection.\n Severe peripheral arterial or cerebrovascular disease.\n Malignancy within 5 years.\n Diabetes mellitus with widespread microvascular complications.\n Systemic disease with multi-organ dysfunction.\n Irreversible chronic kidney, liver or lung disease.\n Pharmacologically irreversible pulmonary hypertension.\n Other medical or psychosocial issues that would impact survival.\n8.6.2 MECHANICAL CIRCULATORY SUPPORT The use of mechanical circulatory support (e.g. LVAD), should be considered \nfor patients with potentially reversible or treatable conditions or as a bridge to heart transplant in suitable candidates.\nLVAD may also be used as destination therapy in candidates who are not \nsuitable for transplant. Patients have improvement in their symptoms when compared to optimal medical therapy.\n496,497 However, the rate of rehospitalisations \ndue to complications of bleeding, thrombosis and infections are high.496-498 \nMany patients also go into major depression. Thus, extensive discussion with the patient and family is necessary prior to LVAD implantation.8.7 PALLIATIVE AND END OF LIFE CARE\nDespite recent advances in therapy, for some patients, HF remains a \nprogressive disease and carries a poor prognosis. Patients with refractory symptoms despite guideline-directed medical therapy, should be considered for palliative and end of life care if they have the following characteristics:\n499\n Progressive functional decline (mental and physical) and dependence in  \n most activities of daily living.\n Severe HF symptoms with poor quality of life despite optimal pharmacological \n and non-pharmacological therapies.\n Frequent hospital admissions or serious episodes of decompensation  \n despite optimal therapies.\n Heart transplantation and mechanical circulatory support ruled out.\n Cardiac cachexia.\n Clinically judged to be near end of life.\nThe aim of palliative care in HF is to prevent and relieve suffering and to promote the best quality of life for patients and their families.\n500\nDespite the complexities of end-of-life issues in HF patients, there is minimal evidence-based guidance on the care of this population.\n501 The key components \nof end-of-life care are:\n 1. Advanced care plan with directives and informed decisions on:\n   Use or withdrawal of treatment including advanced therapies such  \n   as V inotropes, ICD and mechanical circulatory support. \n   When it would be appropriate to switch off devices such as ICD or  \n   CRT. \n   Resuscitation status.\n   Preferred location of death (i.e. at home or hospital).\n 2. Symptom management \n  Goals of care at this stage should shift from extending life to controlling \n  symptoms and maximising quality of life. Common symptoms include:\n   Dyspnoea\n   Fatigue\n   Pain\n   Urinary retention \n  Constipation\n  Cachexia\n  Depression\n Medications that may be useful include analgesics, antiemetics, anxiolytics,  \n opioids, laxatives, and diuretics, etc. \n3. Psychosocial support\n The impact of HF on quality of life for the patient and family is complex and  \n extends beyond physical symptoms.502\n Emotional, spiritual and social support should be provided to alleviate patient  \n anxiety about dying, and to guide patient towards a peaceful journey at the end  \n of life.\n9.1 LEVEL OF CARE AND SHARED MANAGEMENT \nThe care of patients with HF should ideally take place in a multidisciplinary system, \nallowing for shared care between the hospital (secondary or tertiary settings) and \ncommunity (primary setting). A multidisciplinary approach encompasses patient \neducation, cardiac rehabilitation, psychosocial support and palliative care, and has been proven to reduce HF hospitalisations and mortality in discharged patients.\n503-505\nThe multidisciplinary team usually consists of cardiologists and or general physicians, HF nurses, pharmacists, dieticians, physiotherapists, primary care \nproviders, social workers as well as geriatricians, psychologists, occupational \ntherapists and when necessary, palliative care specialists. Care can be done in two different settings: \n In the patient’s own home - home-based interventions are associated with  \n significantly lower healthcare costs, reduced hospital readmissions and an  \n improvement in the patient’s quality of life.506 This may however, not be feasible  \n in our local setting.\n Specialist outpatient clinic - the Heart Failure Clinic (HFC). \nHFCs can either be:\n Nurse-directed - these are run by nurses with special training in HF.\n Physician-directed - run by general physicians and/or cardiologists. \nHFCs can be established in the tertiary hospitals or in the primary care setting. The minimum human resource requirements are a:\n Cardiologist or general physician with an interest in cardiology and HF, \n Dedicated nurse and \n Medical technologist for blood taking, doing echocardiography and 6 minutes \n walk tests.In bigger clinic settings, the involvement of physiotherapists to encourage physical \nactivity, pharmacists and counsellors for end of life care would be advisable.\nThese clinics will be the intermediary between in-patient hospital care and community \nprimary care. Patients who can be seen in these clinics include those:507\n Recently discharged after an admission for decompensated HF (a waiting \n time of 7-12 days post discharge has to be the maximum wait-time).\n Who are in the early decompensation phase and need treatment modification.\n Who are stable but need uptitration of HF medications.\n With ICD or CRTs. \n With comorbidities, such as renal dysfunction, diabetes and COPD.\n With advanced HF who may benefit from:\n  Heart transplant\n  Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD)\n  Palliative care.\nThe objectives of these HF clinics may vary based on local settings. These include:\n507,508\n Optimisation of medical therapy particularly the uptitration of β-blockers, ACE-I  \n and MRA. \n Education of the patient and caregiver on the nature of the disease and its  \n progression. \n Promotion of self-care such as :\n  Compliance to medical therapy and fluid restriction.\n  Regular weighing and adjusting diuretic doses according to symptoms and  \n  body weight.\nPatient with optimised HF medications/treatment plans can be discharged to the \ncommunity with appropriate care plans to primary care. Close partnership between these HF clinics and primary care helps to reduce unnecessary admissions to hospital. \nIn 2018, the Heart Failure Medication Therapy Adherence Clinic (MTAC) was \nintroduced. These clinics are conducted by pharmacists in collaboration with doctors and other healthcare providers to improve HF management. The objectives of the Heart Failure MTAC are:\n509\n Enhance patient’s adherence to HF pharmacotherapy and non-pharmacological  \n interventions.\n To reduce unscheduled emergency department visits or hospitalisations of HF  \n patient due to acute decompensation.\n To provide consultative service to doctors on evidence-based HF pharmacotherapy  \n and related issues.\n To collaborate with doctors and other health care professionals in HF management  \n program.9.2 MONITORING AND FOLLOW-UP \nPatients with HF require regular follow-up and monitoring. Serial evaluations serve \nto assess a patient’s status, response to therapy, development of complications and disease progression. Key components of assessment include:\n Functional capacity - NYHA functional class or 6-minute walk test \n Fluid status and body weight \n Blood pressure, heart rate and rhythm \n Examination of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems\n Cognitive status and nutritional status \n Review of pharmacotherapy - uptitration, compliance and side effects\n Serum urea, electrolytes, creatinine and eGFR as necessary\n Diet and sodium intake\n Consumption of alcohol or illicit drugs\n Smoking history.\nThe frequency of follow-up will depend on the patient’s clinical stability and need for pharmacotherapy optimisation. A patient with a recent episode of decompensation or clinical instability, for instance, should ideally be seen again soon, usually within 2 weeks. Ultimately, the intensity and type of follow-up would be determined by the local organisation of care and resources.\nRoutine serial echocardiogram is not recommended. However, if there has been a \nrecent change in clinical status or if the patient has received treatment that might significantly change certain echocardiographic parameters, a follow-up echocardiogram is reasonable to assess the LVEF and structural remodeling.\nSerial brain natriuretic peptide measurements to guide and tailor HF therapy cannot \nbe broadly recommended at the present time due to a lack of consistent evidence.\n29-32 \n9.3 CARDIOLOGY REFERRAL \nHF patients with stable symptoms may be managed at the primary care level. \nReferral to the cardiologist should be considered in the following situations: \n De novo HF for a comprehensive workup to confirm the diagnosis and determine  \n the aetiology, and to devise a management plan.\n Episodes of acute decompensation.\n Worsening HF symptoms despite appropriate therapy. \n HF complicated with symptomatic hypotension or excessive bradycardia, limiting \n uptitration of pharmacotherapy. Symptomatic stable CAD and/or acute coronary syndrome for consideration of  \n revascularisation (PCI or CABG). \n Resuscitated cardiac arrest.\n Documented or suspected significant arrhythmias e.g. AF, VT.\n Significant valvular disease not previously assessed or worsening valvular  \n dysfunction.\n Pre-conception assessment and counselling of women with significant structural  \n heart disease and a past history of HF or LV dysfunction. \n Complex congenital cardiac lesions and/or Eisenmenger’s syndrome.\nDespite taking conventional HF therapy, patients may seek alternative therapy and healing approaches that are not considered as allopathic medicine. The National Centre for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) defines complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) as a group of diverse medical and healthcare interventions, practices, products or disciplines that are not generally considered part of conventional medicine.\n10.1 Enhanced External Counter Pulsation (EECP)\nThere is inadequate evidence of clinical effectiveness of EECP in HF.\n510-513 There is \nconcern that it could precipitate or exacerbate HF. \n10.2 Stem cell therapy\nA global position paper on cardiovascular regenerative medicine stated that \ncell-based therapy in HF patients is neither positive nor consistent.514 \n10.3 Omega 3 fatty acids\nIn patients with HFrEF, it may be considered as an adjunctive therapy based on a \nsingle randomised controlled trial (RCT) which showed a small benefit in CV death and/or hospitalisations.\n515,516 10.4 Coenzyme Q10\nThere is no convincing evidence to support or refute the use of coenzyme Q10 for \npatients with HF.517\n10.5 Tai Chi\nTai Chi may improve 6 min walk test distance, quality of life and LVEF in patients with \nHF.518,519 Its effect on hard CV outcomes such as rehospitalisation, MI and mortality \nis not known. \n10.6 YogaA meta-analysis in 2014 that includes two RCTs concluded that yoga improved peak \nVO2 (exercise capacity) and quality of life in chronic HF patients.\n520 There is an \nongoing RCT to look at the effect of yoga in HFpEF patients.521\nThe focus of future development for HF in Malaysia should be towards service \nenhancement working to meet the World Heart Federation mandate of a 25% reduction in premature non-communicable disease mortality by 2025. \nFinding the balance between costs and quality remains a global challenge, and the \nunderstanding of the disease in our healthcare context is imperative to making sure we move forward regarding service delivery, human resource allocation, medical expense costs and patient outcomes. To achieve this, the following need to be undertaken: \n Epidemiological studies to understand the disease profile in the country.\n Establishment and expansion of HFCs leading to more patient-centred HF care.\n Expanding service delivery, human resource allocation, medical expense cost  \n and patient outcomes.\n Education of healthcare personnel.\nEfforts should be directed to the knowledge and understanding of the epidemiology of HF in our country, its phenotype, presentation, current adherence to guideline-directed therapy and outcomes. Regular cluster sampling cohorts or a nationwide registry should be considered. Understanding the limitations of service delivery albeit geography or human resources and making plans for better service delivery systems \nare important.\nDevelopment of HFCs, can lead to a more patient-centric HF care. (See Section 9, Pages 110-113)\nModules for HF care need to be initiated in order to train and educate general \ninternal medicine physicians. A core-curriculum for education needs to be formed to ensure adequate training has been disseminated to HFC personnel.   \nIncentives regarding HF guidelines compliance should be implemented and HF \ninnovative practice should be encouraged with awards for best clinical practice and innovation be made available. \nThis streamline approach to HF care with engagement of connected groups hopefully \nwill help in better overall patient care and experience.\nPerformance measures should be used with the goal of improving quality of care for HF.\n518,519\nProcess performance measures focus on the aspects of care that are delivered to a patient, \nwhile outcome measures focus on the end-points such as mortality or hospitalisation.\nProcess performance indicators for in-patients with HF includes:522-524\n % of patients who had documentation of NYHA Functional Class.\n % of patients who had LVEF measurement.\n % of patients with current or prior LVEF < 40% and without contraindications  \n discharged with ACE-I/ARB. \n % of patients with current or prior LVEF < 40% and without contraindications  \n discharged on β-blockers.\n % of patients with current or prior LVEF < 40% and without contraindications  \n discharged on MRA.\n % of patients with chronic or paroxysmal AF/atrial flutter without contraindications  \n on anticoagulant therapy at discharge.\n % of patients given a post discharge appointment.\nThe accepted performance measure should be more than 60%.Outcome measures indicators include:\n In-hospital mortality\n 30-day readmission for HF\nRefer to Appendix VI, Page 121 for calculation of these measures.\n9.

Cardiomyopathy characterised by a decrease in Ejection Fraction (EF)  \n globally or due to regional changes in interventricular septum contraction. \n2. Symptoms of HF.3. Signs associated with HF including but not limited to S3 gallop, tachycardia,  \n or both.4. Decline in initial EF of at least 5% to < 55% with signs and symptoms of  \n HF or asymptomatic decrease in EF of at least 10% to < 55%.Chemotherapy drugs that have been associated with HF include (Appendix V, Page120):\n Doxorubicin \n  5% at a cumulative dose of 400mg/m2 (the higher the cumulative dose, \n  the greater the risk of HF.445  \n  Even at lower doses of 180 to 240mg/m2, subclinical events can  \n  occur in up to 30% of patients about 13 years post treatment.448\n  These suggest that there is no ‘safe’ dose for doxorubicin. \n Cyclophosphamide especially in high doses and ifosfomide.449,450  \n Newer agents such as monoclonal antibodies (trastuzumab and pertuzumab), \n small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (imatinib, sunitinib, sorafenib)  \n and the proteasome inhibitor (bortezomib).  Trastuzumab especially when administered together with anthracyclines \n  and cyclophosphamide, has been associated with an increased incidence \n  of HF of 27% compared to 1.7% to 4.1% when anthracycline was not part  \n  of the therapeutic regimen.\n451-453 Symptoms are usually mild to moderate \n  and improve following medical management and termination of drug  \n  administration. Improvement is usually seen in about 4-6 weeks after    withdrawal of the agent.\n454-456 After symptomatic improvement, \n  reinstitution  of treatment is usually possible.454-456\n  Vascular endothelial growth factor signaling pathway (VSP) inhibitors  \n  (bevacizumab) can cause hypertension. Bevacizumab also blocks  \n  receptors that are involved in the compensatory response to stress in  \n  the cardiomyocytes and when the heart is unable to compensate for  \n  the hypertension, it could lead to HF.457,458 Maintaining good blood pressure \n  control can prevent HF associated with this agent. Heart failure due to  \n  VSP inhibitors is usually reversible with cessation of the agent.459\nOne must consider both the efficacy and the toxicity in choosing chemotherapeutic agents. Many of the newer targeted agents cause a reversible form of HF and symptoms usually resolve after the initiation of anti-failure medications.\n454-456,459,460 \nRisk factors for anthracycline toxicity include: 461-465\n The total cumulative dose\n Intravenous bolus administration versus infusion\n Higher single doses\n History of prior irradiation\n Use of concomitant agents known to have cardiotoxicity\n Female gender\n Underlying CV disease\n Age (young and elderly)\n An increase in cardiac biomarkers such as troponins during and   after administration is an indication of toxicity.8.5.5.1 Management\n Patients undergoing chemotherapy should have a careful clinical evaluation \n and assessment and treatment of CV risk factors.464,465\n Blood pressure control is important in all patients especially in those  \n being considered for VSP inhibitors.\n All patients with potential cardiotoxic chemotherapy should have an  \n echocardiogram prior to treatment. An important parameter is the LVEF  \n determined using the biplane method of discs (Simpson’s method) or  \n three-dimensional echocardiography where available. Newer techniques   to detect and quantitate regional and global myocardial dysfunction  \n (strain assessment with global longitudinal strain) can be used to detect  \n pre-clinical and subtle changes in function.\n466-469 \n Biomarkers such as troponin and natriuretic peptides can help identify  \n patients at higher risk.462,463,470,471 \nClose collaboration between the oncologist and the cardiologist is important. \nFor the oncologists, the strategy (prior to commencement) includes:465\n Identifying high risk patients (pre-existing heart disease, presence of  \n CV risk factors, age - young and old, female gender, use of high dose  \n anthracycline regimens).\n High risk patients should:\n  Have a pre-treatment cardiac function evaluation. If the LVEF is < 50%,  \n  refer to the cardiologist.  Be considered for non-cardiotoxic alternatives. \n  Have their therapy protocols adjusted where necessary (e.g. reduction \n  in doses, continuous infusions rather than bolus injections, liposomal    doxorubicin, dexrazoxane etc). \nFor the cardiologists/general physicians, the strategy includes:\n Treating CV risk factors. \n Assessing, repeating (if necessary) imaging studies. (e.g. using high  \n quality LVEF measurement, strain evaluation etc).\n Assessing cardiac biomarkers (troponin and/or NP).\n Considering cardio-protection prior to/or during treatment using β-blockers,  \n MRA and/or ACE-I/ARB if:69,465,472-474\n  EF < 50%, \n  EF drops by > 10%\n  Abnormal global longitudinal strain (GLS) (> 15% drop).  Monitoring LVEF during therapy is important with repeat echocardiography  \n at 3-monthly intervals and/or according to symptoms. If cardioprotective  \n medications are given, monitoring may be necessary at closer intervals of  \n time depending on the clinical condition of the patient e.g. 1-monthly interval. \n Withholding cardiotoxic therapy only as a last resort. (for anthracycline  \n LVEF < 45%, for anti-HER2 therapy LVEF < 40%).\n Monitoring even after completion of therapy:\n  Obtain post therapy LVEF.\n  Repeat echocardiography in 6 months or 1 year. Most cases of  \n  treatment-associated cardiac dysfunction develop within the first year  \n  after completion of therapy.475,476 \n  If EF remains abnormal, follow guidelines for management of HF.465 \n \n8.5.6 HEART FAILURE AND KIDNEY DYSFUNCTION\n8.5.6.1 Epidemiology, definitions and classifications Cardiac and pre-existing kidney disease at admission frequently co-exist, \nvarying from 45.4% in patients with chronic HF to > 60% in those with AHF.\n477,478 \nIn addition, during treatment of AHF, a significant proportion of patients will develop varying degrees of worsening renal function (WRF).\nThe definition of WRF is:\n479\n An increase in serum creatinine by ≥ 26.5μmol/ L (0.3mg/dl) and/or\n A ≥ 25% increase in serum creatinine or a ≥ 20% drop in eGFR.\nThe rise in serum creatinine usually occurs in the first three to five days of \nhospitalisation. The incidence of WRF is estimated to be between 19 and 45%.165 This large \nobserved range is due to variations in the definitions of WRF, the observed time-at-risk and the study population.\n165 \nRisk factors for WRF during admission for HF include:480\n A prior history of HF or diabetes, \n An admission serum creatinine of > 133μmol/L,  or \n Systolic blood pressure > 160mmHg. \nWRF may fulfill criteria for type 1 or type 2 cardiorenal syndrome (CRS). The term “cardiorenal syndrome” refers to disorders of the heart and kidneys whereby acute or chronic dysfunction in one organ may induce acute or chronic dysfunction of the other.\n165 \nThis syndrome has been classified by the Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative working group into 5 subtypes as shown in Table 17, Page 105.\n165 Many \npatients however, may belong to more than one subtype and may move between subtypes during the course of their disease.\n165\n8.5.6.2. Pathogenesis of CRS \nMultiple mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of CRS. These include:\n Increased renal venous pressure  - venous congestion is probably the  \n most important factor.481 \n RV dysfunction.\n Reduced renal perfusion with reduced cardiac output. \n Neurohumoral adaptations (e.g. activation of the sympathetic nervous  \n system and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, increases in  \n vasopressin and endothelin-1).8.5.6.3  Clinical significance /Impact of kidney dysfunction in HF  The combination of cardiac and kidney disease increases the complexity and \ncosts of care, and may interact to worsen prognosis. \nA. Pharmacologic considerations \n Safety:\n  Dosing of renally-excreted cardiac drugs need adjustment in the  \n  presence of renal impairment (e.g. digoxin, insulin, low molecular  \n  weight heparin).\n  Patients with HF are at increased risk of contrast-induced acute kidney \n  injury. \n Efficacy:\n  Impaired renal function will affect drug choices and dosing. If eGFR <  \n  30mls/min/1.73m2, most thiazide diuretics are no longer effective and  \n  loop diuretics are preferred. Higher doses of loop diuretics may be   \n  required with increasing renal impairment.             B. Prognostic implications\n Preexisting CKD is a bad prognostic indicator in patients with HF - the  \n more severe the CKD, the worse the mortality.482,483\n In patients with HF, WRF may not always indicate a poor outcome.484 The  \n prognostic value of WRF is mainly determined by:   The presence of persistent congestion  \n  Baseline renal function and magnitude of renal changes \n  Duration - persistent WRF is usually associated with hemodynamic  \n  derangements and poor prognosis as compared with transient WRF  \n  as a result of agressive decongestive therapy.485-487\nTable 17: Classification of Cardiorenal Syndrome (CRS)8.5.6.4. Management \n A multi-disciplinary approach is recommended. Early referral to a  \n nephrologist is advisable.   \n Exclude potentially reversible causes for increasing renal dysfunction  \n such as hyper - or hypovolaemia, concomitant medications such as  \n aminoglycosides and NSAIDs, ACE-I or ARB and renal artery stenosis. \n Closely monitor electrolytes and kidney function, especially during acute  \n illnesses, dehydration and when increasing doses of cardiac drugs  \n including diuretics. The baseline renal function will determine how frequently \n this should be done. \n The recommended range for serum potassium is 4-5.5mmol/L.488 \n Wherever possible, avoid nephrotoxins, e.g. contrast media for angiography\n Intravenous diuretics \n  Loop diuretics are the first choice.\n  Continuous infusion may not have greater benefits compared with  \n  bolus dosing.115-118,489\n  Start initially with 2-2.5 times the usual oral dose. \n  Combination therapy (loop diuretic and thiazide/thiazide-like diuretic/\n  mineralocorticoid) may be required to enhance diuresis.205-207 However,  \n  care is required to avoid electrolyte disturbances, hypovolaemia and  \n  worsening renal dysfunction. \n Careful use of Renin Angiotensin System (RAS) blockers  \n  HF patients with stable, chronic mild-moderate renal insufficiency  \n  (eGFR > 30mls/min/1.73m2) should receive standard therapy with an  \n  ACE-I/ ARB and an MRA.490\n  A serum creatinine rise or GFR decrease by up to 30% from baseline  \n  may be acceptable before it becomes necessary to consider stopping  \n  or decreasing doses.221 \n  In patients with advanced renal failure, the decision to start or stop  \n  RAS blockers should be individualised.490\n  Consider withholding RAS blockers during aggressive diuresis in  \n  patients at high risk for WRF.  RAS blockers (and β-blockers) can be used in patients with HF who  \n  are on chronic dialysis therapy.\n Ultrafiltration \n  This involves the removal of plasma water across a semi-permeable  \n  membrane in response to a transmembrane pressure gradient.   It may be considered for congestive symptoms refractory to diuresis,  \n  but should be used in consultation with a nephrologist.\n491\n  Evidence for its efficacy in fluid removal is mixed at present.491  Haemodialysis \n  Criteria for possible need to initiate renal replacement therapy include:\n   Oliguria unresponsive to fluid resuscitation.\n   Severe hyperkalaemia (serum potassium > 6.5mmol/L).\n   Severe acidaemia (pH < 7.2). \n   Serum urea > 25mmol/L. \n    Serum creatinine > 300μmol/L. \n8.6  ADVANCED HEART FAILURE/REFRACTORY HEART FAILURE\nThese are patients with severe symptoms of HF despite maximal medical \ntherapy. Hospital admission is necessary for stabilisation. Meticulous control of fluid balance is important. Aggravating causes of HF as listed in Table 5, Page 39 should be identified and treated.\nThese patients may need specialised treatment in CCU or ICU. The following \nmay be required:\n Intravenous infusion of frusemide. These patients may require combination  \n loop diuretics and thiazides.\n Intravenous infusion of inotropes - low dose dobutamine (5mcg/kg/min) or  \n milrinone. These improve symptoms but no survival benefit has been  \n demonstrated.126,492\n Ultrafiltration in patients who are fluid overloaded.493 In most patients,  \n however, the relief is temporary.\nThe prognosis of these patients is poor. They should be referred to assess \nwhether they may be potential candidates for mechanical circulatory support (e.g. LVAD) and consideration for heart transplant.\n8.6.1 HEART TRANSPLANTHeart transplantation is a well-established treatment of refractory end stage \nHF. This definitive therapy for HF however is limited by the lack of donor organs.\n494,495All patients with severe symptomatic HF despite optimal medical therapy and no other alternative therapy option should be considered for heart transplant. They need to be referred to a HF specialist cardiac hospital for further evaluation.\nAssessment for heart transplant is done by a multispeciality, multidisciplinary \nteam and appropriate work up will be performed for eligibility.\nEligibility criteria to be considered for heart transplant include:\n Poor LVEF (< 25%).\n Recurrent HF hospitalisations.\n Major limitation of the patient’s daily activities.\n Poor effort tolerance i.e. peak VO2 (maximal oxygen consumption or  \n peak oxygen uptake) less than 10ml/kg/min (or < 50% predicted). VO2  \n max is the maximum rate of oxygen consumption measured during  \n incremental exercise ie exercise of increasing intensity and is widely  \n used as an indicator of cardiorespiratory fitness.\n Intravenous inotropic dependence for symptomatic relief or to maintain  \n end organ function.\n Motivated, psychologically stable and compliant to therapy.\nContraindications to heart transplant\n Active infection.\n Severe peripheral arterial or cerebrovascular disease.\n Malignancy within 5 years.\n Diabetes mellitus with widespread microvascular complications.\n Systemic disease with multi-organ dysfunction.\n Irreversible chronic kidney, liver or lung disease.\n Pharmacologically irreversible pulmonary hypertension.\n Other medical or psychosocial issues that would impact survival.\n8.6.2 MECHANICAL CIRCULATORY SUPPORT The use of mechanical circulatory support (e.g. LVAD), should be considered \nfor patients with potentially reversible or treatable conditions or as a bridge to heart transplant in suitable candidates.\nLVAD may also be used as destination therapy in candidates who are not \nsuitable for transplant. Patients have improvement in their symptoms when compared to optimal medical therapy.\n496,497 However, the rate of rehospitalisations \ndue to complications of bleeding, thrombosis and infections are high.496-498 \nMany patients also go into major depression. Thus, extensive discussion with the patient and family is necessary prior to LVAD implantation.8.7 PALLIATIVE AND END OF LIFE CARE\nDespite recent advances in therapy, for some patients, HF remains a \nprogressive disease and carries a poor prognosis. Patients with refractory symptoms despite guideline-directed medical therapy, should be considered for palliative and end of life care if they have the following characteristics:\n499\n Progressive functional decline (mental and physical) and dependence in  \n most activities of daily living.\n Severe HF symptoms with poor quality of life despite optimal pharmacological \n and non-pharmacological therapies.\n Frequent hospital admissions or serious episodes of decompensation  \n despite optimal therapies.\n Heart transplantation and mechanical circulatory support ruled out.\n Cardiac cachexia.\n Clinically judged to be near end of life.\nThe aim of palliative care in HF is to prevent and relieve suffering and to promote the best quality of life for patients and their families.\n500\nDespite the complexities of end-of-life issues in HF patients, there is minimal evidence-based guidance on the care of this population.\n501 The key components \nof end-of-life care are:\n 1. Advanced care plan with directives and informed decisions on:\n   Use or withdrawal of treatment including advanced therapies such  \n   as V inotropes, ICD and mechanical circulatory support. \n   When it would be appropriate to switch off devices such as ICD or  \n   CRT. \n   Resuscitation status.\n   Preferred location of death (i.e. at home or hospital).\n 2. Symptom management \n  Goals of care at this stage should shift from extending life to controlling \n  symptoms and maximising quality of life. Common symptoms include:\n   Dyspnoea\n   Fatigue\n   Pain\n   Urinary retention \n  Constipation\n  Cachexia\n  Depression\n Medications that may be useful include analgesics, antiemetics, anxiolytics,  \n opioids, laxatives, and diuretics, etc. \n3. Psychosocial support\n The impact of HF on quality of life for the patient and family is complex and  \n extends beyond physical symptoms.502\n Emotional, spiritual and social support should be provided to alleviate patient  \n anxiety about dying, and to guide patient towards a peaceful journey at the end  \n of life.\n9.1 LEVEL OF CARE AND SHARED MANAGEMENT \nThe care of patients with HF should ideally take place in a multidisciplinary system, \nallowing for shared care between the hospital (secondary or tertiary settings) and \ncommunity (primary setting). A multidisciplinary approach encompasses patient \neducation, cardiac rehabilitation, psychosocial support and palliative care, and has been proven to reduce HF hospitalisations and mortality in discharged patients.\n503-505\nThe multidisciplinary team usually consists of cardiologists and or general physicians, HF nurses, pharmacists, dieticians, physiotherapists, primary care \nproviders, social workers as well as geriatricians, psychologists, occupational \ntherapists and when necessary, palliative care specialists. Care can be done in two different settings: \n In the patient’s own home - home-based interventions are associated with  \n significantly lower healthcare costs, reduced hospital readmissions and an  \n improvement in the patient’s quality of life.506 This may however, not be feasible  \n in our local setting.\n Specialist outpatient clinic - the Heart Failure Clinic (HFC). \nHFCs can either be:\n Nurse-directed - these are run by nurses with special training in HF.\n Physician-directed - run by general physicians and/or cardiologists. \nHFCs can be established in the tertiary hospitals or in the primary care setting. The minimum human resource requirements are a:\n Cardiologist or general physician with an interest in cardiology and HF, \n Dedicated nurse and \n Medical technologist for blood taking, doing echocardiography and 6 minutes \n walk tests.In bigger clinic settings, the involvement of physiotherapists to encourage physical \nactivity, pharmacists and counsellors for end of life care would be advisable.\nThese clinics will be the intermediary between in-patient hospital care and community \nprimary care. Patients who can be seen in these clinics include those:507\n Recently discharged after an admission for decompensated HF (a waiting \n time of 7-12 days post discharge has to be the maximum wait-time).\n Who are in the early decompensation phase and need treatment modification.\n Who are stable but need uptitration of HF medications.\n With ICD or CRTs. \n With comorbidities, such as renal dysfunction, diabetes and COPD.\n With advanced HF who may benefit from:\n  Heart transplant\n  Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD)\n  Palliative care.\nThe objectives of these HF clinics may vary based on local settings. These include:\n507,508\n Optimisation of medical therapy particularly the uptitration of β-blockers, ACE-I  \n and MRA. \n Education of the patient and caregiver on the nature of the disease and its  \n progression. \n Promotion of self-care such as :\n  Compliance to medical therapy and fluid restriction.\n  Regular weighing and adjusting diuretic doses according to symptoms and  \n  body weight.\nPatient with optimised HF medications/treatment plans can be discharged to the \ncommunity with appropriate care plans to primary care. Close partnership between these HF clinics and primary care helps to reduce unnecessary admissions to hospital. \nIn 2018, the Heart Failure Medication Therapy Adherence Clinic (MTAC) was \nintroduced. These clinics are conducted by pharmacists in collaboration with doctors and other healthcare providers to improve HF management. The objectives of the Heart Failure MTAC are:\n509\n Enhance patient’s adherence to HF pharmacotherapy and non-pharmacological  \n interventions.\n To reduce unscheduled emergency department visits or hospitalisations of HF  \n patient due to acute decompensation.\n To provide consultative service to doctors on evidence-based HF pharmacotherapy  \n and related issues.\n To collaborate with doctors and other health care professionals in HF management  \n program.9.2 MONITORING AND FOLLOW-UP \nPatients with HF require regular follow-up and monitoring. Serial evaluations serve \nto assess a patient’s status, response to therapy, development of complications and disease progression. Key components of assessment include:\n Functional capacity - NYHA functional class or 6-minute walk test \n Fluid status and body weight \n Blood pressure, heart rate and rhythm \n Examination of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems\n Cognitive status and nutritional status \n Review of pharmacotherapy - uptitration, compliance and side effects\n Serum urea, electrolytes, creatinine and eGFR as necessary\n Diet and sodium intake\n Consumption of alcohol or illicit drugs\n Smoking history.\nThe frequency of follow-up will depend on the patient’s clinical stability and need for pharmacotherapy optimisation. A patient with a recent episode of decompensation or clinical instability, for instance, should ideally be seen again soon, usually within 2 weeks. Ultimately, the intensity and type of follow-up would be determined by the local organisation of care and resources.\nRoutine serial echocardiogram is not recommended. However, if there has been a \nrecent change in clinical status or if the patient has received treatment that might significantly change certain echocardiographic parameters, a follow-up echocardiogram is reasonable to assess the LVEF and structural remodeling.\nSerial brain natriuretic peptide measurements to guide and tailor HF therapy cannot \nbe broadly recommended at the present time due to a lack of consistent evidence.\n29-32 \n9.3 CARDIOLOGY REFERRAL \nHF patients with stable symptoms may be managed at the primary care level. \nReferral to the cardiologist should be considered in the following situations: \n De novo HF for a comprehensive workup to confirm the diagnosis and determine  \n the aetiology, and to devise a management plan.\n Episodes of acute decompensation.\n Worsening HF symptoms despite appropriate therapy. \n HF complicated with symptomatic hypotension or excessive bradycardia, limiting \n uptitration of pharmacotherapy. Symptomatic stable CAD and/or acute coronary syndrome for consideration of  \n revascularisation (PCI or CABG). \n Resuscitated cardiac arrest.\n Documented or suspected significant arrhythmias e.g. AF, VT.\n Significant valvular disease not previously assessed or worsening valvular  \n dysfunction.\n Pre-conception assessment and counselling of women with significant structural  \n heart disease and a past history of HF or LV dysfunction. \n Complex congenital cardiac lesions and/or Eisenmenger’s syndrome.\nDespite taking conventional HF therapy, patients may seek alternative therapy and healing approaches that are not considered as allopathic medicine. The National Centre for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) defines complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) as a group of diverse medical and healthcare interventions, practices, products or disciplines that are not generally considered part of conventional medicine.\n10.1 Enhanced External Counter Pulsation (EECP)\nThere is inadequate evidence of clinical effectiveness of EECP in HF.\n510-513 There is \nconcern that it could precipitate or exacerbate HF. \n10.2 Stem cell therapy\nA global position paper on cardiovascular regenerative medicine stated that \ncell-based therapy in HF patients is neither positive nor consistent.514 \n10.3 Omega 3 fatty acids\nIn patients with HFrEF, it may be considered as an adjunctive therapy based on a \nsingle randomised controlled trial (RCT) which showed a small benefit in CV death and/or hospitalisations.\n515,516 10.4 Coenzyme Q10\nThere is no convincing evidence to support or refute the use of coenzyme Q10 for \npatients with HF.517\n10.5 Tai Chi\nTai Chi may improve 6 min walk test distance, quality of life and LVEF in patients with \nHF.518,519 Its effect on hard CV outcomes such as rehospitalisation, MI and mortality \nis not known. \n10.6 YogaA meta-analysis in 2014 that includes two RCTs concluded that yoga improved peak \nVO2 (exercise capacity) and quality of life in chronic HF patients.\n520 There is an \nongoing RCT to look at the effect of yoga in HFpEF patients.521\nThe focus of future development for HF in Malaysia should be towards service \nenhancement working to meet the World Heart Federation mandate of a 25% reduction in premature non-communicable disease mortality by 2025. \nFinding the balance between costs and quality remains a global challenge, and the \nunderstanding of the disease in our healthcare context is imperative to making sure we move forward regarding service delivery, human resource allocation, medical expense costs and patient outcomes. To achieve this, the following need to be undertaken: \n Epidemiological studies to understand the disease profile in the country.\n Establishment and expansion of HFCs leading to more patient-centred HF care.\n Expanding service delivery, human resource allocation, medical expense cost  \n and patient outcomes.\n Education of healthcare personnel.\nEfforts should be directed to the knowledge and understanding of the epidemiology of HF in our country, its phenotype, presentation, current adherence to guideline-directed therapy and outcomes. Regular cluster sampling cohorts or a nationwide registry should be considered. Understanding the limitations of service delivery albeit geography or human resources and making plans for better service delivery systems \nare important.\nDevelopment of HFCs, can lead to a more patient-centric HF care. (See Section 9, Pages 110-113)\nModules for HF care need to be initiated in order to train and educate general \ninternal medicine physicians. A core-curriculum for education needs to be formed to ensure adequate training has been disseminated to HFC personnel.   \nIncentives regarding HF guidelines compliance should be implemented and HF \ninnovative practice should be encouraged with awards for best clinical practice and innovation be made available. \nThis streamline approach to HF care with engagement of connected groups hopefully \nwill help in better overall patient care and experience.\nPerformance measures should be used with the goal of improving quality of care for HF.\n518,519\nProcess performance measures focus on the aspects of care that are delivered to a patient, \nwhile outcome measures focus on the end-points such as mortality or hospitalisation.\nProcess performance indicators for in-patients with HF includes:522-524\n % of patients who had documentation of NYHA Functional Class.\n % of patients who had LVEF measurement.\n % of patients with current or prior LVEF < 40% and without contraindications  \n discharged with ACE-I/ARB. \n % of patients with current or prior LVEF < 40% and without contraindications  \n discharged on β-blockers.\n % of patients with current or prior LVEF < 40% and without contraindications  \n discharged on MRA.\n % of patients with chronic or paroxysmal AF/atrial flutter without contraindications  \n on anticoagulant therapy at discharge.\n % of patients given a post discharge appointment.\nThe accepted performance measure should be more than 60%.Outcome measures indicators include:\n In-hospital mortality\n 30-day readmission for HF\nRefer to Appendix VI, Page 121 for calculation of these measures."

        "text": "1128.5.5 CARDIO-ONCOLOGY AND HEART FAILURE\nHeart disease and cancer are often linked due to:\n Common risk factors (e.g. increasing age and cigarette smoking)\n Treatment strategies \n  Chemotherapy drugs has been associated with HF, arrhythmias,  \n  vasculitis and thromboembolic disease.\n  Radiotherapy of the mediastinum and left chest can lead to CAD,  \n  myopericardial fibrosis and valvular dysfunction.\nDyspnoea in cancer patients could be due to:\n Fluid overload.\n Cardiomyopathy due to chemotherapeutic agents, stress (Takotsubo), or  \n underlying CAD.\n The primary cancer causing anaemia, lung and pericardial involvement. \nChemotherapy-induced cardiomyopathy is not common, clinical HF occurs in \n1-5% and an asymptomatic decrease in LV function in the range of 5% to 20%.\n442 Prognosis in the patients who develop HF is poor.443\nThe anthracycline class of chemotherapeutic agents remain the major cause of chemotherapy-induced cardiomyopathy.\n444,445 In the current era, newer \nagents have also been implicated in a reversible form of cardiomyopathy.446 \nChemotherapy-induced cardiomyopathy as defined by the Cardiac Review and Evaluation Committee is the presence of at least one or more of the following:\n447\n1. Cardiomyopathy characterised by a decrease in Ejection Fraction (EF)  \n globally or due to regional changes in interventricular septum contraction. \n2. Symptoms of HF.3. Signs associated with HF including but not limited to S3 gallop, tachycardia,  \n or both.4. Decline in initial EF of at least 5% to < 55% with signs and symptoms of  \n HF or asymptomatic decrease in EF of at least 10% to < 55%.Chemotherapy drugs that have been associated with HF include (Appendix V, Page120):\n Doxorubicin \n  5% at a cumulative dose of 400mg/m2 (the higher the cumulative dose, \n  the greater the risk of HF.445  \n  Even at lower doses of 180 to 240mg/m2, subclinical events can  \n  occur in up to 30% of patients about 13 years post treatment.448\n  These suggest that there is no ‘safe’ dose for doxorubicin. \n Cyclophosphamide especially in high doses and ifosfomide.449,450  \n Newer agents such as monoclonal antibodies (trastuzumab and pertuzumab), \n small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (imatinib, sunitinib, sorafenib)  \n and the proteasome inhibitor (bortezomib).  Trastuzumab especially when administered together with anthracyclines \n  and cyclophosphamide, has been associated with an increased incidence \n  of HF of 27% compared to 1.7% to 4.1% when anthracycline was not part  \n  of the therapeutic regimen.\n451-453 Symptoms are usually mild to moderate \n  and improve following medical management and termination of drug  \n  administration. Improvement is usually seen in about 4-6 weeks after    withdrawal of the agent.\n454-456 After symptomatic improvement, \n  reinstitution  of treatment is usually possible.454-456\n  Vascular endothelial growth factor signaling pathway (VSP) inhibitors  \n  (bevacizumab) can cause hypertension. Bevacizumab also blocks  \n  receptors that are involved in the compensatory response to stress in  \n  the cardiomyocytes and when the heart is unable to compensate for  \n  the hypertension, it could lead to HF.457,458 Maintaining good blood pressure \n  control can prevent HF associated with this agent. Heart failure due to  \n  VSP inhibitors is usually reversible with cessation of the agent.459\nOne must consider both the efficacy and the toxicity in choosing chemotherapeutic agents. Many of the newer targeted agents cause a reversible form of HF and symptoms usually resolve after the initiation of anti-failure medications.\n454-456,459,460 \nRisk factors for anthracycline toxicity include: 461-465\n The total cumulative dose\n Intravenous bolus administration versus infusion\n Higher single doses\n History of prior irradiation\n Use of concomitant agents known to have cardiotoxicity\n Female gender\n Underlying CV disease\n Age (young and elderly)\n An increase in cardiac biomarkers such as troponins during and   after administration is an indication of toxicity.8.5.5.1 Management\n Patients undergoing chemotherapy should have a careful clinical evaluation \n and assessment and treatment of CV risk factors.464,465\n Blood pressure control is important in all patients especially in those  \n being considered for VSP inhibitors.\n All patients with potential cardiotoxic chemotherapy should have an  \n echocardiogram prior to treatment. An important parameter is the LVEF  \n determined using the biplane method of discs (Simpson’s method) or  \n three-dimensional echocardiography where available. Newer techniques   to detect and quantitate regional and global myocardial dysfunction  \n (strain assessment with global longitudinal strain) can be used to detect  \n pre-clinical and subtle changes in function.\n466-469 \n Biomarkers such as troponin and natriuretic peptides can help identify  \n patients at higher risk.462,463,470,471 \nClose collaboration between the oncologist and the cardiologist is important. \nFor the oncologists, the strategy (prior to commencement) includes:465\n Identifying high risk patients (pre-existing heart disease, presence of  \n CV risk factors, age - young and old, female gender, use of high dose  \n anthracycline regimens).\n High risk patients should:\n  Have a pre-treatment cardiac function evaluation. If the LVEF is < 50%,  \n  refer to the cardiologist.  Be considered for non-cardiotoxic alternatives. \n  Have their therapy protocols adjusted where necessary (e.g. reduction \n  in doses, continuous infusions rather than bolus injections, liposomal    doxorubicin, dexrazoxane etc). \nFor the cardiologists/general physicians, the strategy includes:\n Treating CV risk factors. \n Assessing, repeating (if necessary) imaging studies. (e.g. using high  \n quality LVEF measurement, strain evaluation etc).\n Assessing cardiac biomarkers (troponin and/or NP).\n Considering cardio-protection prior to/or during treatment using β-blockers,  \n MRA and/or ACE-I/ARB if:69,465,472-474\n  EF < 50%, \n  EF drops by > 10%\n  Abnormal global longitudinal strain (GLS) (> 15% drop).  Monitoring LVEF during therapy is important with repeat echocardiography  \n at 3-monthly intervals and/or according to symptoms. If cardioprotective  \n medications are given, monitoring may be necessary at closer intervals of  \n time depending on the clinical condition of the patient e.g. 1-monthly interval. \n Withholding cardiotoxic therapy only as a last resort. (for anthracycline  \n LVEF < 45%, for anti-HER2 therapy LVEF < 40%).\n Monitoring even after completion of therapy:\n  Obtain post therapy LVEF.\n  Repeat echocardiography in 6 months or 1 year. Most cases of  \n  treatment-associated cardiac dysfunction develop within the first year  \n  after completion of therapy.475,476 \n  If EF remains abnormal, follow guidelines for management of HF.465 \n \n8.5.6 HEART FAILURE AND KIDNEY DYSFUNCTION\n8.5.6.1 Epidemiology, definitions and classifications Cardiac and pre-existing kidney disease at admission frequently co-exist, \nvarying from 45.4% in patients with chronic HF to > 60% in those with AHF.\n477,478 \nIn addition, during treatment of AHF, a significant proportion of patients will develop varying degrees of worsening renal function (WRF).\nThe definition of WRF is:\n479\n An increase in serum creatinine by ≥ 26.5μmol/ L (0.3mg/dl) and/or\n A ≥ 25% increase in serum creatinine or a ≥ 20% drop in eGFR.\nThe rise in serum creatinine usually occurs in the first three to five days of \nhospitalisation. The incidence of WRF is estimated to be between 19 and 45%.165 This large \nobserved range is due to variations in the definitions of WRF, the observed time-at-risk and the study population.\n165 \nRisk factors for WRF during admission for HF include:480\n A prior history of HF or diabetes, \n An admission serum creatinine of > 133μmol/L,  or \n Systolic blood pressure > 160mmHg. \nWRF may fulfill criteria for type 1 or type 2 cardiorenal syndrome (CRS). The term “cardiorenal syndrome” refers to disorders of the heart and kidneys whereby acute or chronic dysfunction in one organ may induce acute or chronic dysfunction of the other.\n165 \nThis syndrome has been classified by the Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative working group into 5 subtypes as shown in Table 17, Page 105.\n165 Many \npatients however, may belong to more than one subtype and may move between subtypes during the course of their disease.\n165\n8.5.6.2. Pathogenesis of CRS \nMultiple mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of CRS. These include:\n Increased renal venous pressure  - venous congestion is probably the  \n most important factor.481 \n RV dysfunction.\n Reduced renal perfusion with reduced cardiac output. \n Neurohumoral adaptations (e.g. activation of the sympathetic nervous  \n system and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, increases in  \n vasopressin and endothelin-1).8.5.6.3  Clinical significance /Impact of kidney dysfunction in HF  The combination of cardiac and kidney disease increases the complexity and \ncosts of care, and may interact to worsen prognosis. \nA. Pharmacologic considerations \n Safety:\n  Dosing of renally-excreted cardiac drugs need adjustment in the  \n  presence of renal impairment (e.g. digoxin, insulin, low molecular  \n  weight heparin).\n  Patients with HF are at increased risk of contrast-induced acute kidney \n  injury. \n Efficacy:\n  Impaired renal function will affect drug choices and dosing. If eGFR <  \n  30mls/min/1.73m2, most thiazide diuretics are no longer effective and  \n  loop diuretics are preferred. Higher doses of loop diuretics may be   \n  required with increasing renal impairment.             B. Prognostic implications\n Preexisting CKD is a bad prognostic indicator in patients with HF - the  \n more severe the CKD, the worse the mortality.482,483\n In patients with HF, WRF may not always indicate a poor outcome.484 The  \n prognostic value of WRF is mainly determined by:   The presence of persistent congestion  \n  Baseline renal function and magnitude of renal changes \n  Duration - persistent WRF is usually associated with hemodynamic  \n  derangements and poor prognosis as compared with transient WRF  \n  as a result of agressive decongestive therapy.485-487\nTable 17: Classification of Cardiorenal Syndrome (CRS)8.5.6.4. Management \n A multi-disciplinary approach is recommended. Early referral to a  \n nephrologist is advisable.   \n Exclude potentially reversible causes for increasing renal dysfunction  \n such as hyper - or hypovolaemia, concomitant medications such as  \n aminoglycosides and NSAIDs, ACE-I or ARB and renal artery stenosis. \n Closely monitor electrolytes and kidney function, especially during acute  \n illnesses, dehydration and when increasing doses of cardiac drugs  \n including diuretics. The baseline renal function will determine how frequently \n this should be done. \n The recommended range for serum potassium is 4-5.5mmol/L.488 \n Wherever possible, avoid nephrotoxins, e.g. contrast media for angiography\n Intravenous diuretics \n  Loop diuretics are the first choice.\n  Continuous infusion may not have greater benefits compared with  \n  bolus dosing.115-118,489\n  Start initially with 2-2.5 times the usual oral dose. \n  Combination therapy (loop diuretic and thiazide/thiazide-like diuretic/\n  mineralocorticoid) may be required to enhance diuresis.205-207 However,  \n  care is required to avoid electrolyte disturbances, hypovolaemia and  \n  worsening renal dysfunction. \n Careful use of Renin Angiotensin System (RAS) blockers  \n  HF patients with stable, chronic mild-moderate renal insufficiency  \n  (eGFR > 30mls/min/1.73m2) should receive standard therapy with an  \n  ACE-I/ ARB and an MRA.490\n  A serum creatinine rise or GFR decrease by up to 30% from baseline  \n  may be acceptable before it becomes necessary to consider stopping  \n  or decreasing doses.221 \n  In patients with advanced renal failure, the decision to start or stop  \n  RAS blockers should be individualised.490\n  Consider withholding RAS blockers during aggressive diuresis in  \n  patients at high risk for WRF.  RAS blockers (and β-blockers) can be used in patients with HF who  \n  are on chronic dialysis therapy.\n Ultrafiltration \n  This involves the removal of plasma water across a semi-permeable  \n  membrane in response to a transmembrane pressure gradient.   It may be considered for congestive symptoms refractory to diuresis,  \n  but should be used in consultation with a nephrologist.\n491\n  Evidence for its efficacy in fluid removal is mixed at present.491  Haemodialysis \n  Criteria for possible need to initiate renal replacement therapy include:\n   Oliguria unresponsive to fluid resuscitation.\n   Severe hyperkalaemia (serum potassium > 6.5mmol/L).\n   Severe acidaemia (pH < 7.2). \n   Serum urea > 25mmol/L. \n    Serum creatinine > 300μmol/L. \n8.6  ADVANCED HEART FAILURE/REFRACTORY HEART FAILURE\nThese are patients with severe symptoms of HF despite maximal medical \ntherapy. Hospital admission is necessary for stabilisation. Meticulous control of fluid balance is important. Aggravating causes of HF as listed in Table 5, Page 39 should be identified and treated.\nThese patients may need specialised treatment in CCU or ICU. The following \nmay be required:\n Intravenous infusion of frusemide. These patients may require combination  \n loop diuretics and thiazides.\n Intravenous infusion of inotropes - low dose dobutamine (5mcg/kg/min) or  \n milrinone. These improve symptoms but no survival benefit has been  \n demonstrated.126,492\n Ultrafiltration in patients who are fluid overloaded.493 In most patients,  \n however, the relief is temporary.\nThe prognosis of these patients is poor. They should be referred to assess \nwhether they may be potential candidates for mechanical circulatory support (e.g. LVAD) and consideration for heart transplant.\n8.6.1 HEART TRANSPLANTHeart transplantation is a well-established treatment of refractory end stage \nHF. This definitive therapy for HF however is limited by the lack of donor organs.\n494,495All patients with severe symptomatic HF despite optimal medical therapy and no other alternative therapy option should be considered for heart transplant. They need to be referred to a HF specialist cardiac hospital for further evaluation.\nAssessment for heart transplant is done by a multispeciality, multidisciplinary \nteam and appropriate work up will be performed for eligibility.\nEligibility criteria to be considered for heart transplant include:\n Poor LVEF (< 25%).\n Recurrent HF hospitalisations.\n Major limitation of the patient’s daily activities.\n Poor effort tolerance i.e. peak VO2 (maximal oxygen consumption or  \n peak oxygen uptake) less than 10ml/kg/min (or < 50% predicted). VO2  \n max is the maximum rate of oxygen consumption measured during  \n incremental exercise ie exercise of increasing intensity and is widely  \n used as an indicator of cardiorespiratory fitness.\n Intravenous inotropic dependence for symptomatic relief or to maintain  \n end organ function.\n Motivated, psychologically stable and compliant to therapy.\nContraindications to heart transplant\n Active infection.\n Severe peripheral arterial or cerebrovascular disease.\n Malignancy within 5 years.\n Diabetes mellitus with widespread microvascular complications.\n Systemic disease with multi-organ dysfunction.\n Irreversible chronic kidney, liver or lung disease.\n Pharmacologically irreversible pulmonary hypertension.\n Other medical or psychosocial issues that would impact survival.\n8.6.2 MECHANICAL CIRCULATORY SUPPORT The use of mechanical circulatory support (e.g. LVAD), should be considered \nfor patients with potentially reversible or treatable conditions or as a bridge to heart transplant in suitable candidates.\nLVAD may also be used as destination therapy in candidates who are not \nsuitable for transplant. Patients have improvement in their symptoms when compared to optimal medical therapy.\n496,497 However, the rate of rehospitalisations \ndue to complications of bleeding, thrombosis and infections are high.496-498 \nMany patients also go into major depression. Thus, extensive discussion with the patient and family is necessary prior to LVAD implantation.8.7 PALLIATIVE AND END OF LIFE CARE\nDespite recent advances in therapy, for some patients, HF remains a \nprogressive disease and carries a poor prognosis. Patients with refractory symptoms despite guideline-directed medical therapy, should be considered for palliative and end of life care if they have the following characteristics:\n499\n Progressive functional decline (mental and physical) and dependence in  \n most activities of daily living.\n Severe HF symptoms with poor quality of life despite optimal pharmacological \n and non-pharmacological therapies.\n Frequent hospital admissions or serious episodes of decompensation  \n despite optimal therapies.\n Heart transplantation and mechanical circulatory support ruled out.\n Cardiac cachexia.\n Clinically judged to be near end of life.\nThe aim of palliative care in HF is to prevent and relieve suffering and to promote the best quality of life for patients and their families.\n500\nDespite the complexities of end-of-life issues in HF patients, there is minimal evidence-based guidance on the care of this population.\n501 The key components \nof end-of-life care are:\n 1. Advanced care plan with directives and informed decisions on:\n   Use or withdrawal of treatment including advanced therapies such  \n   as V inotropes, ICD and mechanical circulatory support. \n   When it would be appropriate to switch off devices such as ICD or  \n   CRT. \n   Resuscitation status.\n   Preferred location of death (i.e. at home or hospital).\n 2. Symptom management \n  Goals of care at this stage should shift from extending life to controlling \n  symptoms and maximising quality of life. Common symptoms include:\n   Dyspnoea\n   Fatigue\n   Pain\n   Urinary retention \n  Constipation\n  Cachexia\n  Depression\n Medications that may be useful include analgesics, antiemetics, anxiolytics,  \n opioids, laxatives, and diuretics, etc. \n3. Psychosocial support\n The impact of HF on quality of life for the patient and family is complex and  \n extends beyond physical symptoms.502\n Emotional, spiritual and social support should be provided to alleviate patient  \n anxiety about dying, and to guide patient towards a peaceful journey at the end  \n of life.\n9.1 LEVEL OF CARE AND SHARED MANAGEMENT \nThe care of patients with HF should ideally take place in a multidisciplinary system, \nallowing for shared care between the hospital (secondary or tertiary settings) and \ncommunity (primary setting). A multidisciplinary approach encompasses patient \neducation, cardiac rehabilitation, psychosocial support and palliative care, and has been proven to reduce HF hospitalisations and mortality in discharged patients.\n503-505\nThe multidisciplinary team usually consists of cardiologists and or general physicians, HF nurses, pharmacists, dieticians, physiotherapists, primary care \nproviders, social workers as well as geriatricians, psychologists, occupational \ntherapists and when necessary, palliative care specialists. Care can be done in two different settings: \n In the patient’s own home - home-based interventions are associated with  \n significantly lower healthcare costs, reduced hospital readmissions and an  \n improvement in the patient’s quality of life.506 This may however, not be feasible  \n in our local setting.\n Specialist outpatient clinic - the Heart Failure Clinic (HFC). \nHFCs can either be:\n Nurse-directed - these are run by nurses with special training in HF.\n Physician-directed - run by general physicians and/or cardiologists. \nHFCs can be established in the tertiary hospitals or in the primary care setting. The minimum human resource requirements are a:\n Cardiologist or general physician with an interest in cardiology and HF, \n Dedicated nurse and \n Medical technologist for blood taking, doing echocardiography and 6 minutes \n walk tests.In bigger clinic settings, the involvement of physiotherapists to encourage physical \nactivity, pharmacists and counsellors for end of life care would be advisable.\nThese clinics will be the intermediary between in-patient hospital care and community \nprimary care. Patients who can be seen in these clinics include those:507\n Recently discharged after an admission for decompensated HF (a waiting \n time of 7-12 days post discharge has to be the maximum wait-time).\n Who are in the early decompensation phase and need treatment modification.\n Who are stable but need uptitration of HF medications.\n With ICD or CRTs. \n With comorbidities, such as renal dysfunction, diabetes and COPD.\n With advanced HF who may benefit from:\n  Heart transplant\n  Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD)\n  Palliative care.\nThe objectives of these HF clinics may vary based on local settings. These include:\n507,508\n Optimisation of medical therapy particularly the uptitration of β-blockers, ACE-I  \n and MRA. \n Education of the patient and caregiver on the nature of the disease and its  \n progression. \n Promotion of self-care such as :\n  Compliance to medical therapy and fluid restriction.\n  Regular weighing and adjusting diuretic doses according to symptoms and  \n  body weight.\nPatient with optimised HF medications/treatment plans can be discharged to the \ncommunity with appropriate care plans to primary care. Close partnership between these HF clinics and primary care helps to reduce unnecessary admissions to hospital. \nIn 2018, the Heart Failure Medication Therapy Adherence Clinic (MTAC) was \nintroduced. These clinics are conducted by pharmacists in collaboration with doctors and other healthcare providers to improve HF management. The objectives of the Heart Failure MTAC are:\n509\n Enhance patient’s adherence to HF pharmacotherapy and non-pharmacological  \n interventions.\n To reduce unscheduled emergency department visits or hospitalisations of HF  \n patient due to acute decompensation.\n To provide consultative service to doctors on evidence-based HF pharmacotherapy  \n and related issues.\n To collaborate with doctors and other health care professionals in HF management  \n program.9.2 MONITORING AND FOLLOW-UP \nPatients with HF require regular follow-up and monitoring. Serial evaluations serve \nto assess a patient’s status, response to therapy, development of complications and disease progression. Key components of assessment include:\n Functional capacity - NYHA functional class or 6-minute walk test \n Fluid status and body weight \n Blood pressure, heart rate and rhythm \n Examination of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems\n Cognitive status and nutritional status \n Review of pharmacotherapy - uptitration, compliance and side effects\n Serum urea, electrolytes, creatinine and eGFR as necessary\n Diet and sodium intake\n Consumption of alcohol or illicit drugs\n Smoking history.\nThe frequency of follow-up will depend on the patient’s clinical stability and need for pharmacotherapy optimisation. A patient with a recent episode of decompensation or clinical instability, for instance, should ideally be seen again soon, usually within 2 weeks. Ultimately, the intensity and type of follow-up would be determined by the local organisation of care and resources.\nRoutine serial echocardiogram is not recommended. However, if there has been a \nrecent change in clinical status or if the patient has received treatment that might significantly change certain echocardiographic parameters, a follow-up echocardiogram is reasonable to assess the LVEF and structural remodeling.\nSerial brain natriuretic peptide measurements to guide and tailor HF therapy cannot \nbe broadly recommended at the present time due to a lack of consistent evidence.\n29-32 \n9.3 CARDIOLOGY REFERRAL \nHF patients with stable symptoms may be managed at the primary care level. \nReferral to the cardiologist should be considered in the following situations: \n De novo HF for a comprehensive workup to confirm the diagnosis and determine  \n the aetiology, and to devise a management plan.\n Episodes of acute decompensation.\n Worsening HF symptoms despite appropriate therapy. \n HF complicated with symptomatic hypotension or excessive bradycardia, limiting \n uptitration of pharmacotherapy. Symptomatic stable CAD and/or acute coronary syndrome for consideration of  \n revascularisation (PCI or CABG). \n Resuscitated cardiac arrest.\n Documented or suspected significant arrhythmias e.g. AF, VT.\n Significant valvular disease not previously assessed or worsening valvular  \n dysfunction.\n Pre-conception assessment and counselling of women with significant structural  \n heart disease and a past history of HF or LV dysfunction. \n Complex congenital cardiac lesions and/or Eisenmenger’s syndrome.\nDespite taking conventional HF therapy, patients may seek alternative therapy and healing approaches that are not considered as allopathic medicine. The National Centre for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) defines complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) as a group of diverse medical and healthcare interventions, practices, products or disciplines that are not generally considered part of conventional medicine.\n10.1 Enhanced External Counter Pulsation (EECP)\nThere is inadequate evidence of clinical effectiveness of EECP in HF.\n510-513 There is \nconcern that it could precipitate or exacerbate HF. \n10.2 Stem cell therapy\nA global position paper on cardiovascular regenerative medicine stated that \ncell-based therapy in HF patients is neither positive nor consistent.514 \n10.3 Omega 3 fatty acids\nIn patients with HFrEF, it may be considered as an adjunctive therapy based on a \nsingle randomised controlled trial (RCT) which showed a small benefit in CV death and/or hospitalisations.\n515,516 10.4 Coenzyme Q10\nThere is no convincing evidence to support or refute the use of coenzyme Q10 for \npatients with HF.517\n10.5 Tai Chi\nTai Chi may improve 6 min walk test distance, quality of life and LVEF in patients with \nHF.518,519 Its effect on hard CV outcomes such as rehospitalisation, MI and mortality \nis not known. \n10.6 YogaA meta-analysis in 2014 that includes two RCTs concluded that yoga improved peak \nVO2 (exercise capacity) and quality of life in chronic HF patients.\n520 There is an \nongoing RCT to look at the effect of yoga in HFpEF patients.521\nThe focus of future development for HF in Malaysia should be towards service \nenhancement working to meet the World Heart Federation mandate of a 25% reduction in premature non-communicable disease mortality by 2025. \nFinding the balance between costs and quality remains a global challenge, and the \nunderstanding of the disease in our healthcare context is imperative to making sure we move forward regarding service delivery, human resource allocation, medical expense costs and patient outcomes. To achieve this, the following need to be undertaken: \n Epidemiological studies to understand the disease profile in the country.\n Establishment and expansion of HFCs leading to more patient-centred HF care.\n Expanding service delivery, human resource allocation, medical expense cost  \n and patient outcomes.\n Education of healthcare personnel.\nEfforts should be directed to the knowledge and understanding of the epidemiology of HF in our country, its phenotype, presentation, current adherence to guideline-directed therapy and outcomes. Regular cluster sampling cohorts or a nationwide registry should be considered. Understanding the limitations of service delivery albeit geography or human resources and making plans for better service delivery systems \nare important.\nDevelopment of HFCs, can lead to a more patient-centric HF care. (See Section 9, Pages 110-113)\nModules for HF care need to be initiated in order to train and educate general \ninternal medicine physicians. A core-curriculum for education needs to be formed to ensure adequate training has been disseminated to HFC personnel.   \nIncentives regarding HF guidelines compliance should be implemented and HF \ninnovative practice should be encouraged with awards for best clinical practice and innovation be made available. \nThis streamline approach to HF care with engagement of connected groups hopefully \nwill help in better overall patient care and experience.\nPerformance measures should be used with the goal of improving quality of care for HF.\n518,519\nProcess performance measures focus on the aspects of care that are delivered to a patient, \nwhile outcome measures focus on the end-points such as mortality or hospitalisation.\nProcess performance indicators for in-patients with HF includes:522-524\n % of patients who had documentation of NYHA Functional Class.\n % of patients who had LVEF measurement.\n % of patients with current or prior LVEF < 40% and without contraindications  \n discharged with ACE-I/ARB. \n % of patients with current or prior LVEF < 40% and without contraindications  \n discharged on β-blockers.\n % of patients with current or prior LVEF < 40% and without contraindications  \n discharged on MRA.\n % of patients with chronic or paroxysmal AF/atrial flutter without contraindications  \n on anticoagulant therapy at discharge.\n % of patients given a post discharge appointment.\nThe accepted performance measure should be more than 60%.Outcome measures indicators include:\n In-hospital mortality\n 30-day readmission for HF\nRefer to Appendix VI, Page 121 for calculation of these measures."

OTHER THERAPIES FOR HEART FAILURE8.5.5 CARDIO-ONCOLOGY AND HEART FAILURE\nHeart disease and cancer are often linked due to:\n Common risk factors (e.g. increasing age and cigarette smoking)\n Treatment strategies \n  Chemotherapy drugs has been associated with HF, arrhythmias,  \n  vasculitis and thromboembolic disease.\n  Radiotherapy of the mediastinum and left chest can lead to CAD,  \n  myopericardial fibrosis and valvular dysfunction.\nDyspnoea in cancer patients could be due to:\n Fluid overload.\n Cardiomyopathy due to chemotherapeutic agents, stress (Takotsubo), or  \n underlying CAD.\n The primary cancer causing anaemia, lung and pericardial involvement. \nChemotherapy-induced cardiomyopathy is not common, clinical HF occurs in \n1-5% and an asymptomatic decrease in LV function in the range of 5% to 20%.\n442 Prognosis in the patients who develop HF is poor.443\nThe anthracycline class of chemotherapeutic agents remain the major cause of chemotherapy-induced cardiomyopathy.\n444,445 In the current era, newer \nagents have also been implicated in a reversible form of cardiomyopathy.446 \nChemotherapy-induced cardiomyopathy as defined by the Cardiac Review and Evaluation Committee is the presence of at least one or more of the following:\n447\n1. Cardiomyopathy characterised by a decrease in Ejection Fraction (EF)  \n globally or due to regional changes in interventricular septum contraction. \n2. Symptoms of HF.3. Signs associated with HF including but not limited to S3 gallop, tachycardia,  \n or both.4. Decline in initial EF of at least 5% to < 55% with signs and symptoms of  \n HF or asymptomatic decrease in EF of at least 10% to < 55%.Chemotherapy drugs that have been associated with HF include (Appendix V, Page120):\n Doxorubicin \n  5% at a cumulative dose of 400mg/m2 (the higher the cumulative dose, \n  the greater the risk of HF.445  \n  Even at lower doses of 180 to 240mg/m2, subclinical events can  \n  occur in up to 30% of patients about 13 years post treatment.448\n  These suggest that there is no ‘safe’ dose for doxorubicin. \n Cyclophosphamide especially in high doses and ifosfomide.449,450  \n Newer agents such as monoclonal antibodies (trastuzumab and pertuzumab), \n small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (imatinib, sunitinib, sorafenib)  \n and the proteasome inhibitor (bortezomib).  Trastuzumab especially when administered together with anthracyclines \n  and cyclophosphamide, has been associated with an increased incidence \n  of HF of 27% compared to 1.7% to 4.1% when anthracycline was not part  \n  of the therapeutic regimen.\n451-453 Symptoms are usually mild to moderate \n  and improve following medical management and termination of drug  \n  administration. Improvement is usually seen in about 4-6 weeks after    withdrawal of the agent.\n454-456 After symptomatic improvement, \n  reinstitution  of treatment is usually possible.454-456\n  Vascular endothelial growth factor signaling pathway (VSP) inhibitors  \n  (bevacizumab) can cause hypertension. Bevacizumab also blocks  \n  receptors that are involved in the compensatory response to stress in  \n  the cardiomyocytes and when the heart is unable to compensate for  \n  the hypertension, it could lead to HF.457,458 Maintaining good blood pressure \n  control can prevent HF associated with this agent. Heart failure due to  \n  VSP inhibitors is usually reversible with cessation of the agent.459\nOne must consider both the efficacy and the toxicity in choosing chemotherapeutic agents. Many of the newer targeted agents cause a reversible form of HF and symptoms usually resolve after the initiation of anti-failure medications.\n454-456,459,460 \nRisk factors for anthracycline toxicity include: 461-465\n The total cumulative dose\n Intravenous bolus administration versus infusion\n Higher single doses\n History of prior irradiation\n Use of concomitant agents known to have cardiotoxicity\n Female gender\n Underlying CV disease\n Age (young and elderly)\n An increase in cardiac biomarkers such as troponins during and   after administration is an indication of toxicity.8.5.5.1 Management\n Patients undergoing chemotherapy should have a careful clinical evaluation \n and assessment and treatment of CV risk factors.464,465\n Blood pressure control is important in all patients especially in those  \n being considered for VSP inhibitors.\n All patients with potential cardiotoxic chemotherapy should have an  \n echocardiogram prior to treatment. An important parameter is the LVEF  \n determined using the biplane method of discs (Simpson’s method) or  \n three-dimensional echocardiography where available. Newer techniques   to detect and quantitate regional and global myocardial dysfunction  \n (strain assessment with global longitudinal strain) can be used to detect  \n pre-clinical and subtle changes in function.\n466-469 \n Biomarkers such as troponin and natriuretic peptides can help identify  \n patients at higher risk.462,463,470,471 \nClose collaboration between the oncologist and the cardiologist is important. \nFor the oncologists, the strategy (prior to commencement) includes:465\n Identifying high risk patients (pre-existing heart disease, presence of  \n CV risk factors, age - young and old, female gender, use of high dose  \n anthracycline regimens).\n High risk patients should:\n  Have a pre-treatment cardiac function evaluation. If the LVEF is < 50%,  \n  refer to the cardiologist.  Be considered for non-cardiotoxic alternatives. \n  Have their therapy protocols adjusted where necessary (e.g. reduction \n  in doses, continuous infusions rather than bolus injections, liposomal    doxorubicin, dexrazoxane etc). \nFor the cardiologists/general physicians, the strategy includes:\n Treating CV risk factors. \n Assessing, repeating (if necessary) imaging studies. (e.g. using high  \n quality LVEF measurement, strain evaluation etc).\n Assessing cardiac biomarkers (troponin and/or NP).\n Considering cardio-protection prior to/or during treatment using β-blockers,  \n MRA and/or ACE-I/ARB if:69,465,472-474\n  EF < 50%, \n  EF drops by > 10%\n  Abnormal global longitudinal strain (GLS) (> 15% drop).  Monitoring LVEF during therapy is important with repeat echocardiography  \n at 3-monthly intervals and/or according to symptoms. If cardioprotective  \n medications are given, monitoring may be necessary at closer intervals of  \n time depending on the clinical condition of the patient e.g. 1-monthly interval. \n Withholding cardiotoxic therapy only as a last resort. (for anthracycline  \n LVEF < 45%, for anti-HER2 therapy LVEF < 40%).\n Monitoring even after completion of therapy:\n  Obtain post therapy LVEF.\n  Repeat echocardiography in 6 months or 1 year. Most cases of  \n  treatment-associated cardiac dysfunction develop within the first year  \n  after completion of therapy.475,476 \n  If EF remains abnormal, follow guidelines for management of HF.465 \n \n8.5.6 HEART FAILURE AND KIDNEY DYSFUNCTION\n8.5.6.1 Epidemiology, definitions and classifications Cardiac and pre-existing kidney disease at admission frequently co-exist, \nvarying from 45.4% in patients with chronic HF to > 60% in those with AHF.\n477,478 \nIn addition, during treatment of AHF, a significant proportion of patients will develop varying degrees of worsening renal function (WRF).\nThe definition of WRF is:\n479\n An increase in serum creatinine by ≥ 26.5μmol/ L (0.3mg/dl) and/or\n A ≥ 25% increase in serum creatinine or a ≥ 20% drop in eGFR.\nThe rise in serum creatinine usually occurs in the first three to five days of \nhospitalisation. The incidence of WRF is estimated to be between 19 and 45%.165 This large \nobserved range is due to variations in the definitions of WRF, the observed time-at-risk and the study population.\n165 \nRisk factors for WRF during admission for HF include:480\n A prior history of HF or diabetes, \n An admission serum creatinine of > 133μmol/L,  or \n Systolic blood pressure > 160mmHg. \nWRF may fulfill criteria for type 1 or type 2 cardiorenal syndrome (CRS). The term “cardiorenal syndrome” refers to disorders of the heart and kidneys whereby acute or chronic dysfunction in one organ may induce acute or chronic dysfunction of the other.\n165 \nThis syndrome has been classified by the Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative working group into 5 subtypes as shown in Table 17, Page 105.\n165 Many \npatients however, may belong to more than one subtype and may move between subtypes during the course of their disease.\n165\n8.5.6.2. Pathogenesis of CRS \nMultiple mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of CRS. These include:\n Increased renal venous pressure  - venous congestion is probably the  \n most important factor.481 \n RV dysfunction.\n Reduced renal perfusion with reduced cardiac output. \n Neurohumoral adaptations (e.g. activation of the sympathetic nervous  \n system and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, increases in  \n vasopressin and endothelin-1).8.5.6.3  Clinical significance /Impact of kidney dysfunction in HF  The combination of cardiac and kidney disease increases the complexity and \ncosts of care, and may interact to worsen prognosis. \nA. Pharmacologic considerations \n Safety:\n  Dosing of renally-excreted cardiac drugs need adjustment in the  \n  presence of renal impairment (e.g. digoxin, insulin, low molecular  \n  weight heparin).\n  Patients with HF are at increased risk of contrast-induced acute kidney \n  injury. \n Efficacy:\n  Impaired renal function will affect drug choices and dosing. If eGFR <  \n  30mls/min/1.73m2, most thiazide diuretics are no longer effective and  \n  loop diuretics are preferred. Higher doses of loop diuretics may be   \n  required with increasing renal impairment.             B. Prognostic implications\n Preexisting CKD is a bad prognostic indicator in patients with HF - the  \n more severe the CKD, the worse the mortality.482,483\n In patients with HF, WRF may not always indicate a poor outcome.484 The  \n prognostic value of WRF is mainly determined by:   The presence of persistent congestion  \n  Baseline renal function and magnitude of renal changes \n  Duration - persistent WRF is usually associated with hemodynamic  \n  derangements and poor prognosis as compared with transient WRF  \n  as a result of agressive decongestive therapy.\n485-487\nTable 17: Classification of Cardiorenal Syndrome (CRS)8.5.6.4. Management \n A multi-disciplinary approach is recommended. Early referral to a  \n nephrologist is advisable.   \n Exclude potentially reversible causes for increasing renal dysfunction  \n such as hyper - or hypovolaemia, concomitant medications such as  \n aminoglycosides and NSAIDs, ACE-I or ARB and renal artery stenosis. \n Closely monitor electrolytes and kidney function, especially during acute  \n illnesses, dehydration and when increasing doses of cardiac drugs  \n including diuretics. The baseline renal function will determine how frequently \n this should be done. \n The recommended range for serum potassium is 4-5.5mmol/L.488 \n Wherever possible, avoid nephrotoxins, e.g. contrast media for angiography\n Intravenous diuretics \n  Loop diuretics are the first choice.\n  Continuous infusion may not have greater benefits compared with  \n  bolus dosing.115-118,489\n  Start initially with 2-2.5 times the usual oral dose. \n  Combination therapy (loop diuretic and thiazide/thiazide-like diuretic/\n  mineralocorticoid) may be required to enhance diuresis.205-207 However,  \n  care is required to avoid electrolyte disturbances, hypovolaemia and  \n  worsening renal dysfunction. \n Careful use of Renin Angiotensin System (RAS) blockers  \n  HF patients with stable, chronic mild-moderate renal insufficiency  \n  (eGFR > 30mls/min/1.73m2) should receive standard therapy with an  \n  ACE-I/ ARB and an MRA.490\n  A serum creatinine rise or GFR decrease by up to 30% from baseline  \n  may be acceptable before it becomes necessary to consider stopping  \n  or decreasing doses.221 \n  In patients with advanced renal failure, the decision to start or stop  \n  RAS blockers should be individualised.490\n  Consider withholding RAS blockers during aggressive diuresis in  \n  patients at high risk for WRF.  RAS blockers (and β-blockers) can be used in patients with HF who  \n  are on chronic dialysis therapy.\n Ultrafiltration \n  This involves the removal of plasma water across a semi-permeable  \n  membrane in response to a transmembrane pressure gradient.   It may be considered for congestive symptoms refractory to diuresis,  \n  but should be used in consultation with a nephrologist.\n491\n  Evidence for its efficacy in fluid removal is mixed at present.491  Haemodialysis \n  Criteria for possible need to initiate renal replacement therapy include:\n   Oliguria unresponsive to fluid resuscitation.\n   Severe hyperkalaemia (serum potassium > 6.5mmol/L).\n   Severe acidaemia (pH < 7.2). \n   Serum urea > 25mmol/L. \n    Serum creatinine > 300μmol/L. \n8.6  ADVANCED HEART FAILURE/REFRACTORY HEART FAILURE\nThese are patients with severe symptoms of HF despite maximal medical \ntherapy. Hospital admission is necessary for stabilisation. Meticulous control of fluid balance is important. Aggravating causes of HF as listed in Table 5, Page 39 should be identified and treated.\nThese patients may need specialised treatment in CCU or ICU. The following \nmay be required:\n Intravenous infusion of frusemide. These patients may require combination  \n loop diuretics and thiazides.\n Intravenous infusion of inotropes - low dose dobutamine (5mcg/kg/min) or  \n milrinone. These improve symptoms but no survival benefit has been  \n demonstrated.126,492\n Ultrafiltration in patients who are fluid overloaded.493 In most patients,  \n however, the relief is temporary.\nThe prognosis of these patients is poor. They should be referred to assess \nwhether they may be potential candidates for mechanical circulatory support (e.g. LVAD) and consideration for heart transplant.\n8.6.1 HEART TRANSPLANTHeart transplantation is a well-established treatment of refractory end stage \nHF. This definitive therapy for HF however is limited by the lack of donor organs.\n494,495All patients with severe symptomatic HF despite optimal medical therapy and no other alternative therapy option should be considered for heart transplant. They need to be referred to a HF specialist cardiac hospital for further evaluation.\nAssessment for heart transplant is done by a multispeciality, multidisciplinary \nteam and appropriate work up will be performed for eligibility.\nEligibility criteria to be considered for heart transplant include:\n Poor LVEF (< 25%).\n Recurrent HF hospitalisations.\n Major limitation of the patient’s daily activities.\n Poor effort tolerance i.e. peak VO2 (maximal oxygen consumption or  \n peak oxygen uptake) less than 10ml/kg/min (or < 50% predicted). VO2  \n max is the maximum rate of oxygen consumption measured during  \n incremental exercise ie exercise of increasing intensity and is widely  \n used as an indicator of cardiorespiratory fitness.\n Intravenous inotropic dependence for symptomatic relief or to maintain  \n end organ function.\n Motivated, psychologically stable and compliant to therapy.\nContraindications to heart transplant\n Active infection.\n Severe peripheral arterial or cerebrovascular disease.\n Malignancy within 5 years.\n Diabetes mellitus with widespread microvascular complications.\n Systemic disease with multi-organ dysfunction.\n Irreversible chronic kidney, liver or lung disease.\n Pharmacologically irreversible pulmonary hypertension.\n Other medical or psychosocial issues that would impact survival.\n8.6.2 MECHANICAL CIRCULATORY SUPPORT The use of mechanical circulatory support (e.g. LVAD), should be considered \nfor patients with potentially reversible or treatable conditions or as a bridge to heart transplant in suitable candidates.\nLVAD may also be used as destination therapy in candidates who are not \nsuitable for transplant. Patients have improvement in their symptoms when compared to optimal medical therapy.\n496,497 However, the rate of rehospitalisations \ndue to complications of bleeding, thrombosis and infections are high.496-498 \nMany patients also go into major depression. Thus, extensive discussion with the patient and family is necessary prior to LVAD implantation.8.7 PALLIATIVE AND END OF LIFE CARE\nDespite recent advances in therapy, for some patients, HF remains a \nprogressive disease and carries a poor prognosis. Patients with refractory symptoms despite guideline-directed medical therapy, should be considered for palliative and end of life care if they have the following characteristics:\n499\n Progressive functional decline (mental and physical) and dependence in  \n most activities of daily living.\n Severe HF symptoms with poor quality of life despite optimal pharmacological \n and non-pharmacological therapies.\n Frequent hospital admissions or serious episodes of decompensation  \n despite optimal therapies.\n Heart transplantation and mechanical circulatory support ruled out.\n Cardiac cachexia.\n Clinically judged to be near end of life.\nThe aim of palliative care in HF is to prevent and relieve suffering and to promote the best quality of life for patients and their families.\n500\nDespite the complexities of end-of-life issues in HF patients, there is minimal evidence-based guidance on the care of this population.\n501 The key components \nof end-of-life care are:\n 1. Advanced care plan with directives and informed decisions on:\n   Use or withdrawal of treatment including advanced therapies such  \n   as V inotropes, ICD and mechanical circulatory support. \n   When it would be appropriate to switch off devices such as ICD or  \n   CRT. \n   Resuscitation status.\n   Preferred location of death (i.e. at home or hospital).\n 2. Symptom management \n  Goals of care at this stage should shift from extending life to controlling \n  symptoms and maximising quality of life. Common symptoms include:\n   Dyspnoea\n   Fatigue\n   Pain\n   Urinary retention \n  Constipation\n  Cachexia\n  Depression\n Medications that may be useful include analgesics, antiemetics, anxiolytics,  \n opioids, laxatives, and diuretics, etc. \n3. Psychosocial support\n The impact of HF on quality of life for the patient and family is complex and  \n extends beyond physical symptoms.502\n Emotional, spiritual and social support should be provided to alleviate patient  \n anxiety about dying, and to guide patient towards a peaceful journey at the end  \n of life.\n9.1 LEVEL OF CARE AND SHARED MANAGEMENT \nThe care of patients with HF should ideally take place in a multidisciplinary system, \nallowing for shared care between the hospital (secondary or tertiary settings) and \ncommunity (primary setting). A multidisciplinary approach encompasses patient \neducation, cardiac rehabilitation, psychosocial support and palliative care, and has been proven to reduce HF hospitalisations and mortality in discharged patients.\n503-505\nThe multidisciplinary team usually consists of cardiologists and or general physicians, HF nurses, pharmacists, dieticians, physiotherapists, primary care \nproviders, social workers as well as geriatricians, psychologists, occupational \ntherapists and when necessary, palliative care specialists. Care can be done in two different settings: \n In the patient’s own home - home-based interventions are associated with  \n significantly lower healthcare costs, reduced hospital readmissions and an  \n improvement in the patient’s quality of life.506 This may however, not be feasible  \n in our local setting.\n Specialist outpatient clinic - the Heart Failure Clinic (HFC). \nHFCs can either be:\n Nurse-directed - these are run by nurses with special training in HF.\n Physician-directed - run by general physicians and/or cardiologists. \nHFCs can be established in the tertiary hospitals or in the primary care setting. The minimum human resource requirements are a:\n Cardiologist or general physician with an interest in cardiology and HF, \n Dedicated nurse and \n Medical technologist for blood taking, doing echocardiography and 6 minutes \n walk tests.In bigger clinic settings, the involvement of physiotherapists to encourage physical \nactivity, pharmacists and counsellors for end of life care would be advisable.\nThese clinics will be the intermediary between in-patient hospital care and community \nprimary care. Patients who can be seen in these clinics include those:507\n Recently discharged after an admission for decompensated HF (a waiting \n time of 7-12 days post discharge has to be the maximum wait-time).\n Who are in the early decompensation phase and need treatment modification.\n Who are stable but need uptitration of HF medications.\n With ICD or CRTs. \n With comorbidities, such as renal dysfunction, diabetes and COPD.\n With advanced HF who may benefit from:\n  Heart transplant\n  Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD)\n  Palliative care.\nThe objectives of these HF clinics may vary based on local settings. These include:\n507,508\n Optimisation of medical therapy particularly the uptitration of β-blockers, ACE-I  \n and MRA. \n Education of the patient and caregiver on the nature of the disease and its  \n progression. \n Promotion of self-care such as :\n  Compliance to medical therapy and fluid restriction.\n  Regular weighing and adjusting diuretic doses according to symptoms and  \n  body weight.\nPatient with optimised HF medications/treatment plans can be discharged to the \ncommunity with appropriate care plans to primary care. Close partnership between these HF clinics and primary care helps to reduce unnecessary admissions to hospital. \nIn 2018, the Heart Failure Medication Therapy Adherence Clinic (MTAC) was \nintroduced. These clinics are conducted by pharmacists in collaboration with doctors and other healthcare providers to improve HF management. The objectives of the Heart Failure MTAC are:\n509\n Enhance patient’s adherence to HF pharmacotherapy and non-pharmacological  \n interventions.\n To reduce unscheduled emergency department visits or hospitalisations of HF  \n patient due to acute decompensation.\n To provide consultative service to doctors on evidence-based HF pharmacotherapy  \n and related issues.\n To collaborate with doctors and other health care professionals in HF management  \n program.9.2 MONITORING AND FOLLOW-UP \nPatients with HF require regular follow-up and monitoring. Serial evaluations serve \nto assess a patient’s status, response to therapy, development of complications and disease progression. Key components of assessment include:\n Functional capacity - NYHA functional class or 6-minute walk test \n Fluid status and body weight \n Blood pressure, heart rate and rhythm \n Examination of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems\n Cognitive status and nutritional status \n Review of pharmacotherapy - uptitration, compliance and side effects\n Serum urea, electrolytes, creatinine and eGFR as necessary\n Diet and sodium intake\n Consumption of alcohol or illicit drugs\n Smoking history.\nThe frequency of follow-up will depend on the patient’s clinical stability and need for pharmacotherapy optimisation. A patient with a recent episode of decompensation or clinical instability, for instance, should ideally be seen again soon, usually within 2 weeks. Ultimately, the intensity and type of follow-up would be determined by the local organisation of care and resources.\nRoutine serial echocardiogram is not recommended. However, if there has been a \nrecent change in clinical status or if the patient has received treatment that might significantly change certain echocardiographic parameters, a follow-up echocardiogram is reasonable to assess the LVEF and structural remodeling.\nSerial brain natriuretic peptide measurements to guide and tailor HF therapy cannot \nbe broadly recommended at the present time due to a lack of consistent evidence.\n29-32 \n9.3 CARDIOLOGY REFERRAL \nHF patients with stable symptoms may be managed at the primary care level. \nReferral to the cardiologist should be considered in the following situations: \n De novo HF for a comprehensive workup to confirm the diagnosis and determine  \n the aetiology, and to devise a management plan.\n Episodes of acute decompensation.\n Worsening HF symptoms despite appropriate therapy. \n HF complicated with symptomatic hypotension or excessive bradycardia, limiting \n uptitration of pharmacotherapy. Symptomatic stable CAD and/or acute coronary syndrome for consideration of  \n revascularisation (PCI or CABG). \n Resuscitated cardiac arrest.\n Documented or suspected significant arrhythmias e.g. AF, VT.\n Significant valvular disease not previously assessed or worsening valvular  \n dysfunction.\n Pre-conception assessment and counselling of women with significant structural  \n heart disease and a past history of HF or LV dysfunction. \n Complex congenital cardiac lesions and/or Eisenmenger’s syndrome.\nDespite taking conventional HF therapy, patients may seek alternative therapy and \nhealing approaches that are not considered as allopathic medicine. The National Centre for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) defines complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) as a group of diverse medical and healthcare interventions, practices, products or disciplines that are not generally considered part of conventional medicine.\n10.1 Enhanced External Counter Pulsation (EECP)\nThere is inadequate evidence of clinical effectiveness of EECP in HF.\n510-513 There is \nconcern that it could precipitate or exacerbate HF. \n10.2 Stem cell therapy\nA global position paper on cardiovascular regenerative medicine stated that \ncell-based therapy in HF patients is neither positive nor consistent.514 \n10.3 Omega 3 fatty acids\nIn patients with HFrEF, it may be considered as an adjunctive therapy based on a \nsingle randomised controlled trial (RCT) which showed a small benefit in CV death and/or hospitalisations.\n515,516 \nKey message 11:\n Heart Failure clinics will serve as an intermediary between in-patient  \n hospital care and community primary care.10.4 Coenzyme Q10\nThere is no convincing evidence to support or refute the use of coenzyme Q10 for \npatients with HF.517\n10.5 Tai Chi\nTai Chi may improve 6 min walk test distance, quality of life and LVEF in patients with \nHF.518,519 Its effect on hard CV outcomes such as rehospitalisation, MI and mortality \nis not known. \n10.6 YogaA meta-analysis in 2014 that includes two RCTs concluded that yoga improved peak \nVO2 (exercise capacity) and quality of life in chronic HF patients.\n520 There is an \nongoing RCT to look at the effect of yoga in HFpEF patients.521\nThe focus of future development for HF in Malaysia should be towards service \nenhancement working to meet the World Heart Federation mandate of a 25% reduction in premature non-communicable disease mortality by 2025. \nFinding the balance between costs and quality remains a global challenge, and the \nunderstanding of the disease in our healthcare context is imperative to making sure we move forward regarding service delivery, human resource allocation, medical expense costs and patient outcomes. To achieve this, the following need to be undertaken: \n Epidemiological studies to understand the disease profile in the country.\n Establishment and expansion of HFCs leading to more patient-centred HF care.\n Expanding service delivery, human resource allocation, medical expense cost  \n and patient outcomes.\n Education of healthcare personnel.\nEfforts should be directed to the knowledge and understanding of the epidemiology of HF in our country, its phenotype, presentation, current adherence to guideline-directed therapy and outcomes. Regular cluster sampling cohorts or a nationwide registry should be considered. Understanding the limitations of service delivery albeit geography or human resources and making plans for better service delivery systems \nare important.\nDevelopment of HFCs, can lead to a more patient-centric HF care. (See Section 9, Pages 110-113)\nModules for HF care need to be initiated in order to train and educate general \ninternal medicine physicians. A core-curriculum for education needs to be formed to ensure adequate training has been disseminated to HFC personnel.   \nIncentives regarding HF guidelines compliance should be implemented and HF \ninnovative practice should be encouraged with awards for best clinical practice and innovation be made available. \nThis streamline approach to HF care with engagement of connected groups hopefully \nwill help in better overall patient care and experience.\nPerformance measures should be used with the goal of improving quality of care for HF.\n518,519\nProcess performance measures focus on the aspects of care that are delivered to a patient, \nwhile outcome measures focus on the end-points such as mortality or hospitalisation.\nProcess performance indicators for in-patients with HF includes:522-524\n % of patients who had documentation of NYHA Functional Class.\n % of patients who had LVEF measurement.\n % of patients with current or prior LVEF < 40% and without contraindications  \n discharged with ACE-I/ARB. \n % of patients with current or prior LVEF < 40% and without contraindications  \n discharged on β-blockers.\n % of patients with current or prior LVEF < 40% and without contraindications  \n discharged on MRA.\n % of patients with chronic or paroxysmal AF/atrial flutter without contraindications  \n on anticoagulant therapy at discharge.\n % of patients given a post discharge appointment.\nThe accepted performance measure should be more than 60%.Outcome measures indicators include:\n In-hospital mortality\n 30-day readmission for HF\nRefer to Appendix VI, Page 121 for calculation of these measures."

        "text": "1148.5.5 CARDIO-ONCOLOGY AND HEART FAILURE\nHeart disease and cancer are often linked due to:\n Common risk factors (e.g. increasing age and cigarette smoking)\n Treatment strategies \n  Chemotherapy drugs has been associated with HF, arrhythmias,  \n  vasculitis and thromboembolic disease.\n  Radiotherapy of the mediastinum and left chest can lead to CAD,  \n  myopericardial fibrosis and valvular dysfunction.\nDyspnoea in cancer patients could be due to:\n Fluid overload.\n Cardiomyopathy due to chemotherapeutic agents, stress (Takotsubo), or  \n underlying CAD.\n The primary cancer causing anaemia, lung and pericardial involvement. \nChemotherapy-induced cardiomyopathy is not common, clinical HF occurs in \n1-5% and an asymptomatic decrease in LV function in the range of 5% to 20%.\n442 Prognosis in the patients who develop HF is poor.443\nThe anthracycline class of chemotherapeutic agents remain the major cause of chemotherapy-induced cardiomyopathy.\n444,445 In the current era, newer \nagents have also been implicated in a reversible form of cardiomyopathy.446 \nChemotherapy-induced cardiomyopathy as defined by the Cardiac Review and Evaluation Committee is the presence of at least one or more of the following:\n447\n1. Cardiomyopathy characterised by a decrease in Ejection Fraction (EF)  \n globally or due to regional changes in interventricular septum contraction. \n2. Symptoms of HF.3. Signs associated with HF including but not limited to S3 gallop, tachycardia,  \n or both.4. Decline in initial EF of at least 5% to < 55% with signs and symptoms of  \n HF or asymptomatic decrease in EF of at least 10% to < 55%.Chemotherapy drugs that have been associated with HF include (Appendix V, Page120):\n Doxorubicin \n  5% at a cumulative dose of 400mg/m2 (the higher the cumulative dose, \n  the greater the risk of HF.445  \n  Even at lower doses of 180 to 240mg/m2, subclinical events can  \n  occur in up to 30% of patients about 13 years post treatment.448\n  These suggest that there is no ‘safe’ dose for doxorubicin. \n Cyclophosphamide especially in high doses and ifosfomide.449,450  \n Newer agents such as monoclonal antibodies (trastuzumab and pertuzumab), \n small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (imatinib, sunitinib, sorafenib)  \n and the proteasome inhibitor (bortezomib).  Trastuzumab especially when administered together with anthracyclines \n  and cyclophosphamide, has been associated with an increased incidence \n  of HF of 27% compared to 1.7% to 4.1% when anthracycline was not part  \n  of the therapeutic regimen.\n451-453 Symptoms are usually mild to moderate \n  and improve following medical management and termination of drug  \n  administration. Improvement is usually seen in about 4-6 weeks after    withdrawal of the agent.\n454-456 After symptomatic improvement, \n  reinstitution  of treatment is usually possible.454-456\n  Vascular endothelial growth factor signaling pathway (VSP) inhibitors  \n  (bevacizumab) can cause hypertension. Bevacizumab also blocks  \n  receptors that are involved in the compensatory response to stress in  \n  the cardiomyocytes and when the heart is unable to compensate for  \n  the hypertension, it could lead to HF.457,458 Maintaining good blood pressure \n  control can prevent HF associated with this agent. Heart failure due to  \n  VSP inhibitors is usually reversible with cessation of the agent.459\nOne must consider both the efficacy and the toxicity in choosing chemotherapeutic agents. Many of the newer targeted agents cause a reversible form of HF and symptoms usually resolve after the initiation of anti-failure medications.\n454-456,459,460 \nRisk factors for anthracycline toxicity include: 461-465\n The total cumulative dose\n Intravenous bolus administration versus infusion\n Higher single doses\n History of prior irradiation\n Use of concomitant agents known to have cardiotoxicity\n Female gender\n Underlying CV disease\n Age (young and elderly)\n An increase in cardiac biomarkers such as troponins during and   after administration is an indication of toxicity.8.5.5.1 Management\n Patients undergoing chemotherapy should have a careful clinical evaluation \n and assessment and treatment of CV risk factors.464,465\n Blood pressure control is important in all patients especially in those  \n being considered for VSP inhibitors.\n All patients with potential cardiotoxic chemotherapy should have an  \n echocardiogram prior to treatment. An important parameter is the LVEF  \n determined using the biplane method of discs (Simpson’s method) or  \n three-dimensional echocardiography where available. Newer techniques   to detect and quantitate regional and global myocardial dysfunction  \n (strain assessment with global longitudinal strain) can be used to detect  \n pre-clinical and subtle changes in function.\n466-469 \n Biomarkers such as troponin and natriuretic peptides can help identify  \n patients at higher risk.462,463,470,471 \nClose collaboration between the oncologist and the cardiologist is important. \nFor the oncologists, the strategy (prior to commencement) includes:465\n Identifying high risk patients (pre-existing heart disease, presence of  \n CV risk factors, age - young and old, female gender, use of high dose  \n anthracycline regimens).\n High risk patients should:\n  Have a pre-treatment cardiac function evaluation. If the LVEF is < 50%,  \n  refer to the cardiologist.  Be considered for non-cardiotoxic alternatives. \n  Have their therapy protocols adjusted where necessary (e.g. reduction \n  in doses, continuous infusions rather than bolus injections, liposomal    doxorubicin, dexrazoxane etc). \nFor the cardiologists/general physicians, the strategy includes:\n Treating CV risk factors. \n Assessing, repeating (if necessary) imaging studies. (e.g. using high  \n quality LVEF measurement, strain evaluation etc).\n Assessing cardiac biomarkers (troponin and/or NP).\n Considering cardio-protection prior to/or during treatment using β-blockers,  \n MRA and/or ACE-I/ARB if:69,465,472-474\n  EF < 50%, \n  EF drops by > 10%\n  Abnormal global longitudinal strain (GLS) (> 15% drop).  Monitoring LVEF during therapy is important with repeat echocardiography  \n at 3-monthly intervals and/or according to symptoms. If cardioprotective  \n medications are given, monitoring may be necessary at closer intervals of  \n time depending on the clinical condition of the patient e.g. 1-monthly interval. \n Withholding cardiotoxic therapy only as a last resort. (for anthracycline  \n LVEF < 45%, for anti-HER2 therapy LVEF < 40%).\n Monitoring even after completion of therapy:\n  Obtain post therapy LVEF.\n  Repeat echocardiography in 6 months or 1 year. Most cases of  \n  treatment-associated cardiac dysfunction develop within the first year  \n  after completion of therapy.475,476 \n  If EF remains abnormal, follow guidelines for management of HF.465 \n \n8.5.6 HEART FAILURE AND KIDNEY DYSFUNCTION\n8.5.6.1 Epidemiology, definitions and classifications Cardiac and pre-existing kidney disease at admission frequently co-exist, \nvarying from 45.4% in patients with chronic HF to > 60% in those with AHF.\n477,478 \nIn addition, during treatment of AHF, a significant proportion of patients will develop varying degrees of worsening renal function (WRF).\nThe definition of WRF is:\n479\n An increase in serum creatinine by ≥ 26.5μmol/ L (0.3mg/dl) and/or\n A ≥ 25% increase in serum creatinine or a ≥ 20% drop in eGFR.\nThe rise in serum creatinine usually occurs in the first three to five days of \nhospitalisation. The incidence of WRF is estimated to be between 19 and 45%.165 This large \nobserved range is due to variations in the definitions of WRF, the observed time-at-risk and the study population.\n165 \nRisk factors for WRF during admission for HF include:480\n A prior history of HF or diabetes, \n An admission serum creatinine of > 133μmol/L,  or \n Systolic blood pressure > 160mmHg. \nWRF may fulfill criteria for type 1 or type 2 cardiorenal syndrome (CRS). The term “cardiorenal syndrome” refers to disorders of the heart and kidneys whereby acute or chronic dysfunction in one organ may induce acute or chronic dysfunction of the other.\n165 \nThis syndrome has been classified by the Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative working group into 5 subtypes as shown in Table 17, Page 105.\n165 Many \npatients however, may belong to more than one subtype and may move between subtypes during the course of their disease.\n165\n8.5.6.2. Pathogenesis of CRS \nMultiple mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of CRS. These include:\n Increased renal venous pressure  - venous congestion is probably the  \n most important factor.481 \n RV dysfunction.\n Reduced renal perfusion with reduced cardiac output. \n Neurohumoral adaptations (e.g. activation of the sympathetic nervous  \n system and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, increases in  \n vasopressin and endothelin-1).8.5.6.3  Clinical significance /Impact of kidney dysfunction in HF  The combination of cardiac and kidney disease increases the complexity and \ncosts of care, and may interact to worsen prognosis. \nA. Pharmacologic considerations \n Safety:\n  Dosing of renally-excreted cardiac drugs need adjustment in the  \n  presence of renal impairment (e.g. digoxin, insulin, low molecular  \n  weight heparin).\n  Patients with HF are at increased risk of contrast-induced acute kidney \n  injury. \n Efficacy:\n  Impaired renal function will affect drug choices and dosing. If eGFR <  \n  30mls/min/1.73m2, most thiazide diuretics are no longer effective and  \n  loop diuretics are preferred. Higher doses of loop diuretics may be   \n  required with increasing renal impairment.             B. Prognostic implications\n Preexisting CKD is a bad prognostic indicator in patients with HF - the  \n more severe the CKD, the worse the mortality.482,483\n In patients with HF, WRF may not always indicate a poor outcome.484 The  \n prognostic value of WRF is mainly determined by:   The presence of persistent congestion  \n  Baseline renal function and magnitude of renal changes \n  Duration - persistent WRF is usually associated with hemodynamic  \n  derangements and poor prognosis as compared with transient WRF  \n  as a result of agressive decongestive therapy.485-487\nTable 17: Classification of Cardiorenal Syndrome (CRS)8.5.6.4. Management \n A multi-disciplinary approach is recommended. Early referral to a  \n nephrologist is advisable.   \n Exclude potentially reversible causes for increasing renal dysfunction  \n such as hyper - or hypovolaemia, concomitant medications such as  \n aminoglycosides and NSAIDs, ACE-I or ARB and renal artery stenosis. \n Closely monitor electrolytes and kidney function, especially during acute  \n illnesses, dehydration and when increasing doses of cardiac drugs  \n including diuretics. The baseline renal function will determine how frequently \n this should be done. \n The recommended range for serum potassium is 4-5.5mmol/L.488 \n Wherever possible, avoid nephrotoxins, e.g. contrast media for angiography\n Intravenous diuretics \n  Loop diuretics are the first choice.\n  Continuous infusion may not have greater benefits compared with  \n  bolus dosing.115-118,489\n  Start initially with 2-2.5 times the usual oral dose. \n  Combination therapy (loop diuretic and thiazide/thiazide-like diuretic/\n  mineralocorticoid) may be required to enhance diuresis.205-207 However,  \n  care is required to avoid electrolyte disturbances, hypovolaemia and  \n  worsening renal dysfunction. \n Careful use of Renin Angiotensin System (RAS) blockers  \n  HF patients with stable, chronic mild-moderate renal insufficiency  \n  (eGFR > 30mls/min/1.73m2) should receive standard therapy with an  \n  ACE-I/ ARB and an MRA.490\n  A serum creatinine rise or GFR decrease by up to 30% from baseline  \n  may be acceptable before it becomes necessary to consider stopping  \n  or decreasing doses.221 \n  In patients with advanced renal failure, the decision to start or stop  \n  RAS blockers should be individualised.490\n  Consider withholding RAS blockers during aggressive diuresis in  \n  patients at high risk for WRF.  RAS blockers (and β-blockers) can be used in patients with HF who  \n  are on chronic dialysis therapy.\n Ultrafiltration \n  This involves the removal of plasma water across a semi-permeable  \n  membrane in response to a transmembrane pressure gradient.   It may be considered for congestive symptoms refractory to diuresis,  \n  but should be used in consultation with a nephrologist.\n491\n  Evidence for its efficacy in fluid removal is mixed at present.491  Haemodialysis \n  Criteria for possible need to initiate renal replacement therapy include:\n   Oliguria unresponsive to fluid resuscitation.\n   Severe hyperkalaemia (serum potassium > 6.5mmol/L).\n   Severe acidaemia (pH < 7.2). \n   Serum urea > 25mmol/L. \n    Serum creatinine > 300μmol/L. \n8.6  ADVANCED HEART FAILURE/REFRACTORY HEART FAILURE\nThese are patients with severe symptoms of HF despite maximal medical \ntherapy. Hospital admission is necessary for stabilisation. Meticulous control of fluid balance is important. Aggravating causes of HF as listed in Table 5, Page 39 should be identified and treated.\nThese patients may need specialised treatment in CCU or ICU. The following \nmay be required:\n Intravenous infusion of frusemide. These patients may require combination  \n loop diuretics and thiazides.\n Intravenous infusion of inotropes - low dose dobutamine (5mcg/kg/min) or  \n milrinone. These improve symptoms but no survival benefit has been  \n demonstrated.126,492\n Ultrafiltration in patients who are fluid overloaded.493 In most patients,  \n however, the relief is temporary.\nThe prognosis of these patients is poor. They should be referred to assess \nwhether they may be potential candidates for mechanical circulatory support (e.g. LVAD) and consideration for heart transplant.\n8.6.1 HEART TRANSPLANTHeart transplantation is a well-established treatment of refractory end stage \nHF. This definitive therapy for HF however is limited by the lack of donor organs.\n494,495All patients with severe symptomatic HF despite optimal medical therapy and no other alternative therapy option should be considered for heart transplant. They need to be referred to a HF specialist cardiac hospital for further evaluation.\nAssessment for heart transplant is done by a multispeciality, multidisciplinary \nteam and appropriate work up will be performed for eligibility.\nEligibility criteria to be considered for heart transplant include:\n Poor LVEF (< 25%).\n Recurrent HF hospitalisations.\n Major limitation of the patient’s daily activities.\n Poor effort tolerance i.e. peak VO2 (maximal oxygen consumption or  \n peak oxygen uptake) less than 10ml/kg/min (or < 50% predicted). VO2  \n max is the maximum rate of oxygen consumption measured during  \n incremental exercise ie exercise of increasing intensity and is widely  \n used as an indicator of cardiorespiratory fitness.\n Intravenous inotropic dependence for symptomatic relief or to maintain  \n end organ function.\n Motivated, psychologically stable and compliant to therapy.\nContraindications to heart transplant\n Active infection.\n Severe peripheral arterial or cerebrovascular disease.\n Malignancy within 5 years.\n Diabetes mellitus with widespread microvascular complications.\n Systemic disease with multi-organ dysfunction.\n Irreversible chronic kidney, liver or lung disease.\n Pharmacologically irreversible pulmonary hypertension.\n Other medical or psychosocial issues that would impact survival.\n8.6.2 MECHANICAL CIRCULATORY SUPPORT The use of mechanical circulatory support (e.g. LVAD), should be considered \nfor patients with potentially reversible or treatable conditions or as a bridge to heart transplant in suitable candidates.\nLVAD may also be used as destination therapy in candidates who are not \nsuitable for transplant. Patients have improvement in their symptoms when compared to optimal medical therapy.\n496,497 However, the rate of rehospitalisations \ndue to complications of bleeding, thrombosis and infections are high.496-498 \nMany patients also go into major depression. Thus, extensive discussion with the patient and family is necessary prior to LVAD implantation.8.7 PALLIATIVE AND END OF LIFE CARE\nDespite recent advances in therapy, for some patients, HF remains a \nprogressive disease and carries a poor prognosis. Patients with refractory symptoms despite guideline-directed medical therapy, should be considered for palliative and end of life care if they have the following characteristics:\n499\n Progressive functional decline (mental and physical) and dependence in  \n most activities of daily living.\n Severe HF symptoms with poor quality of life despite optimal pharmacological \n and non-pharmacological therapies.\n Frequent hospital admissions or serious episodes of decompensation  \n despite optimal therapies.\n Heart transplantation and mechanical circulatory support ruled out.\n Cardiac cachexia.\n Clinically judged to be near end of life.\nThe aim of palliative care in HF is to prevent and relieve suffering and to promote the best quality of life for patients and their families.\n500\nDespite the complexities of end-of-life issues in HF patients, there is minimal evidence-based guidance on the care of this population.\n501 The key components \nof end-of-life care are:\n 1. Advanced care plan with directives and informed decisions on:\n   Use or withdrawal of treatment including advanced therapies such  \n   as V inotropes, ICD and mechanical circulatory support. \n   When it would be appropriate to switch off devices such as ICD or  \n   CRT. \n   Resuscitation status.\n   Preferred location of death (i.e. at home or hospital).\n 2. Symptom management \n  Goals of care at this stage should shift from extending life to controlling \n  symptoms and maximising quality of life. Common symptoms include:\n   Dyspnoea\n   Fatigue\n   Pain\n   Urinary retention \n  Constipation\n  Cachexia\n  Depression\n Medications that may be useful include analgesics, antiemetics, anxiolytics,  \n opioids, laxatives, and diuretics, etc. \n3. Psychosocial support\n The impact of HF on quality of life for the patient and family is complex and  \n extends beyond physical symptoms.502\n Emotional, spiritual and social support should be provided to alleviate patient  \n anxiety about dying, and to guide patient towards a peaceful journey at the end  \n of life.\n9.1 LEVEL OF CARE AND SHARED MANAGEMENT \nThe care of patients with HF should ideally take place in a multidisciplinary system, \nallowing for shared care between the hospital (secondary or tertiary settings) and \ncommunity (primary setting). A multidisciplinary approach encompasses patient \neducation, cardiac rehabilitation, psychosocial support and palliative care, and has been proven to reduce HF hospitalisations and mortality in discharged patients.\n503-505\nThe multidisciplinary team usually consists of cardiologists and or general physicians, HF nurses, pharmacists, dieticians, physiotherapists, primary care \nproviders, social workers as well as geriatricians, psychologists, occupational \ntherapists and when necessary, palliative care specialists. Care can be done in two different settings: \n In the patient’s own home - home-based interventions are associated with  \n significantly lower healthcare costs, reduced hospital readmissions and an  \n improvement in the patient’s quality of life.506 This may however, not be feasible  \n in our local setting.\n Specialist outpatient clinic - the Heart Failure Clinic (HFC). \nHFCs can either be:\n Nurse-directed - these are run by nurses with special training in HF.\n Physician-directed - run by general physicians and/or cardiologists. \nHFCs can be established in the tertiary hospitals or in the primary care setting. The minimum human resource requirements are a:\n Cardiologist or general physician with an interest in cardiology and HF, \n Dedicated nurse and \n Medical technologist for blood taking, doing echocardiography and 6 minutes \n walk tests.In bigger clinic settings, the involvement of physiotherapists to encourage physical \nactivity, pharmacists and counsellors for end of life care would be advisable.\nThese clinics will be the intermediary between in-patient hospital care and community \nprimary care. Patients who can be seen in these clinics include those:507\n Recently discharged after an admission for decompensated HF (a waiting \n time of 7-12 days post discharge has to be the maximum wait-time).\n Who are in the early decompensation phase and need treatment modification.\n Who are stable but need uptitration of HF medications.\n With ICD or CRTs. \n With comorbidities, such as renal dysfunction, diabetes and COPD.\n With advanced HF who may benefit from:\n  Heart transplant\n  Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD)\n  Palliative care.\nThe objectives of these HF clinics may vary based on local settings. These include:\n507,508\n Optimisation of medical therapy particularly the uptitration of β-blockers, ACE-I  \n and MRA. \n Education of the patient and caregiver on the nature of the disease and its  \n progression. \n Promotion of self-care such as :\n  Compliance to medical therapy and fluid restriction.\n  Regular weighing and adjusting diuretic doses according to symptoms and  \n  body weight.\nPatient with optimised HF medications/treatment plans can be discharged to the \ncommunity with appropriate care plans to primary care. Close partnership between these HF clinics and primary care helps to reduce unnecessary admissions to hospital. \nIn 2018, the Heart Failure Medication Therapy Adherence Clinic (MTAC) was \nintroduced. These clinics are conducted by pharmacists in collaboration with doctors and other healthcare providers to improve HF management. The objectives of the Heart Failure MTAC are:\n509\n Enhance patient’s adherence to HF pharmacotherapy and non-pharmacological  \n interventions.\n To reduce unscheduled emergency department visits or hospitalisations of HF  \n patient due to acute decompensation.\n To provide consultative service to doctors on evidence-based HF pharmacotherapy  \n and related issues.\n To collaborate with doctors and other health care professionals in HF management  \n program.9.2 MONITORING AND FOLLOW-UP \nPatients with HF require regular follow-up and monitoring. Serial evaluations serve \nto assess a patient’s status, response to therapy, development of complications and disease progression. Key components of assessment include:\n Functional capacity - NYHA functional class or 6-minute walk test \n Fluid status and body weight \n Blood pressure, heart rate and rhythm \n Examination of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems\n Cognitive status and nutritional status \n Review of pharmacotherapy - uptitration, compliance and side effects\n Serum urea, electrolytes, creatinine and eGFR as necessary\n Diet and sodium intake\n Consumption of alcohol or illicit drugs\n Smoking history.\nThe frequency of follow-up will depend on the patient’s clinical stability and need for pharmacotherapy optimisation. A patient with a recent episode of decompensation or clinical instability, for instance, should ideally be seen again soon, usually within 2 weeks. Ultimately, the intensity and type of follow-up would be determined by the local organisation of care and resources.\nRoutine serial echocardiogram is not recommended. However, if there has been a \nrecent change in clinical status or if the patient has received treatment that might significantly change certain echocardiographic parameters, a follow-up echocardiogram is reasonable to assess the LVEF and structural remodeling.\nSerial brain natriuretic peptide measurements to guide and tailor HF therapy cannot \nbe broadly recommended at the present time due to a lack of consistent evidence.\n29-32 \n9.3 CARDIOLOGY REFERRAL \nHF patients with stable symptoms may be managed at the primary care level. \nReferral to the cardiologist should be considered in the following situations: \n De novo HF for a comprehensive workup to confirm the diagnosis and determine  \n the aetiology, and to devise a management plan.\n Episodes of acute decompensation.\n Worsening HF symptoms despite appropriate therapy. \n HF complicated with symptomatic hypotension or excessive bradycardia, limiting \n uptitration of pharmacotherapy. Symptomatic stable CAD and/or acute coronary syndrome for consideration of  \n revascularisation (PCI or CABG). \n Resuscitated cardiac arrest.\n Documented or suspected significant arrhythmias e.g. AF, VT.\n Significant valvular disease not previously assessed or worsening valvular  \n dysfunction.\n Pre-conception assessment and counselling of women with significant structural  \n heart disease and a past history of HF or LV dysfunction. \n Complex congenital cardiac lesions and/or Eisenmenger’s syndrome.\nDespite taking conventional HF therapy, patients may seek alternative therapy and healing approaches that are not considered as allopathic medicine. The National Centre for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) defines complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) as a group of diverse medical and healthcare interventions, practices, products or disciplines that are not generally considered part of conventional medicine.\n10.1 Enhanced External Counter Pulsation (EECP)\nThere is inadequate evidence of clinical effectiveness of EECP in HF.\n510-513 There is \nconcern that it could precipitate or exacerbate HF. \n10.2 Stem cell therapy\nA global position paper on cardiovascular regenerative medicine stated that \ncell-based therapy in HF patients is neither positive nor consistent.514 \n10.3 Omega 3 fatty acids\nIn patients with HFrEF, it may be considered as an adjunctive therapy based on a \nsingle randomised controlled trial (RCT) which showed a small benefit in CV death and/or hospitalisations.\n515,516 10.4 Coenzyme Q10\nThere is no convincing evidence to support or refute the use of coenzyme Q10 for \npatients with HF.517\n10.5 Tai Chi\nTai Chi may improve 6 min walk test distance, quality of life and LVEF in patients with \nHF.518,519 Its effect on hard CV outcomes such as rehospitalisation, MI and mortality \nis not known. \n10.6 YogaA meta-analysis in 2014 that includes two RCTs concluded that yoga improved peak \nVO2 (exercise capacity) and quality of life in chronic HF patients.\n520 There is an \nongoing RCT to look at the effect of yoga in HFpEF patients.521\nThe focus of future development for HF in Malaysia should be towards service \nenhancement working to meet the World Heart Federation mandate of a 25% reduction in premature non-communicable disease mortality by 2025. \nFinding the balance between costs and quality remains a global challenge, and the \nunderstanding of the disease in our healthcare context is imperative to making sure we move forward regarding service delivery, human resource allocation, medical expense costs and patient outcomes. To achieve this, the following need to be undertaken: \n Epidemiological studies to understand the disease profile in the country.\n Establishment and expansion of HFCs leading to more patient-centred HF care.\n Expanding service delivery, human resource allocation, medical expense cost  \n and patient outcomes.\n Education of healthcare personnel.\nEfforts should be directed to the knowledge and understanding of the epidemiology of HF in our country, its phenotype, presentation, current adherence to guideline-directed therapy and outcomes. Regular cluster sampling cohorts or a nationwide registry should be considered. Understanding the limitations of service delivery albeit geography or human resources and making plans for better service delivery systems \nare important.\nDevelopment of HFCs, can lead to a more patient-centric HF care. (See Section 9, Pages 110-113)\nModules for HF care need to be initiated in order to train and educate general \ninternal medicine physicians. A core-curriculum for education needs to be formed to ensure adequate training has been disseminated to HFC personnel.   \nIncentives regarding HF guidelines compliance should be implemented and HF \ninnovative practice should be encouraged with awards for best clinical practice and innovation be made available. \nThis streamline approach to HF care with engagement of connected groups hopefully \nwill help in better overall patient care and experience.\nPerformance measures should be used with the goal of improving quality of care for HF.\n518,519\nProcess performance measures focus on the aspects of care that are delivered to a patient, \nwhile outcome measures focus on the end-points such as mortality or hospitalisation.\nProcess performance indicators for in-patients with HF includes:522-524\n % of patients who had documentation of NYHA Functional Class.\n % of patients who had LVEF measurement.\n % of patients with current or prior LVEF < 40% and without contraindications  \n discharged with ACE-I/ARB. \n % of patients with current or prior LVEF < 40% and without contraindications  \n discharged on β-blockers.\n % of patients with current or prior LVEF < 40% and without contraindications  \n discharged on MRA.\n % of patients with chronic or paroxysmal AF/atrial flutter without contraindications  \n on anticoagulant therapy at discharge.\n % of patients given a post discharge appointment.\nThe accepted performance measure should be more than 60%.Outcome measures indicators include:\n In-hospital mortality\n 30-day readmission for HF\nRefer to Appendix VI, Page 121 for calculation of these measures.\n11.

Cardiomyopathy characterised by a decrease in Ejection Fraction (EF)  \n globally or due to regional changes in interventricular septum contraction. \n2. Symptoms of HF.3. Signs associated with HF including but not limited to S3 gallop, tachycardia,  \n or both.4. Decline in initial EF of at least 5% to < 55% with signs and symptoms of  \n HF or asymptomatic decrease in EF of at least 10% to < 55%.Chemotherapy drugs that have been associated with HF include (Appendix V, Page120):\n Doxorubicin \n  5% at a cumulative dose of 400mg/m2 (the higher the cumulative dose, \n  the greater the risk of HF.445  \n  Even at lower doses of 180 to 240mg/m2, subclinical events can  \n  occur in up to 30% of patients about 13 years post treatment.448\n  These suggest that there is no ‘safe’ dose for doxorubicin. \n Cyclophosphamide especially in high doses and ifosfomide.449,450  \n Newer agents such as monoclonal antibodies (trastuzumab and pertuzumab), \n small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (imatinib, sunitinib, sorafenib)  \n and the proteasome inhibitor (bortezomib).  Trastuzumab especially when administered together with anthracyclines \n  and cyclophosphamide, has been associated with an increased incidence \n  of HF of 27% compared to 1.7% to 4.1% when anthracycline was not part  \n  of the therapeutic regimen.\n451-453 Symptoms are usually mild to moderate \n  and improve following medical management and termination of drug  \n  administration. Improvement is usually seen in about 4-6 weeks after    withdrawal of the agent.\n454-456 After symptomatic improvement, \n  reinstitution  of treatment is usually possible.454-456\n  Vascular endothelial growth factor signaling pathway (VSP) inhibitors  \n  (bevacizumab) can cause hypertension. Bevacizumab also blocks  \n  receptors that are involved in the compensatory response to stress in  \n  the cardiomyocytes and when the heart is unable to compensate for  \n  the hypertension, it could lead to HF.457,458 Maintaining good blood pressure \n  control can prevent HF associated with this agent. Heart failure due to  \n  VSP inhibitors is usually reversible with cessation of the agent.459\nOne must consider both the efficacy and the toxicity in choosing chemotherapeutic agents. Many of the newer targeted agents cause a reversible form of HF and symptoms usually resolve after the initiation of anti-failure medications.\n454-456,459,460 \nRisk factors for anthracycline toxicity include: 461-465\n The total cumulative dose\n Intravenous bolus administration versus infusion\n Higher single doses\n History of prior irradiation\n Use of concomitant agents known to have cardiotoxicity\n Female gender\n Underlying CV disease\n Age (young and elderly)\n An increase in cardiac biomarkers such as troponins during and   after administration is an indication of toxicity.8.5.5.1 Management\n Patients undergoing chemotherapy should have a careful clinical evaluation \n and assessment and treatment of CV risk factors.464,465\n Blood pressure control is important in all patients especially in those  \n being considered for VSP inhibitors.\n All patients with potential cardiotoxic chemotherapy should have an  \n echocardiogram prior to treatment. An important parameter is the LVEF  \n determined using the biplane method of discs (Simpson’s method) or  \n three-dimensional echocardiography where available. Newer techniques   to detect and quantitate regional and global myocardial dysfunction  \n (strain assessment with global longitudinal strain) can be used to detect  \n pre-clinical and subtle changes in function.\n466-469 \n Biomarkers such as troponin and natriuretic peptides can help identify  \n patients at higher risk.462,463,470,471 \nClose collaboration between the oncologist and the cardiologist is important. \nFor the oncologists, the strategy (prior to commencement) includes:465\n Identifying high risk patients (pre-existing heart disease, presence of  \n CV risk factors, age - young and old, female gender, use of high dose  \n anthracycline regimens).\n High risk patients should:\n  Have a pre-treatment cardiac function evaluation. If the LVEF is < 50%,  \n  refer to the cardiologist.  Be considered for non-cardiotoxic alternatives. \n  Have their therapy protocols adjusted where necessary (e.g. reduction \n  in doses, continuous infusions rather than bolus injections, liposomal    doxorubicin, dexrazoxane etc). \nFor the cardiologists/general physicians, the strategy includes:\n Treating CV risk factors. \n Assessing, repeating (if necessary) imaging studies. (e.g. using high  \n quality LVEF measurement, strain evaluation etc).\n Assessing cardiac biomarkers (troponin and/or NP).\n Considering cardio-protection prior to/or during treatment using β-blockers,  \n MRA and/or ACE-I/ARB if:69,465,472-474\n  EF < 50%, \n  EF drops by > 10%\n  Abnormal global longitudinal strain (GLS) (> 15% drop).  Monitoring LVEF during therapy is important with repeat echocardiography  \n at 3-monthly intervals and/or according to symptoms. If cardioprotective  \n medications are given, monitoring may be necessary at closer intervals of  \n time depending on the clinical condition of the patient e.g. 1-monthly interval. \n Withholding cardiotoxic therapy only as a last resort. (for anthracycline  \n LVEF < 45%, for anti-HER2 therapy LVEF < 40%).\n Monitoring even after completion of therapy:\n  Obtain post therapy LVEF.\n  Repeat echocardiography in 6 months or 1 year. Most cases of  \n  treatment-associated cardiac dysfunction develop within the first year  \n  after completion of therapy.475,476 \n  If EF remains abnormal, follow guidelines for management of HF.465 \n \n8.5.6 HEART FAILURE AND KIDNEY DYSFUNCTION\n8.5.6.1 Epidemiology, definitions and classifications Cardiac and pre-existing kidney disease at admission frequently co-exist, \nvarying from 45.4% in patients with chronic HF to > 60% in those with AHF.\n477,478 \nIn addition, during treatment of AHF, a significant proportion of patients will develop varying degrees of worsening renal function (WRF).\nThe definition of WRF is:\n479\n An increase in serum creatinine by ≥ 26.5μmol/ L (0.3mg/dl) and/or\n A ≥ 25% increase in serum creatinine or a ≥ 20% drop in eGFR.\nThe rise in serum creatinine usually occurs in the first three to five days of \nhospitalisation. The incidence of WRF is estimated to be between 19 and 45%.165 This large \nobserved range is due to variations in the definitions of WRF, the observed time-at-risk and the study population.\n165 \nRisk factors for WRF during admission for HF include:480\n A prior history of HF or diabetes, \n An admission serum creatinine of > 133μmol/L,  or \n Systolic blood pressure > 160mmHg. \nWRF may fulfill criteria for type 1 or type 2 cardiorenal syndrome (CRS). The term “cardiorenal syndrome” refers to disorders of the heart and kidneys whereby acute or chronic dysfunction in one organ may induce acute or chronic dysfunction of the other.\n165 \nThis syndrome has been classified by the Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative working group into 5 subtypes as shown in Table 17, Page 105.\n165 Many \npatients however, may belong to more than one subtype and may move between subtypes during the course of their disease.\n165\n8.5.6.2. Pathogenesis of CRS \nMultiple mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of CRS. These include:\n Increased renal venous pressure  - venous congestion is probably the  \n most important factor.481 \n RV dysfunction.\n Reduced renal perfusion with reduced cardiac output. \n Neurohumoral adaptations (e.g. activation of the sympathetic nervous  \n system and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, increases in  \n vasopressin and endothelin-1).8.5.6.3  Clinical significance /Impact of kidney dysfunction in HF  The combination of cardiac and kidney disease increases the complexity and \ncosts of care, and may interact to worsen prognosis. \nA. Pharmacologic considerations \n Safety:\n  Dosing of renally-excreted cardiac drugs need adjustment in the  \n  presence of renal impairment (e.g. digoxin, insulin, low molecular  \n  weight heparin).\n  Patients with HF are at increased risk of contrast-induced acute kidney \n  injury. \n Efficacy:\n  Impaired renal function will affect drug choices and dosing. If eGFR <  \n  30mls/min/1.73m2, most thiazide diuretics are no longer effective and  \n  loop diuretics are preferred. Higher doses of loop diuretics may be   \n  required with increasing renal impairment.             B. Prognostic implications\n Preexisting CKD is a bad prognostic indicator in patients with HF - the  \n more severe the CKD, the worse the mortality.482,483\n In patients with HF, WRF may not always indicate a poor outcome.484 The  \n prognostic value of WRF is mainly determined by:   The presence of persistent congestion  \n  Baseline renal function and magnitude of renal changes \n  Duration - persistent WRF is usually associated with hemodynamic  \n  derangements and poor prognosis as compared with transient WRF  \n  as a result of agressive decongestive therapy.485-487\nTable 17: Classification of Cardiorenal Syndrome (CRS)8.5.6.4. Management \n A multi-disciplinary approach is recommended. Early referral to a  \n nephrologist is advisable.   \n Exclude potentially reversible causes for increasing renal dysfunction  \n such as hyper - or hypovolaemia, concomitant medications such as  \n aminoglycosides and NSAIDs, ACE-I or ARB and renal artery stenosis. \n Closely monitor electrolytes and kidney function, especially during acute  \n illnesses, dehydration and when increasing doses of cardiac drugs  \n including diuretics. The baseline renal function will determine how frequently \n this should be done. \n The recommended range for serum potassium is 4-5.5mmol/L.488 \n Wherever possible, avoid nephrotoxins, e.g. contrast media for angiography\n Intravenous diuretics \n  Loop diuretics are the first choice.\n  Continuous infusion may not have greater benefits compared with  \n  bolus dosing.115-118,489\n  Start initially with 2-2.5 times the usual oral dose. \n  Combination therapy (loop diuretic and thiazide/thiazide-like diuretic/\n  mineralocorticoid) may be required to enhance diuresis.205-207 However,  \n  care is required to avoid electrolyte disturbances, hypovolaemia and  \n  worsening renal dysfunction. \n Careful use of Renin Angiotensin System (RAS) blockers  \n  HF patients with stable, chronic mild-moderate renal insufficiency  \n  (eGFR > 30mls/min/1.73m2) should receive standard therapy with an  \n  ACE-I/ ARB and an MRA.490\n  A serum creatinine rise or GFR decrease by up to 30% from baseline  \n  may be acceptable before it becomes necessary to consider stopping  \n  or decreasing doses.221 \n  In patients with advanced renal failure, the decision to start or stop  \n  RAS blockers should be individualised.490\n  Consider withholding RAS blockers during aggressive diuresis in  \n  patients at high risk for WRF.  RAS blockers (and β-blockers) can be used in patients with HF who  \n  are on chronic dialysis therapy.\n Ultrafiltration \n  This involves the removal of plasma water across a semi-permeable  \n  membrane in response to a transmembrane pressure gradient.   It may be considered for congestive symptoms refractory to diuresis,  \n  but should be used in consultation with a nephrologist.\n491\n  Evidence for its efficacy in fluid removal is mixed at present.491  Haemodialysis \n  Criteria for possible need to initiate renal replacement therapy include:\n   Oliguria unresponsive to fluid resuscitation.\n   Severe hyperkalaemia (serum potassium > 6.5mmol/L).\n   Severe acidaemia (pH < 7.2). \n   Serum urea > 25mmol/L. \n    Serum creatinine > 300μmol/L. \n8.6  ADVANCED HEART FAILURE/REFRACTORY HEART FAILURE\nThese are patients with severe symptoms of HF despite maximal medical \ntherapy. Hospital admission is necessary for stabilisation. Meticulous control of fluid balance is important. Aggravating causes of HF as listed in Table 5, Page 39 should be identified and treated.\nThese patients may need specialised treatment in CCU or ICU. The following \nmay be required:\n Intravenous infusion of frusemide. These patients may require combination  \n loop diuretics and thiazides.\n Intravenous infusion of inotropes - low dose dobutamine (5mcg/kg/min) or  \n milrinone. These improve symptoms but no survival benefit has been  \n demonstrated.126,492\n Ultrafiltration in patients who are fluid overloaded.493 In most patients,  \n however, the relief is temporary.\nThe prognosis of these patients is poor. They should be referred to assess \nwhether they may be potential candidates for mechanical circulatory support (e.g. LVAD) and consideration for heart transplant.\n8.6.1 HEART TRANSPLANTHeart transplantation is a well-established treatment of refractory end stage \nHF. This definitive therapy for HF however is limited by the lack of donor organs.\n494,495All patients with severe symptomatic HF despite optimal medical therapy and no other alternative therapy option should be considered for heart transplant. They need to be referred to a HF specialist cardiac hospital for further evaluation.\nAssessment for heart transplant is done by a multispeciality, multidisciplinary \nteam and appropriate work up will be performed for eligibility.\nEligibility criteria to be considered for heart transplant include:\n Poor LVEF (< 25%).\n Recurrent HF hospitalisations.\n Major limitation of the patient’s daily activities.\n Poor effort tolerance i.e. peak VO2 (maximal oxygen consumption or  \n peak oxygen uptake) less than 10ml/kg/min (or < 50% predicted). VO2  \n max is the maximum rate of oxygen consumption measured during  \n incremental exercise ie exercise of increasing intensity and is widely  \n used as an indicator of cardiorespiratory fitness.\n Intravenous inotropic dependence for symptomatic relief or to maintain  \n end organ function.\n Motivated, psychologically stable and compliant to therapy.\nContraindications to heart transplant\n Active infection.\n Severe peripheral arterial or cerebrovascular disease.\n Malignancy within 5 years.\n Diabetes mellitus with widespread microvascular complications.\n Systemic disease with multi-organ dysfunction.\n Irreversible chronic kidney, liver or lung disease.\n Pharmacologically irreversible pulmonary hypertension.\n Other medical or psychosocial issues that would impact survival.\n8.6.2 MECHANICAL CIRCULATORY SUPPORT The use of mechanical circulatory support (e.g. LVAD), should be considered \nfor patients with potentially reversible or treatable conditions or as a bridge to heart transplant in suitable candidates.\nLVAD may also be used as destination therapy in candidates who are not \nsuitable for transplant. Patients have improvement in their symptoms when compared to optimal medical therapy.\n496,497 However, the rate of rehospitalisations \ndue to complications of bleeding, thrombosis and infections are high.496-498 \nMany patients also go into major depression. Thus, extensive discussion with the patient and family is necessary prior to LVAD implantation.8.7 PALLIATIVE AND END OF LIFE CARE\nDespite recent advances in therapy, for some patients, HF remains a \nprogressive disease and carries a poor prognosis. Patients with refractory symptoms despite guideline-directed medical therapy, should be considered for palliative and end of life care if they have the following characteristics:\n499\n Progressive functional decline (mental and physical) and dependence in  \n most activities of daily living.\n Severe HF symptoms with poor quality of life despite optimal pharmacological \n and non-pharmacological therapies.\n Frequent hospital admissions or serious episodes of decompensation  \n despite optimal therapies.\n Heart transplantation and mechanical circulatory support ruled out.\n Cardiac cachexia.\n Clinically judged to be near end of life.\nThe aim of palliative care in HF is to prevent and relieve suffering and to promote the best quality of life for patients and their families.\n500\nDespite the complexities of end-of-life issues in HF patients, there is minimal evidence-based guidance on the care of this population.\n501 The key components \nof end-of-life care are:\n 1. Advanced care plan with directives and informed decisions on:\n   Use or withdrawal of treatment including advanced therapies such  \n   as V inotropes, ICD and mechanical circulatory support. \n   When it would be appropriate to switch off devices such as ICD or  \n   CRT. \n   Resuscitation status.\n   Preferred location of death (i.e. at home or hospital).\n 2. Symptom management \n  Goals of care at this stage should shift from extending life to controlling \n  symptoms and maximising quality of life. Common symptoms include:\n   Dyspnoea\n   Fatigue\n   Pain\n   Urinary retention \n  Constipation\n  Cachexia\n  Depression\n Medications that may be useful include analgesics, antiemetics, anxiolytics,  \n opioids, laxatives, and diuretics, etc. \n3. Psychosocial support\n The impact of HF on quality of life for the patient and family is complex and  \n extends beyond physical symptoms.502\n Emotional, spiritual and social support should be provided to alleviate patient  \n anxiety about dying, and to guide patient towards a peaceful journey at the end  \n of life.\n9.1 LEVEL OF CARE AND SHARED MANAGEMENT \nThe care of patients with HF should ideally take place in a multidisciplinary system, \nallowing for shared care between the hospital (secondary or tertiary settings) and \ncommunity (primary setting). A multidisciplinary approach encompasses patient \neducation, cardiac rehabilitation, psychosocial support and palliative care, and has been proven to reduce HF hospitalisations and mortality in discharged patients.\n503-505\nThe multidisciplinary team usually consists of cardiologists and or general physicians, HF nurses, pharmacists, dieticians, physiotherapists, primary care \nproviders, social workers as well as geriatricians, psychologists, occupational \ntherapists and when necessary, palliative care specialists. Care can be done in two different settings: \n In the patient’s own home - home-based interventions are associated with  \n significantly lower healthcare costs, reduced hospital readmissions and an  \n improvement in the patient’s quality of life.506 This may however, not be feasible  \n in our local setting.\n Specialist outpatient clinic - the Heart Failure Clinic (HFC). \nHFCs can either be:\n Nurse-directed - these are run by nurses with special training in HF.\n Physician-directed - run by general physicians and/or cardiologists. \nHFCs can be established in the tertiary hospitals or in the primary care setting. The minimum human resource requirements are a:\n Cardiologist or general physician with an interest in cardiology and HF, \n Dedicated nurse and \n Medical technologist for blood taking, doing echocardiography and 6 minutes \n walk tests.In bigger clinic settings, the involvement of physiotherapists to encourage physical \nactivity, pharmacists and counsellors for end of life care would be advisable.\nThese clinics will be the intermediary between in-patient hospital care and community \nprimary care. Patients who can be seen in these clinics include those:507\n Recently discharged after an admission for decompensated HF (a waiting \n time of 7-12 days post discharge has to be the maximum wait-time).\n Who are in the early decompensation phase and need treatment modification.\n Who are stable but need uptitration of HF medications.\n With ICD or CRTs. \n With comorbidities, such as renal dysfunction, diabetes and COPD.\n With advanced HF who may benefit from:\n  Heart transplant\n  Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD)\n  Palliative care.\nThe objectives of these HF clinics may vary based on local settings. These include:\n507,508\n Optimisation of medical therapy particularly the uptitration of β-blockers, ACE-I  \n and MRA. \n Education of the patient and caregiver on the nature of the disease and its  \n progression. \n Promotion of self-care such as :\n  Compliance to medical therapy and fluid restriction.\n  Regular weighing and adjusting diuretic doses according to symptoms and  \n  body weight.\nPatient with optimised HF medications/treatment plans can be discharged to the \ncommunity with appropriate care plans to primary care. Close partnership between these HF clinics and primary care helps to reduce unnecessary admissions to hospital. \nIn 2018, the Heart Failure Medication Therapy Adherence Clinic (MTAC) was \nintroduced. These clinics are conducted by pharmacists in collaboration with doctors and other healthcare providers to improve HF management. The objectives of the Heart Failure MTAC are:\n509\n Enhance patient’s adherence to HF pharmacotherapy and non-pharmacological  \n interventions.\n To reduce unscheduled emergency department visits or hospitalisations of HF  \n patient due to acute decompensation.\n To provide consultative service to doctors on evidence-based HF pharmacotherapy  \n and related issues.\n To collaborate with doctors and other health care professionals in HF management  \n program.9.2 MONITORING AND FOLLOW-UP \nPatients with HF require regular follow-up and monitoring. Serial evaluations serve \nto assess a patient’s status, response to therapy, development of complications and disease progression. Key components of assessment include:\n Functional capacity - NYHA functional class or 6-minute walk test \n Fluid status and body weight \n Blood pressure, heart rate and rhythm \n Examination of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems\n Cognitive status and nutritional status \n Review of pharmacotherapy - uptitration, compliance and side effects\n Serum urea, electrolytes, creatinine and eGFR as necessary\n Diet and sodium intake\n Consumption of alcohol or illicit drugs\n Smoking history.\nThe frequency of follow-up will depend on the patient’s clinical stability and need for pharmacotherapy optimisation. A patient with a recent episode of decompensation or clinical instability, for instance, should ideally be seen again soon, usually within 2 weeks. Ultimately, the intensity and type of follow-up would be determined by the local organisation of care and resources.\nRoutine serial echocardiogram is not recommended. However, if there has been a \nrecent change in clinical status or if the patient has received treatment that might significantly change certain echocardiographic parameters, a follow-up echocardiogram is reasonable to assess the LVEF and structural remodeling.\nSerial brain natriuretic peptide measurements to guide and tailor HF therapy cannot \nbe broadly recommended at the present time due to a lack of consistent evidence.\n29-32 \n9.3 CARDIOLOGY REFERRAL \nHF patients with stable symptoms may be managed at the primary care level. \nReferral to the cardiologist should be considered in the following situations: \n De novo HF for a comprehensive workup to confirm the diagnosis and determine  \n the aetiology, and to devise a management plan.\n Episodes of acute decompensation.\n Worsening HF symptoms despite appropriate therapy. \n HF complicated with symptomatic hypotension or excessive bradycardia, limiting \n uptitration of pharmacotherapy. Symptomatic stable CAD and/or acute coronary syndrome for consideration of  \n revascularisation (PCI or CABG). \n Resuscitated cardiac arrest.\n Documented or suspected significant arrhythmias e.g. AF, VT.\n Significant valvular disease not previously assessed or worsening valvular  \n dysfunction.\n Pre-conception assessment and counselling of women with significant structural  \n heart disease and a past history of HF or LV dysfunction. \n Complex congenital cardiac lesions and/or Eisenmenger’s syndrome.\nDespite taking conventional HF therapy, patients may seek alternative therapy and healing approaches that are not considered as allopathic medicine. The National Centre for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) defines complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) as a group of diverse medical and healthcare interventions, practices, products or disciplines that are not generally considered part of conventional medicine.\n10.1 Enhanced External Counter Pulsation (EECP)\nThere is inadequate evidence of clinical effectiveness of EECP in HF.\n510-513 There is \nconcern that it could precipitate or exacerbate HF. \n10.2 Stem cell therapy\nA global position paper on cardiovascular regenerative medicine stated that \ncell-based therapy in HF patients is neither positive nor consistent.514 \n10.3 Omega 3 fatty acids\nIn patients with HFrEF, it may be considered as an adjunctive therapy based on a \nsingle randomised controlled trial (RCT) which showed a small benefit in CV death and/or hospitalisations.\n515,516 10.4 Coenzyme Q10\nThere is no convincing evidence to support or refute the use of coenzyme Q10 for \npatients with HF.517\n10.5 Tai Chi\nTai Chi may improve 6 min walk test distance, quality of life and LVEF in patients with \nHF.518,519 Its effect on hard CV outcomes such as rehospitalisation, MI and mortality \nis not known. \n10.6 YogaA meta-analysis in 2014 that includes two RCTs concluded that yoga improved peak \nVO2 (exercise capacity) and quality of life in chronic HF patients.\n520 There is an \nongoing RCT to look at the effect of yoga in HFpEF patients.521\nThe focus of future development for HF in Malaysia should be towards service \nenhancement working to meet the World Heart Federation mandate of a 25% reduction in premature non-communicable disease mortality by 2025. \nFinding the balance between costs and quality remains a global challenge, and the \nunderstanding of the disease in our healthcare context is imperative to making sure we move forward regarding service delivery, human resource allocation, medical expense costs and patient outcomes. To achieve this, the following need to be undertaken: \n Epidemiological studies to understand the disease profile in the country.\n Establishment and expansion of HFCs leading to more patient-centred HF care.\n Expanding service delivery, human resource allocation, medical expense cost  \n and patient outcomes.\n Education of healthcare personnel.\nEfforts should be directed to the knowledge and understanding of the epidemiology of HF in our country, its phenotype, presentation, current adherence to guideline-directed therapy and outcomes. Regular cluster sampling cohorts or a nationwide registry should be considered. Understanding the limitations of service delivery albeit geography or human resources and making plans for better service delivery systems \nare important.\nDevelopment of HFCs, can lead to a more patient-centric HF care. (See Section 9, \nPages 110-113)\nModules for HF care need to be initiated in order to train and educate general \ninternal medicine physicians. A core-curriculum for education needs to be formed to ensure adequate training has been disseminated to HFC personnel.   \nIncentives regarding HF guidelines compliance should be implemented and HF \ninnovative practice should be encouraged with awards for best clinical practice and innovation be made available. \nThis streamline approach to HF care with engagement of connected groups hopefully \nwill help in better overall patient care and experience.\nPerformance measures should be used with the goal of improving quality of care for HF.\n518,519\nProcess performance measures focus on the aspects of care that are delivered to a patient, \nwhile outcome measures focus on the end-points such as mortality or hospitalisation.\nProcess performance indicators for in-patients with HF includes:522-524\n % of patients who had documentation of NYHA Functional Class.\n % of patients who had LVEF measurement.\n % of patients with current or prior LVEF < 40% and without contraindications  \n discharged with ACE-I/ARB. \n % of patients with current or prior LVEF < 40% and without contraindications  \n discharged on β-blockers.\n % of patients with current or prior LVEF < 40% and without contraindications  \n discharged on MRA.\n % of patients with chronic or paroxysmal AF/atrial flutter without contraindications  \n on anticoagulant therapy at discharge.\n % of patients given a post discharge appointment.\nThe accepted performance measure should be more than 60%.Outcome measures indicators include:\n In-hospital mortality\n 30-day readmission for HF\nRefer to Appendix VI, Page 121 for calculation of these measures.\n12.

Cardiomyopathy characterised by a decrease in Ejection Fraction (EF)  \n globally or due to regional changes in interventricular septum contraction. \n2. Symptoms of HF.3. Signs associated with HF including but not limited to S3 gallop, tachycardia,  \n or both.4. Decline in initial EF of at least 5% to < 55% with signs and symptoms of  \n HF or asymptomatic decrease in EF of at least 10% to < 55%.Chemotherapy drugs that have been associated with HF include (Appendix V, Page120):\n Doxorubicin \n  5% at a cumulative dose of 400mg/m2 (the higher the cumulative dose, \n  the greater the risk of HF.445  \n  Even at lower doses of 180 to 240mg/m2, subclinical events can  \n  occur in up to 30% of patients about 13 years post treatment.448\n  These suggest that there is no ‘safe’ dose for doxorubicin. \n Cyclophosphamide especially in high doses and ifosfomide.449,450  \n Newer agents such as monoclonal antibodies (trastuzumab and pertuzumab), \n small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (imatinib, sunitinib, sorafenib)  \n and the proteasome inhibitor (bortezomib).  Trastuzumab especially when administered together with anthracyclines \n  and cyclophosphamide, has been associated with an increased incidence \n  of HF of 27% compared to 1.7% to 4.1% when anthracycline was not part  \n  of the therapeutic regimen.\n451-453 Symptoms are usually mild to moderate \n  and improve following medical management and termination of drug  \n  administration. Improvement is usually seen in about 4-6 weeks after    withdrawal of the agent.\n454-456 After symptomatic improvement, \n  reinstitution  of treatment is usually possible.454-456\n  Vascular endothelial growth factor signaling pathway (VSP) inhibitors  \n  (bevacizumab) can cause hypertension. Bevacizumab also blocks  \n  receptors that are involved in the compensatory response to stress in  \n  the cardiomyocytes and when the heart is unable to compensate for  \n  the hypertension, it could lead to HF.457,458 Maintaining good blood pressure \n  control can prevent HF associated with this agent. Heart failure due to  \n  VSP inhibitors is usually reversible with cessation of the agent.459\nOne must consider both the efficacy and the toxicity in choosing chemotherapeutic agents. Many of the newer targeted agents cause a reversible form of HF and symptoms usually resolve after the initiation of anti-failure medications.\n454-456,459,460 \nRisk factors for anthracycline toxicity include: 461-465\n The total cumulative dose\n Intravenous bolus administration versus infusion\n Higher single doses\n History of prior irradiation\n Use of concomitant agents known to have cardiotoxicity\n Female gender\n Underlying CV disease\n Age (young and elderly)\n An increase in cardiac biomarkers such as troponins during and   after administration is an indication of toxicity.8.5.5.1 Management\n Patients undergoing chemotherapy should have a careful clinical evaluation \n and assessment and treatment of CV risk factors.464,465\n Blood pressure control is important in all patients especially in those  \n being considered for VSP inhibitors.\n All patients with potential cardiotoxic chemotherapy should have an  \n echocardiogram prior to treatment. An important parameter is the LVEF  \n determined using the biplane method of discs (Simpson’s method) or  \n three-dimensional echocardiography where available. Newer techniques   to detect and quantitate regional and global myocardial dysfunction  \n (strain assessment with global longitudinal strain) can be used to detect  \n pre-clinical and subtle changes in function.\n466-469 \n Biomarkers such as troponin and natriuretic peptides can help identify  \n patients at higher risk.462,463,470,471 \nClose collaboration between the oncologist and the cardiologist is important. \nFor the oncologists, the strategy (prior to commencement) includes:465\n Identifying high risk patients (pre-existing heart disease, presence of  \n CV risk factors, age - young and old, female gender, use of high dose  \n anthracycline regimens).\n High risk patients should:\n  Have a pre-treatment cardiac function evaluation. If the LVEF is < 50%,  \n  refer to the cardiologist.  Be considered for non-cardiotoxic alternatives. \n  Have their therapy protocols adjusted where necessary (e.g. reduction \n  in doses, continuous infusions rather than bolus injections, liposomal    doxorubicin, dexrazoxane etc). \nFor the cardiologists/general physicians, the strategy includes:\n Treating CV risk factors. \n Assessing, repeating (if necessary) imaging studies. (e.g. using high  \n quality LVEF measurement, strain evaluation etc).\n Assessing cardiac biomarkers (troponin and/or NP).\n Considering cardio-protection prior to/or during treatment using β-blockers,  \n MRA and/or ACE-I/ARB if:69,465,472-474\n  EF < 50%, \n  EF drops by > 10%\n  Abnormal global longitudinal strain (GLS) (> 15% drop).  Monitoring LVEF during therapy is important with repeat echocardiography  \n at 3-monthly intervals and/or according to symptoms. If cardioprotective  \n medications are given, monitoring may be necessary at closer intervals of  \n time depending on the clinical condition of the patient e.g. 1-monthly interval. \n Withholding cardiotoxic therapy only as a last resort. (for anthracycline  \n LVEF < 45%, for anti-HER2 therapy LVEF < 40%).\n Monitoring even after completion of therapy:\n  Obtain post therapy LVEF.\n  Repeat echocardiography in 6 months or 1 year. Most cases of  \n  treatment-associated cardiac dysfunction develop within the first year  \n  after completion of therapy.475,476 \n  If EF remains abnormal, follow guidelines for management of HF.465 \n \n8.5.6 HEART FAILURE AND KIDNEY DYSFUNCTION\n8.5.6.1 Epidemiology, definitions and classifications Cardiac and pre-existing kidney disease at admission frequently co-exist, \nvarying from 45.4% in patients with chronic HF to > 60% in those with AHF.\n477,478 \nIn addition, during treatment of AHF, a significant proportion of patients will develop varying degrees of worsening renal function (WRF).\nThe definition of WRF is:\n479\n An increase in serum creatinine by ≥ 26.5μmol/ L (0.3mg/dl) and/or\n A ≥ 25% increase in serum creatinine or a ≥ 20% drop in eGFR.\nThe rise in serum creatinine usually occurs in the first three to five days of \nhospitalisation. The incidence of WRF is estimated to be between 19 and 45%.165 This large \nobserved range is due to variations in the definitions of WRF, the observed time-at-risk and the study population.\n165 \nRisk factors for WRF during admission for HF include:480\n A prior history of HF or diabetes, \n An admission serum creatinine of > 133μmol/L,  or \n Systolic blood pressure > 160mmHg. \nWRF may fulfill criteria for type 1 or type 2 cardiorenal syndrome (CRS). The term “cardiorenal syndrome” refers to disorders of the heart and kidneys whereby acute or chronic dysfunction in one organ may induce acute or chronic dysfunction of the other.\n165 \nThis syndrome has been classified by the Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative working group into 5 subtypes as shown in Table 17, Page 105.\n165 Many \npatients however, may belong to more than one subtype and may move between subtypes during the course of their disease.\n165\n8.5.6.2. Pathogenesis of CRS \nMultiple mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of CRS. These include:\n Increased renal venous pressure  - venous congestion is probably the  \n most important factor.481 \n RV dysfunction.\n Reduced renal perfusion with reduced cardiac output. \n Neurohumoral adaptations (e.g. activation of the sympathetic nervous  \n system and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, increases in  \n vasopressin and endothelin-1).8.5.6.3  Clinical significance /Impact of kidney dysfunction in HF  The combination of cardiac and kidney disease increases the complexity and \ncosts of care, and may interact to worsen prognosis. \nA. Pharmacologic considerations \n Safety:\n  Dosing of renally-excreted cardiac drugs need adjustment in the  \n  presence of renal impairment (e.g. digoxin, insulin, low molecular  \n  weight heparin).\n  Patients with HF are at increased risk of contrast-induced acute kidney \n  injury. \n Efficacy:\n  Impaired renal function will affect drug choices and dosing. If eGFR <  \n  30mls/min/1.73m2, most thiazide diuretics are no longer effective and  \n  loop diuretics are preferred. Higher doses of loop diuretics may be   \n  required with increasing renal impairment.             B. Prognostic implications\n Preexisting CKD is a bad prognostic indicator in patients with HF - the  \n more severe the CKD, the worse the mortality.482,483\n In patients with HF, WRF may not always indicate a poor outcome.484 The  \n prognostic value of WRF is mainly determined by:   The presence of persistent congestion  \n  Baseline renal function and magnitude of renal changes \n  Duration - persistent WRF is usually associated with hemodynamic  \n  derangements and poor prognosis as compared with transient WRF  \n  as a result of agressive decongestive therapy.485-487\nTable 17: Classification of Cardiorenal Syndrome (CRS)8.5.6.4. Management \n A multi-disciplinary approach is recommended. Early referral to a  \n nephrologist is advisable.   \n Exclude potentially reversible causes for increasing renal dysfunction  \n such as hyper - or hypovolaemia, concomitant medications such as  \n aminoglycosides and NSAIDs, ACE-I or ARB and renal artery stenosis. \n Closely monitor electrolytes and kidney function, especially during acute  \n illnesses, dehydration and when increasing doses of cardiac drugs  \n including diuretics. The baseline renal function will determine how frequently \n this should be done. \n The recommended range for serum potassium is 4-5.5mmol/L.488 \n Wherever possible, avoid nephrotoxins, e.g. contrast media for angiography\n Intravenous diuretics \n  Loop diuretics are the first choice.\n  Continuous infusion may not have greater benefits compared with  \n  bolus dosing.115-118,489\n  Start initially with 2-2.5 times the usual oral dose. \n  Combination therapy (loop diuretic and thiazide/thiazide-like diuretic/\n  mineralocorticoid) may be required to enhance diuresis.205-207 However,  \n  care is required to avoid electrolyte disturbances, hypovolaemia and  \n  worsening renal dysfunction. \n Careful use of Renin Angiotensin System (RAS) blockers  \n  HF patients with stable, chronic mild-moderate renal insufficiency  \n  (eGFR > 30mls/min/1.73m2) should receive standard therapy with an  \n  ACE-I/ ARB and an MRA.490\n  A serum creatinine rise or GFR decrease by up to 30% from baseline  \n  may be acceptable before it becomes necessary to consider stopping  \n  or decreasing doses.221 \n  In patients with advanced renal failure, the decision to start or stop  \n  RAS blockers should be individualised.490\n  Consider withholding RAS blockers during aggressive diuresis in  \n  patients at high risk for WRF.  RAS blockers (and β-blockers) can be used in patients with HF who  \n  are on chronic dialysis therapy.\n Ultrafiltration \n  This involves the removal of plasma water across a semi-permeable  \n  membrane in response to a transmembrane pressure gradient.   It may be considered for congestive symptoms refractory to diuresis,  \n  but should be used in consultation with a nephrologist.\n491\n  Evidence for its efficacy in fluid removal is mixed at present.491  Haemodialysis \n  Criteria for possible need to initiate renal replacement therapy include:\n   Oliguria unresponsive to fluid resuscitation.\n   Severe hyperkalaemia (serum potassium > 6.5mmol/L).\n   Severe acidaemia (pH < 7.2). \n   Serum urea > 25mmol/L. \n    Serum creatinine > 300μmol/L. \n8.6  ADVANCED HEART FAILURE/REFRACTORY HEART FAILURE\nThese are patients with severe symptoms of HF despite maximal medical \ntherapy. Hospital admission is necessary for stabilisation. Meticulous control of fluid balance is important. Aggravating causes of HF as listed in Table 5, Page 39 should be identified and treated.\nThese patients may need specialised treatment in CCU or ICU. The following \nmay be required:\n Intravenous infusion of frusemide. These patients may require combination  \n loop diuretics and thiazides.\n Intravenous infusion of inotropes - low dose dobutamine (5mcg/kg/min) or  \n milrinone. These improve symptoms but no survival benefit has been  \n demonstrated.126,492\n Ultrafiltration in patients who are fluid overloaded.493 In most patients,  \n however, the relief is temporary.\nThe prognosis of these patients is poor. They should be referred to assess \nwhether they may be potential candidates for mechanical circulatory support (e.g. LVAD) and consideration for heart transplant.\n8.6.1 HEART TRANSPLANTHeart transplantation is a well-established treatment of refractory end stage \nHF. This definitive therapy for HF however is limited by the lack of donor organs.\n494,495All patients with severe symptomatic HF despite optimal medical therapy and no other alternative therapy option should be considered for heart transplant. They need to be referred to a HF specialist cardiac hospital for further evaluation.\nAssessment for heart transplant is done by a multispeciality, multidisciplinary \nteam and appropriate work up will be performed for eligibility.\nEligibility criteria to be considered for heart transplant include:\n Poor LVEF (< 25%).\n Recurrent HF hospitalisations.\n Major limitation of the patient’s daily activities.\n Poor effort tolerance i.e. peak VO2 (maximal oxygen consumption or  \n peak oxygen uptake) less than 10ml/kg/min (or < 50% predicted). VO2  \n max is the maximum rate of oxygen consumption measured during  \n incremental exercise ie exercise of increasing intensity and is widely  \n used as an indicator of cardiorespiratory fitness.\n Intravenous inotropic dependence for symptomatic relief or to maintain  \n end organ function.\n Motivated, psychologically stable and compliant to therapy.\nContraindications to heart transplant\n Active infection.\n Severe peripheral arterial or cerebrovascular disease.\n Malignancy within 5 years.\n Diabetes mellitus with widespread microvascular complications.\n Systemic disease with multi-organ dysfunction.\n Irreversible chronic kidney, liver or lung disease.\n Pharmacologically irreversible pulmonary hypertension.\n Other medical or psychosocial issues that would impact survival.\n8.6.2 MECHANICAL CIRCULATORY SUPPORT The use of mechanical circulatory support (e.g. LVAD), should be considered \nfor patients with potentially reversible or treatable conditions or as a bridge to heart transplant in suitable candidates.\nLVAD may also be used as destination therapy in candidates who are not \nsuitable for transplant. Patients have improvement in their symptoms when compared to optimal medical therapy.\n496,497 However, the rate of rehospitalisations \ndue to complications of bleeding, thrombosis and infections are high.496-498 \nMany patients also go into major depression. Thus, extensive discussion with the patient and family is necessary prior to LVAD implantation.8.7 PALLIATIVE AND END OF LIFE CARE\nDespite recent advances in therapy, for some patients, HF remains a \nprogressive disease and carries a poor prognosis. Patients with refractory symptoms despite guideline-directed medical therapy, should be considered for palliative and end of life care if they have the following characteristics:\n499\n Progressive functional decline (mental and physical) and dependence in  \n most activities of daily living.\n Severe HF symptoms with poor quality of life despite optimal pharmacological \n and non-pharmacological therapies.\n Frequent hospital admissions or serious episodes of decompensation  \n despite optimal therapies.\n Heart transplantation and mechanical circulatory support ruled out.\n Cardiac cachexia.\n Clinically judged to be near end of life.\nThe aim of palliative care in HF is to prevent and relieve suffering and to promote the best quality of life for patients and their families.\n500\nDespite the complexities of end-of-life issues in HF patients, there is minimal evidence-based guidance on the care of this population.\n501 The key components \nof end-of-life care are:\n 1. Advanced care plan with directives and informed decisions on:\n   Use or withdrawal of treatment including advanced therapies such  \n   as V inotropes, ICD and mechanical circulatory support. \n   When it would be appropriate to switch off devices such as ICD or  \n   CRT. \n   Resuscitation status.\n   Preferred location of death (i.e. at home or hospital).\n 2. Symptom management \n  Goals of care at this stage should shift from extending life to controlling \n  symptoms and maximising quality of life. Common symptoms include:\n   Dyspnoea\n   Fatigue\n   Pain\n   Urinary retention \n  Constipation\n  Cachexia\n  Depression\n Medications that may be useful include analgesics, antiemetics, anxiolytics,  \n opioids, laxatives, and diuretics, etc. \n3. Psychosocial support\n The impact of HF on quality of life for the patient and family is complex and  \n extends beyond physical symptoms.502\n Emotional, spiritual and social support should be provided to alleviate patient  \n anxiety about dying, and to guide patient towards a peaceful journey at the end  \n of life.\n9.1 LEVEL OF CARE AND SHARED MANAGEMENT \nThe care of patients with HF should ideally take place in a multidisciplinary system, \nallowing for shared care between the hospital (secondary or tertiary settings) and \ncommunity (primary setting). A multidisciplinary approach encompasses patient \neducation, cardiac rehabilitation, psychosocial support and palliative care, and has been proven to reduce HF hospitalisations and mortality in discharged patients.\n503-505\nThe multidisciplinary team usually consists of cardiologists and or general physicians, HF nurses, pharmacists, dieticians, physiotherapists, primary care \nproviders, social workers as well as geriatricians, psychologists, occupational \ntherapists and when necessary, palliative care specialists. Care can be done in two different settings: \n In the patient’s own home - home-based interventions are associated with  \n significantly lower healthcare costs, reduced hospital readmissions and an  \n improvement in the patient’s quality of life.506 This may however, not be feasible  \n in our local setting.\n Specialist outpatient clinic - the Heart Failure Clinic (HFC). \nHFCs can either be:\n Nurse-directed - these are run by nurses with special training in HF.\n Physician-directed - run by general physicians and/or cardiologists. \nHFCs can be established in the tertiary hospitals or in the primary care setting. The minimum human resource requirements are a:\n Cardiologist or general physician with an interest in cardiology and HF, \n Dedicated nurse and \n Medical technologist for blood taking, doing echocardiography and 6 minutes \n walk tests.In bigger clinic settings, the involvement of physiotherapists to encourage physical \nactivity, pharmacists and counsellors for end of life care would be advisable.\nThese clinics will be the intermediary between in-patient hospital care and community \nprimary care. Patients who can be seen in these clinics include those:507\n Recently discharged after an admission for decompensated HF (a waiting \n time of 7-12 days post discharge has to be the maximum wait-time).\n Who are in the early decompensation phase and need treatment modification.\n Who are stable but need uptitration of HF medications.\n With ICD or CRTs. \n With comorbidities, such as renal dysfunction, diabetes and COPD.\n With advanced HF who may benefit from:\n  Heart transplant\n  Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD)\n  Palliative care.\nThe objectives of these HF clinics may vary based on local settings. These include:\n507,508\n Optimisation of medical therapy particularly the uptitration of β-blockers, ACE-I  \n and MRA. \n Education of the patient and caregiver on the nature of the disease and its  \n progression. \n Promotion of self-care such as :\n  Compliance to medical therapy and fluid restriction.\n  Regular weighing and adjusting diuretic doses according to symptoms and  \n  body weight.\nPatient with optimised HF medications/treatment plans can be discharged to the \ncommunity with appropriate care plans to primary care. Close partnership between these HF clinics and primary care helps to reduce unnecessary admissions to hospital. \nIn 2018, the Heart Failure Medication Therapy Adherence Clinic (MTAC) was \nintroduced. These clinics are conducted by pharmacists in collaboration with doctors and other healthcare providers to improve HF management. The objectives of the Heart Failure MTAC are:\n509\n Enhance patient’s adherence to HF pharmacotherapy and non-pharmacological  \n interventions.\n To reduce unscheduled emergency department visits or hospitalisations of HF  \n patient due to acute decompensation.\n To provide consultative service to doctors on evidence-based HF pharmacotherapy  \n and related issues.\n To collaborate with doctors and other health care professionals in HF management  \n program.9.2 MONITORING AND FOLLOW-UP \nPatients with HF require regular follow-up and monitoring. Serial evaluations serve \nto assess a patient’s status, response to therapy, development of complications and disease progression. Key components of assessment include:\n Functional capacity - NYHA functional class or 6-minute walk test \n Fluid status and body weight \n Blood pressure, heart rate and rhythm \n Examination of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems\n Cognitive status and nutritional status \n Review of pharmacotherapy - uptitration, compliance and side effects\n Serum urea, electrolytes, creatinine and eGFR as necessary\n Diet and sodium intake\n Consumption of alcohol or illicit drugs\n Smoking history.\nThe frequency of follow-up will depend on the patient’s clinical stability and need for pharmacotherapy optimisation. A patient with a recent episode of decompensation or clinical instability, for instance, should ideally be seen again soon, usually within 2 weeks. Ultimately, the intensity and type of follow-up would be determined by the local organisation of care and resources.\nRoutine serial echocardiogram is not recommended. However, if there has been a \nrecent change in clinical status or if the patient has received treatment that might significantly change certain echocardiographic parameters, a follow-up echocardiogram is reasonable to assess the LVEF and structural remodeling.\nSerial brain natriuretic peptide measurements to guide and tailor HF therapy cannot \nbe broadly recommended at the present time due to a lack of consistent evidence.\n29-32 \n9.3 CARDIOLOGY REFERRAL \nHF patients with stable symptoms may be managed at the primary care level. \nReferral to the cardiologist should be considered in the following situations: \n De novo HF for a comprehensive workup to confirm the diagnosis and determine  \n the aetiology, and to devise a management plan.\n Episodes of acute decompensation.\n Worsening HF symptoms despite appropriate therapy. \n HF complicated with symptomatic hypotension or excessive bradycardia, limiting \n uptitration of pharmacotherapy. Symptomatic stable CAD and/or acute coronary syndrome for consideration of  \n revascularisation (PCI or CABG). \n Resuscitated cardiac arrest.\n Documented or suspected significant arrhythmias e.g. AF, VT.\n Significant valvular disease not previously assessed or worsening valvular  \n dysfunction.\n Pre-conception assessment and counselling of women with significant structural  \n heart disease and a past history of HF or LV dysfunction. \n Complex congenital cardiac lesions and/or Eisenmenger’s syndrome.\nDespite taking conventional HF therapy, patients may seek alternative therapy and healing approaches that are not considered as allopathic medicine. The National Centre for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) defines complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) as a group of diverse medical and healthcare interventions, practices, products or disciplines that are not generally considered part of conventional medicine.\n10.1 Enhanced External Counter Pulsation (EECP)\nThere is inadequate evidence of clinical effectiveness of EECP in HF.\n510-513 There is \nconcern that it could precipitate or exacerbate HF. \n10.2 Stem cell therapy\nA global position paper on cardiovascular regenerative medicine stated that \ncell-based therapy in HF patients is neither positive nor consistent.514 \n10.3 Omega 3 fatty acids\nIn patients with HFrEF, it may be considered as an adjunctive therapy based on a \nsingle randomised controlled trial (RCT) which showed a small benefit in CV death and/or hospitalisations.\n515,516 10.4 Coenzyme Q10\nThere is no convincing evidence to support or refute the use of coenzyme Q10 for \npatients with HF.517\n10.5 Tai Chi\nTai Chi may improve 6 min walk test distance, quality of life and LVEF in patients with \nHF.518,519 Its effect on hard CV outcomes such as rehospitalisation, MI and mortality \nis not known. \n10.6 YogaA meta-analysis in 2014 that includes two RCTs concluded that yoga improved peak \nVO2 (exercise capacity) and quality of life in chronic HF patients.\n520 There is an \nongoing RCT to look at the effect of yoga in HFpEF patients.521\nThe focus of future development for HF in Malaysia should be towards service \nenhancement working to meet the World Heart Federation mandate of a 25% reduction in premature non-communicable disease mortality by 2025. \nFinding the balance between costs and quality remains a global challenge, and the \nunderstanding of the disease in our healthcare context is imperative to making sure we move forward regarding service delivery, human resource allocation, medical expense costs and patient outcomes. To achieve this, the following need to be undertaken: \n Epidemiological studies to understand the disease profile in the country.\n Establishment and expansion of HFCs leading to more patient-centred HF care.\n Expanding service delivery, human resource allocation, medical expense cost  \n and patient outcomes.\n Education of healthcare personnel.\nEfforts should be directed to the knowledge and understanding of the epidemiology of HF in our country, its phenotype, presentation, current adherence to guideline-directed therapy and outcomes. Regular cluster sampling cohorts or a nationwide registry should be considered. Understanding the limitations of service delivery albeit geography or human resources and making plans for better service delivery systems \nare important.\nDevelopment of HFCs, can lead to a more patient-centric HF care. (See Section 9, Pages 110-113)\nModules for HF care need to be initiated in order to train and educate general \ninternal medicine physicians. A core-curriculum for education needs to be formed to ensure adequate training has been disseminated to HFC personnel.   \nIncentives regarding HF guidelines compliance should be implemented and HF \ninnovative practice should be encouraged with awards for best clinical practice and innovation be made available. \nThis streamline approach to HF care with engagement of connected groups hopefully \nwill help in better overall patient care and experience.\nPerformance measures should be used with the goal of improving quality of care for HF.\n518,519\nProcess performance measures focus on the aspects of care that are delivered to a patient, \nwhile outcome measures focus on the end-points such as mortality or hospitalisation.\nProcess performance indicators for in-patients with HF includes:522-524\n % of patients who had documentation of NYHA Functional Class.\n % of patients who had LVEF measurement.\n % of patients with current or prior LVEF < 40% and without contraindications  \n discharged with ACE-I/ARB. \n % of patients with current or prior LVEF < 40% and without contraindications  \n discharged on β-blockers.\n % of patients with current or prior LVEF < 40% and without contraindications  \n discharged on MRA.\n % of patients with chronic or paroxysmal AF/atrial flutter without contraindications  \n on anticoagulant therapy at discharge.\n % of patients given a post discharge appointment.\nThe accepted performance measure should be more than 60%.Outcome measures indicators include:\n In-hospital mortality\n 30-day readmission for HF\nRefer to Appendix VI, Page 121 for calculation of these measures.Appendix I: Causes of Elevated Natriuretic Peptide Levels*\n*Adapted from \n Yancy WC, Jessup M, Bozkut B, et al. 2017 ACC/AHA/HFSA Focused Update of the 2013 ACCF/AHA  Guideline for the Management of Heart Failure.

Cardiomyopathy characterised by a decrease in Ejection Fraction (EF)  \n globally or due to regional changes in interventricular septum contraction. \n2. Symptoms of HF.3. Signs associated with HF including but not limited to S3 gallop, tachycardia,  \n or both.4. Decline in initial EF of at least 5% to < 55% with signs and symptoms of  \n HF or asymptomatic decrease in EF of at least 10% to < 55%.Chemotherapy drugs that have been associated with HF include (Appendix V, Page120):\n Doxorubicin \n  5% at a cumulative dose of 400mg/m2 (the higher the cumulative dose, \n  the greater the risk of HF.445  \n  Even at lower doses of 180 to 240mg/m2, subclinical events can  \n  occur in up to 30% of patients about 13 years post treatment.448\n  These suggest that there is no ‘safe’ dose for doxorubicin. \n Cyclophosphamide especially in high doses and ifosfomide.449,450  \n Newer agents such as monoclonal antibodies (trastuzumab and pertuzumab), \n small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (imatinib, sunitinib, sorafenib)  \n and the proteasome inhibitor (bortezomib).  Trastuzumab especially when administered together with anthracyclines \n  and cyclophosphamide, has been associated with an increased incidence \n  of HF of 27% compared to 1.7% to 4.1% when anthracycline was not part  \n  of the therapeutic regimen.\n451-453 Symptoms are usually mild to moderate \n  and improve following medical management and termination of drug  \n  administration. Improvement is usually seen in about 4-6 weeks after    withdrawal of the agent.\n454-456 After symptomatic improvement, \n  reinstitution  of treatment is usually possible.454-456\n  Vascular endothelial growth factor signaling pathway (VSP) inhibitors  \n  (bevacizumab) can cause hypertension. Bevacizumab also blocks  \n  receptors that are involved in the compensatory response to stress in  \n  the cardiomyocytes and when the heart is unable to compensate for  \n  the hypertension, it could lead to HF.457,458 Maintaining good blood pressure \n  control can prevent HF associated with this agent. Heart failure due to  \n  VSP inhibitors is usually reversible with cessation of the agent.459\nOne must consider both the efficacy and the toxicity in choosing chemotherapeutic agents. Many of the newer targeted agents cause a reversible form of HF and symptoms usually resolve after the initiation of anti-failure medications.\n454-456,459,460 \nRisk factors for anthracycline toxicity include: 461-465\n The total cumulative dose\n Intravenous bolus administration versus infusion\n Higher single doses\n History of prior irradiation\n Use of concomitant agents known to have cardiotoxicity\n Female gender\n Underlying CV disease\n Age (young and elderly)\n An increase in cardiac biomarkers such as troponins during and   after administration is an indication of toxicity.8.5.5.1 Management\n Patients undergoing chemotherapy should have a careful clinical evaluation \n and assessment and treatment of CV risk factors.464,465\n Blood pressure control is important in all patients especially in those  \n being considered for VSP inhibitors.\n All patients with potential cardiotoxic chemotherapy should have an  \n echocardiogram prior to treatment. An important parameter is the LVEF  \n determined using the biplane method of discs (Simpson’s method) or  \n three-dimensional echocardiography where available. Newer techniques   to detect and quantitate regional and global myocardial dysfunction  \n (strain assessment with global longitudinal strain) can be used to detect  \n pre-clinical and subtle changes in function.\n466-469 \n Biomarkers such as troponin and natriuretic peptides can help identify  \n patients at higher risk.462,463,470,471 \nClose collaboration between the oncologist and the cardiologist is important. \nFor the oncologists, the strategy (prior to commencement) includes:465\n Identifying high risk patients (pre-existing heart disease, presence of  \n CV risk factors, age - young and old, female gender, use of high dose  \n anthracycline regimens).\n High risk patients should:\n  Have a pre-treatment cardiac function evaluation. If the LVEF is < 50%,  \n  refer to the cardiologist.  Be considered for non-cardiotoxic alternatives. \n  Have their therapy protocols adjusted where necessary (e.g. reduction \n  in doses, continuous infusions rather than bolus injections, liposomal    doxorubicin, dexrazoxane etc). \nFor the cardiologists/general physicians, the strategy includes:\n Treating CV risk factors. \n Assessing, repeating (if necessary) imaging studies. (e.g. using high  \n quality LVEF measurement, strain evaluation etc).\n Assessing cardiac biomarkers (troponin and/or NP).\n Considering cardio-protection prior to/or during treatment using β-blockers,  \n MRA and/or ACE-I/ARB if:69,465,472-474\n  EF < 50%, \n  EF drops by > 10%\n  Abnormal global longitudinal strain (GLS) (> 15% drop).  Monitoring LVEF during therapy is important with repeat echocardiography  \n at 3-monthly intervals and/or according to symptoms. If cardioprotective  \n medications are given, monitoring may be necessary at closer intervals of  \n time depending on the clinical condition of the patient e.g. 1-monthly interval. \n Withholding cardiotoxic therapy only as a last resort. (for anthracycline  \n LVEF < 45%, for anti-HER2 therapy LVEF < 40%).\n Monitoring even after completion of therapy:\n  Obtain post therapy LVEF.\n  Repeat echocardiography in 6 months or 1 year. Most cases of  \n  treatment-associated cardiac dysfunction develop within the first year  \n  after completion of therapy.475,476 \n  If EF remains abnormal, follow guidelines for management of HF.465 \n \n8.5.6 HEART FAILURE AND KIDNEY DYSFUNCTION\n8.5.6.1 Epidemiology, definitions and classifications Cardiac and pre-existing kidney disease at admission frequently co-exist, \nvarying from 45.4% in patients with chronic HF to > 60% in those with AHF.\n477,478 \nIn addition, during treatment of AHF, a significant proportion of patients will develop varying degrees of worsening renal function (WRF).\nThe definition of WRF is:\n479\n An increase in serum creatinine by ≥ 26.5μmol/ L (0.3mg/dl) and/or\n A ≥ 25% increase in serum creatinine or a ≥ 20% drop in eGFR.\nThe rise in serum creatinine usually occurs in the first three to five days of \nhospitalisation. The incidence of WRF is estimated to be between 19 and 45%.165 This large \nobserved range is due to variations in the definitions of WRF, the observed time-at-risk and the study population.\n165 \nRisk factors for WRF during admission for HF include:480\n A prior history of HF or diabetes, \n An admission serum creatinine of > 133μmol/L,  or \n Systolic blood pressure > 160mmHg. \nWRF may fulfill criteria for type 1 or type 2 cardiorenal syndrome (CRS). The term “cardiorenal syndrome” refers to disorders of the heart and kidneys whereby acute or chronic dysfunction in one organ may induce acute or chronic dysfunction of the other.\n165 \nThis syndrome has been classified by the Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative working group into 5 subtypes as shown in Table 17, Page 105.\n165 Many \npatients however, may belong to more than one subtype and may move between subtypes during the course of their disease.\n165\n8.5.6.2. Pathogenesis of CRS \nMultiple mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of CRS. These include:\n Increased renal venous pressure  - venous congestion is probably the  \n most important factor.481 \n RV dysfunction.\n Reduced renal perfusion with reduced cardiac output. \n Neurohumoral adaptations (e.g. activation of the sympathetic nervous  \n system and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, increases in  \n vasopressin and endothelin-1).8.5.6.3  Clinical significance /Impact of kidney dysfunction in HF  The combination of cardiac and kidney disease increases the complexity and \ncosts of care, and may interact to worsen prognosis. \nA. Pharmacologic considerations \n Safety:\n  Dosing of renally-excreted cardiac drugs need adjustment in the  \n  presence of renal impairment (e.g. digoxin, insulin, low molecular  \n  weight heparin).\n  Patients with HF are at increased risk of contrast-induced acute kidney \n  injury. \n Efficacy:\n  Impaired renal function will affect drug choices and dosing. If eGFR <  \n  30mls/min/1.73m2, most thiazide diuretics are no longer effective and  \n  loop diuretics are preferred. Higher doses of loop diuretics may be   \n  required with increasing renal impairment.             B. Prognostic implications\n Preexisting CKD is a bad prognostic indicator in patients with HF - the  \n more severe the CKD, the worse the mortality.482,483\n In patients with HF, WRF may not always indicate a poor outcome.484 The  \n prognostic value of WRF is mainly determined by:   The presence of persistent congestion  \n  Baseline renal function and magnitude of renal changes \n  Duration - persistent WRF is usually associated with hemodynamic  \n  derangements and poor prognosis as compared with transient WRF  \n  as a result of agressive decongestive therapy.485-487\nTable 17: Classification of Cardiorenal Syndrome (CRS)8.5.6.4. Management \n A multi-disciplinary approach is recommended. Early referral to a  \n nephrologist is advisable.   \n Exclude potentially reversible causes for increasing renal dysfunction  \n such as hyper - or hypovolaemia, concomitant medications such as  \n aminoglycosides and NSAIDs, ACE-I or ARB and renal artery stenosis. \n Closely monitor electrolytes and kidney function, especially during acute  \n illnesses, dehydration and when increasing doses of cardiac drugs  \n including diuretics. The baseline renal function will determine how frequently \n this should be done. \n The recommended range for serum potassium is 4-5.5mmol/L.488 \n Wherever possible, avoid nephrotoxins, e.g. contrast media for angiography\n Intravenous diuretics \n  Loop diuretics are the first choice.\n  Continuous infusion may not have greater benefits compared with  \n  bolus dosing.115-118,489\n  Start initially with 2-2.5 times the usual oral dose. \n  Combination therapy (loop diuretic and thiazide/thiazide-like diuretic/\n  mineralocorticoid) may be required to enhance diuresis.205-207 However,  \n  care is required to avoid electrolyte disturbances, hypovolaemia and  \n  worsening renal dysfunction. \n Careful use of Renin Angiotensin System (RAS) blockers  \n  HF patients with stable, chronic mild-moderate renal insufficiency  \n  (eGFR > 30mls/min/1.73m2) should receive standard therapy with an  \n  ACE-I/ ARB and an MRA.490\n  A serum creatinine rise or GFR decrease by up to 30% from baseline  \n  may be acceptable before it becomes necessary to consider stopping  \n  or decreasing doses.221 \n  In patients with advanced renal failure, the decision to start or stop  \n  RAS blockers should be individualised.490\n  Consider withholding RAS blockers during aggressive diuresis in  \n  patients at high risk for WRF.  RAS blockers (and β-blockers) can be used in patients with HF who  \n  are on chronic dialysis therapy.\n Ultrafiltration \n  This involves the removal of plasma water across a semi-permeable  \n  membrane in response to a transmembrane pressure gradient.   It may be considered for congestive symptoms refractory to diuresis,  \n  but should be used in consultation with a nephrologist.\n491\n  Evidence for its efficacy in fluid removal is mixed at present.491  Haemodialysis \n  Criteria for possible need to initiate renal replacement therapy include:\n   Oliguria unresponsive to fluid resuscitation.\n   Severe hyperkalaemia (serum potassium > 6.5mmol/L).\n   Severe acidaemia (pH < 7.2). \n   Serum urea > 25mmol/L. \n    Serum creatinine > 300μmol/L. \n8.6  ADVANCED HEART FAILURE/REFRACTORY HEART FAILURE\nThese are patients with severe symptoms of HF despite maximal medical \ntherapy. Hospital admission is necessary for stabilisation. Meticulous control of fluid balance is important. Aggravating causes of HF as listed in Table 5, Page 39 should be identified and treated.\nThese patients may need specialised treatment in CCU or ICU. The following \nmay be required:\n Intravenous infusion of frusemide. These patients may require combination  \n loop diuretics and thiazides.\n Intravenous infusion of inotropes - low dose dobutamine (5mcg/kg/min) or  \n milrinone. These improve symptoms but no survival benefit has been  \n demonstrated.126,492\n Ultrafiltration in patients who are fluid overloaded.493 In most patients,  \n however, the relief is temporary.\nThe prognosis of these patients is poor. They should be referred to assess \nwhether they may be potential candidates for mechanical circulatory support (e.g. LVAD) and consideration for heart transplant.\n8.6.1 HEART TRANSPLANTHeart transplantation is a well-established treatment of refractory end stage \nHF. This definitive therapy for HF however is limited by the lack of donor organs.\n494,495All patients with severe symptomatic HF despite optimal medical therapy and no other alternative therapy option should be considered for heart transplant. They need to be referred to a HF specialist cardiac hospital for further evaluation.\nAssessment for heart transplant is done by a multispeciality, multidisciplinary \nteam and appropriate work up will be performed for eligibility.\nEligibility criteria to be considered for heart transplant include:\n Poor LVEF (< 25%).\n Recurrent HF hospitalisations.\n Major limitation of the patient’s daily activities.\n Poor effort tolerance i.e. peak VO2 (maximal oxygen consumption or  \n peak oxygen uptake) less than 10ml/kg/min (or < 50% predicted). VO2  \n max is the maximum rate of oxygen consumption measured during  \n incremental exercise ie exercise of increasing intensity and is widely  \n used as an indicator of cardiorespiratory fitness.\n Intravenous inotropic dependence for symptomatic relief or to maintain  \n end organ function.\n Motivated, psychologically stable and compliant to therapy.\nContraindications to heart transplant\n Active infection.\n Severe peripheral arterial or cerebrovascular disease.\n Malignancy within 5 years.\n Diabetes mellitus with widespread microvascular complications.\n Systemic disease with multi-organ dysfunction.\n Irreversible chronic kidney, liver or lung disease.\n Pharmacologically irreversible pulmonary hypertension.\n Other medical or psychosocial issues that would impact survival.\n8.6.2 MECHANICAL CIRCULATORY SUPPORT The use of mechanical circulatory support (e.g. LVAD), should be considered \nfor patients with potentially reversible or treatable conditions or as a bridge to heart transplant in suitable candidates.\nLVAD may also be used as destination therapy in candidates who are not \nsuitable for transplant. Patients have improvement in their symptoms when compared to optimal medical therapy.\n496,497 However, the rate of rehospitalisations \ndue to complications of bleeding, thrombosis and infections are high.496-498 \nMany patients also go into major depression. Thus, extensive discussion with the patient and family is necessary prior to LVAD implantation.8.7 PALLIATIVE AND END OF LIFE CARE\nDespite recent advances in therapy, for some patients, HF remains a \nprogressive disease and carries a poor prognosis. Patients with refractory symptoms despite guideline-directed medical therapy, should be considered for palliative and end of life care if they have the following characteristics:\n499\n Progressive functional decline (mental and physical) and dependence in  \n most activities of daily living.\n Severe HF symptoms with poor quality of life despite optimal pharmacological \n and non-pharmacological therapies.\n Frequent hospital admissions or serious episodes of decompensation  \n despite optimal therapies.\n Heart transplantation and mechanical circulatory support ruled out.\n Cardiac cachexia.\n Clinically judged to be near end of life.\nThe aim of palliative care in HF is to prevent and relieve suffering and to promote the best quality of life for patients and their families.\n500\nDespite the complexities of end-of-life issues in HF patients, there is minimal evidence-based guidance on the care of this population.\n501 The key components \nof end-of-life care are:\n 1. Advanced care plan with directives and informed decisions on:\n   Use or withdrawal of treatment including advanced therapies such  \n   as V inotropes, ICD and mechanical circulatory support. \n   When it would be appropriate to switch off devices such as ICD or  \n   CRT. \n   Resuscitation status.\n   Preferred location of death (i.e. at home or hospital).\n 2. Symptom management \n  Goals of care at this stage should shift from extending life to controlling \n  symptoms and maximising quality of life. Common symptoms include:\n   Dyspnoea\n   Fatigue\n   Pain\n   Urinary retention \n  Constipation\n  Cachexia\n  Depression\n Medications that may be useful include analgesics, antiemetics, anxiolytics,  \n opioids, laxatives, and diuretics, etc. \n3. Psychosocial support\n The impact of HF on quality of life for the patient and family is complex and  \n extends beyond physical symptoms.502\n Emotional, spiritual and social support should be provided to alleviate patient  \n anxiety about dying, and to guide patient towards a peaceful journey at the end  \n of life.\n9.1 LEVEL OF CARE AND SHARED MANAGEMENT \nThe care of patients with HF should ideally take place in a multidisciplinary system, \nallowing for shared care between the hospital (secondary or tertiary settings) and \ncommunity (primary setting). A multidisciplinary approach encompasses patient \neducation, cardiac rehabilitation, psychosocial support and palliative care, and has been proven to reduce HF hospitalisations and mortality in discharged patients.\n503-505\nThe multidisciplinary team usually consists of cardiologists and or general physicians, HF nurses, pharmacists, dieticians, physiotherapists, primary care \nproviders, social workers as well as geriatricians, psychologists, occupational \ntherapists and when necessary, palliative care specialists. Care can be done in two different settings: \n In the patient’s own home - home-based interventions are associated with  \n significantly lower healthcare costs, reduced hospital readmissions and an  \n improvement in the patient’s quality of life.506 This may however, not be feasible  \n in our local setting.\n Specialist outpatient clinic - the Heart Failure Clinic (HFC). \nHFCs can either be:\n Nurse-directed - these are run by nurses with special training in HF.\n Physician-directed - run by general physicians and/or cardiologists. \nHFCs can be established in the tertiary hospitals or in the primary care setting. The minimum human resource requirements are a:\n Cardiologist or general physician with an interest in cardiology and HF, \n Dedicated nurse and \n Medical technologist for blood taking, doing echocardiography and 6 minutes \n walk tests.In bigger clinic settings, the involvement of physiotherapists to encourage physical \nactivity, pharmacists and counsellors for end of life care would be advisable.\nThese clinics will be the intermediary between in-patient hospital care and community \nprimary care. Patients who can be seen in these clinics include those:507\n Recently discharged after an admission for decompensated HF (a waiting \n time of 7-12 days post discharge has to be the maximum wait-time).\n Who are in the early decompensation phase and need treatment modification.\n Who are stable but need uptitration of HF medications.\n With ICD or CRTs. \n With comorbidities, such as renal dysfunction, diabetes and COPD.\n With advanced HF who may benefit from:\n  Heart transplant\n  Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD)\n  Palliative care.\nThe objectives of these HF clinics may vary based on local settings. These include:\n507,508\n Optimisation of medical therapy particularly the uptitration of β-blockers, ACE-I  \n and MRA. \n Education of the patient and caregiver on the nature of the disease and its  \n progression. \n Promotion of self-care such as :\n  Compliance to medical therapy and fluid restriction.\n  Regular weighing and adjusting diuretic doses according to symptoms and  \n  body weight.\nPatient with optimised HF medications/treatment plans can be discharged to the \ncommunity with appropriate care plans to primary care. Close partnership between these HF clinics and primary care helps to reduce unnecessary admissions to hospital. \nIn 2018, the Heart Failure Medication Therapy Adherence Clinic (MTAC) was \nintroduced. These clinics are conducted by pharmacists in collaboration with doctors and other healthcare providers to improve HF management. The objectives of the Heart Failure MTAC are:\n509\n Enhance patient’s adherence to HF pharmacotherapy and non-pharmacological  \n interventions.\n To reduce unscheduled emergency department visits or hospitalisations of HF  \n patient due to acute decompensation.\n To provide consultative service to doctors on evidence-based HF pharmacotherapy  \n and related issues.\n To collaborate with doctors and other health care professionals in HF management  \n program.9.2 MONITORING AND FOLLOW-UP \nPatients with HF require regular follow-up and monitoring. Serial evaluations serve \nto assess a patient’s status, response to therapy, development of complications and disease progression. Key components of assessment include:\n Functional capacity - NYHA functional class or 6-minute walk test \n Fluid status and body weight \n Blood pressure, heart rate and rhythm \n Examination of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems\n Cognitive status and nutritional status \n Review of pharmacotherapy - uptitration, compliance and side effects\n Serum urea, electrolytes, creatinine and eGFR as necessary\n Diet and sodium intake\n Consumption of alcohol or illicit drugs\n Smoking history.\nThe frequency of follow-up will depend on the patient’s clinical stability and need for pharmacotherapy optimisation. A patient with a recent episode of decompensation or clinical instability, for instance, should ideally be seen again soon, usually within 2 weeks. Ultimately, the intensity and type of follow-up would be determined by the local organisation of care and resources.\nRoutine serial echocardiogram is not recommended. However, if there has been a \nrecent change in clinical status or if the patient has received treatment that might significantly change certain echocardiographic parameters, a follow-up echocardiogram is reasonable to assess the LVEF and structural remodeling.\nSerial brain natriuretic peptide measurements to guide and tailor HF therapy cannot \nbe broadly recommended at the present time due to a lack of consistent evidence.\n29-32 \n9.3 CARDIOLOGY REFERRAL \nHF patients with stable symptoms may be managed at the primary care level. \nReferral to the cardiologist should be considered in the following situations: \n De novo HF for a comprehensive workup to confirm the diagnosis and determine  \n the aetiology, and to devise a management plan.\n Episodes of acute decompensation.\n Worsening HF symptoms despite appropriate therapy. \n HF complicated with symptomatic hypotension or excessive bradycardia, limiting \n uptitration of pharmacotherapy. Symptomatic stable CAD and/or acute coronary syndrome for consideration of  \n revascularisation (PCI or CABG). \n Resuscitated cardiac arrest.\n Documented or suspected significant arrhythmias e.g. AF, VT.\n Significant valvular disease not previously assessed or worsening valvular  \n dysfunction.\n Pre-conception assessment and counselling of women with significant structural  \n heart disease and a past history of HF or LV dysfunction. \n Complex congenital cardiac lesions and/or Eisenmenger’s syndrome.\nDespite taking conventional HF therapy, patients may seek alternative therapy and healing approaches that are not considered as allopathic medicine. The National Centre for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) defines complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) as a group of diverse medical and healthcare interventions, practices, products or disciplines that are not generally considered part of conventional medicine.\n10.1 Enhanced External Counter Pulsation (EECP)\nThere is inadequate evidence of clinical effectiveness of EECP in HF.\n510-513 There is \nconcern that it could precipitate or exacerbate HF. \n10.2 Stem cell therapy\nA global position paper on cardiovascular regenerative medicine stated that \ncell-based therapy in HF patients is neither positive nor consistent.514 \n10.3 Omega 3 fatty acids\nIn patients with HFrEF, it may be considered as an adjunctive therapy based on a \nsingle randomised controlled trial (RCT) which showed a small benefit in CV death and/or hospitalisations.\n515,516 10.4 Coenzyme Q10\nThere is no convincing evidence to support or refute the use of coenzyme Q10 for \npatients with HF.517\n10.5 Tai Chi\nTai Chi may improve 6 min walk test distance, quality of life and LVEF in patients with \nHF.518,519 Its effect on hard CV outcomes such as rehospitalisation, MI and mortality \nis not known. \n10.6 YogaA meta-analysis in 2014 that includes two RCTs concluded that yoga improved peak \nVO2 (exercise capacity) and quality of life in chronic HF patients.\n520 There is an \nongoing RCT to look at the effect of yoga in HFpEF patients.521\nThe focus of future development for HF in Malaysia should be towards service \nenhancement working to meet the World Heart Federation mandate of a 25% reduction in premature non-communicable disease mortality by 2025. \nFinding the balance between costs and quality remains a global challenge, and the \nunderstanding of the disease in our healthcare context is imperative to making sure we move forward regarding service delivery, human resource allocation, medical expense costs and patient outcomes. To achieve this, the following need to be undertaken: \n Epidemiological studies to understand the disease profile in the country.\n Establishment and expansion of HFCs leading to more patient-centred HF care.\n Expanding service delivery, human resource allocation, medical expense cost  \n and patient outcomes.\n Education of healthcare personnel.\nEfforts should be directed to the knowledge and understanding of the epidemiology of HF in our country, its phenotype, presentation, current adherence to guideline-directed therapy and outcomes. Regular cluster sampling cohorts or a nationwide registry should be considered. Understanding the limitations of service delivery albeit geography or human resources and making plans for better service delivery systems \nare important.\nDevelopment of HFCs, can lead to a more patient-centric HF care. (See Section 9, Pages 110-113)\nModules for HF care need to be initiated in order to train and educate general \ninternal medicine physicians. A core-curriculum for education needs to be formed to ensure adequate training has been disseminated to HFC personnel.   \nIncentives regarding HF guidelines compliance should be implemented and HF \ninnovative practice should be encouraged with awards for best clinical practice and innovation be made available. \nThis streamline approach to HF care with engagement of connected groups hopefully \nwill help in better overall patient care and experience.\nPerformance measures should be used with the goal of improving quality of care for HF.\n518,519\nProcess performance measures focus on the aspects of care that are delivered to a patient, \nwhile outcome measures focus on the end-points such as mortality or hospitalisation.\nProcess performance indicators for in-patients with HF includes:522-524\n % of patients who had documentation of NYHA Functional Class.\n % of patients who had LVEF measurement.\n % of patients with current or prior LVEF < 40% and without contraindications  \n discharged with ACE-I/ARB. \n % of patients with current or prior LVEF < 40% and without contraindications  \n discharged on β-blockers.\n % of patients with current or prior LVEF < 40% and without contraindications  \n discharged on MRA.\n % of patients with chronic or paroxysmal AF/atrial flutter without contraindications  \n on anticoagulant therapy at discharge.\n % of patients given a post discharge appointment.\nThe accepted performance measure should be more than 60%.Outcome measures indicators include:\n In-hospital mortality\n 30-day readmission for HF\nRefer to Appendix VI, Page 121 for calculation of these measures.Appendix II: Salt Content of Common Malaysian Foods\n  CONTENT OF SODIUM IN FOODS\nLow Content Moderate  High Content\n  Content\nFruit  Meat Flavouring Agents Sauces: Soya Tomato, Vegetables  Fish   Chili Barbeque \nPure Oil  Egg   Tauchioh\nNatural Fats  Milk Extract Vegetable(Marmite)\nSugar   Meat (Bovril)\nPlain Flour  Enhancers Monosodium Glutamate    \nRice   Flavouring cubes\nMost Cereals   Rising Agents Bicarbonate of Soda\nLegumes    Baking Powder\nNuts  Dressing Salad Cream\n    Mayonnaise\n   Processed Food Tinned or Canned Food\n    \n Salted Crisps\n     Salted Nuts\n     Cheese\n     Packed Soup\n     Raising Agents\n   Preserved Food Salted Fish/Eggs Cured \n    Meat Preserved Sausages \n    Vegetables/Fruits Belacan\n   Medication Effervescent Salts\n    Bicarbonate Powder"

        "text": "1188.5.5 CARDIO-ONCOLOGY AND HEART FAILURE\nHeart disease and cancer are often linked due to:\n Common risk factors (e.g. increasing age and cigarette smoking)\n Treatment strategies \n  Chemotherapy drugs has been associated with HF, arrhythmias,  \n  vasculitis and thromboembolic disease.\n  Radiotherapy of the mediastinum and left chest can lead to CAD,  \n  myopericardial fibrosis and valvular dysfunction.\nDyspnoea in cancer patients could be due to:\n Fluid overload.\n Cardiomyopathy due to chemotherapeutic agents, stress (Takotsubo), or  \n underlying CAD.\n The primary cancer causing anaemia, lung and pericardial involvement. \nChemotherapy-induced cardiomyopathy is not common, clinical HF occurs in \n1-5% and an asymptomatic decrease in LV function in the range of 5% to 20%.\n442 Prognosis in the patients who develop HF is poor.443\nThe anthracycline class of chemotherapeutic agents remain the major cause of chemotherapy-induced cardiomyopathy.\n444,445 In the current era, newer \nagents have also been implicated in a reversible form of cardiomyopathy.446 \nChemotherapy-induced cardiomyopathy as defined by the Cardiac Review and Evaluation Committee is the presence of at least one or more of the following:\n447\n1. Cardiomyopathy characterised by a decrease in Ejection Fraction (EF)  \n globally or due to regional changes in interventricular septum contraction. \n2. Symptoms of HF.3. Signs associated with HF including but not limited to S3 gallop, tachycardia,  \n or both.4. Decline in initial EF of at least 5% to < 55% with signs and symptoms of  \n HF or asymptomatic decrease in EF of at least 10% to < 55%.Chemotherapy drugs that have been associated with HF include (Appendix V, Page120):\n Doxorubicin \n  5% at a cumulative dose of 400mg/m2 (the higher the cumulative dose, \n  the greater the risk of HF.445  \n  Even at lower doses of 180 to 240mg/m2, subclinical events can  \n  occur in up to 30% of patients about 13 years post treatment.448\n  These suggest that there is no ‘safe’ dose for doxorubicin. \n Cyclophosphamide especially in high doses and ifosfomide.449,450  \n Newer agents such as monoclonal antibodies (trastuzumab and pertuzumab), \n small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (imatinib, sunitinib, sorafenib)  \n and the proteasome inhibitor (bortezomib).  Trastuzumab especially when administered together with anthracyclines \n  and cyclophosphamide, has been associated with an increased incidence \n  of HF of 27% compared to 1.7% to 4.1% when anthracycline was not part  \n  of the therapeutic regimen.\n451-453 Symptoms are usually mild to moderate \n  and improve following medical management and termination of drug  \n  administration. Improvement is usually seen in about 4-6 weeks after    withdrawal of the agent.\n454-456 After symptomatic improvement, \n  reinstitution  of treatment is usually possible.454-456\n  Vascular endothelial growth factor signaling pathway (VSP) inhibitors  \n  (bevacizumab) can cause hypertension. Bevacizumab also blocks  \n  receptors that are involved in the compensatory response to stress in  \n  the cardiomyocytes and when the heart is unable to compensate for  \n  the hypertension, it could lead to HF.457,458 Maintaining good blood pressure \n  control can prevent HF associated with this agent. Heart failure due to  \n  VSP inhibitors is usually reversible with cessation of the agent.459\nOne must consider both the efficacy and the toxicity in choosing chemotherapeutic agents. Many of the newer targeted agents cause a reversible form of HF and symptoms usually resolve after the initiation of anti-failure medications.\n454-456,459,460 \nRisk factors for anthracycline toxicity include: 461-465\n The total cumulative dose\n Intravenous bolus administration versus infusion\n Higher single doses\n History of prior irradiation\n Use of concomitant agents known to have cardiotoxicity\n Female gender\n Underlying CV disease\n Age (young and elderly)\n An increase in cardiac biomarkers such as troponins during and   after administration is an indication of toxicity.8.5.5.1 Management\n Patients undergoing chemotherapy should have a careful clinical evaluation \n and assessment and treatment of CV risk factors.464,465\n Blood pressure control is important in all patients especially in those  \n being considered for VSP inhibitors.\n All patients with potential cardiotoxic chemotherapy should have an  \n echocardiogram prior to treatment. An important parameter is the LVEF  \n determined using the biplane method of discs (Simpson’s method) or  \n three-dimensional echocardiography where available. Newer techniques   to detect and quantitate regional and global myocardial dysfunction  \n (strain assessment with global longitudinal strain) can be used to detect  \n pre-clinical and subtle changes in function.\n466-469 \n Biomarkers such as troponin and natriuretic peptides can help identify  \n patients at higher risk.462,463,470,471 \nClose collaboration between the oncologist and the cardiologist is important. \nFor the oncologists, the strategy (prior to commencement) includes:465\n Identifying high risk patients (pre-existing heart disease, presence of  \n CV risk factors, age - young and old, female gender, use of high dose  \n anthracycline regimens).\n High risk patients should:\n  Have a pre-treatment cardiac function evaluation. If the LVEF is < 50%,  \n  refer to the cardiologist.  Be considered for non-cardiotoxic alternatives. \n  Have their therapy protocols adjusted where necessary (e.g. reduction \n  in doses, continuous infusions rather than bolus injections, liposomal    doxorubicin, dexrazoxane etc). \nFor the cardiologists/general physicians, the strategy includes:\n Treating CV risk factors. \n Assessing, repeating (if necessary) imaging studies. (e.g. using high  \n quality LVEF measurement, strain evaluation etc).\n Assessing cardiac biomarkers (troponin and/or NP).\n Considering cardio-protection prior to/or during treatment using β-blockers,  \n MRA and/or ACE-I/ARB if:69,465,472-474\n  EF < 50%, \n  EF drops by > 10%\n  Abnormal global longitudinal strain (GLS) (> 15% drop).  Monitoring LVEF during therapy is important with repeat echocardiography  \n at 3-monthly intervals and/or according to symptoms. If cardioprotective  \n medications are given, monitoring may be necessary at closer intervals of  \n time depending on the clinical condition of the patient e.g. 1-monthly interval. \n Withholding cardiotoxic therapy only as a last resort. (for anthracycline  \n LVEF < 45%, for anti-HER2 therapy LVEF < 40%).\n Monitoring even after completion of therapy:\n  Obtain post therapy LVEF.\n  Repeat echocardiography in 6 months or 1 year. Most cases of  \n  treatment-associated cardiac dysfunction develop within the first year  \n  after completion of therapy.475,476 \n  If EF remains abnormal, follow guidelines for management of HF.465 \n \n8.5.6 HEART FAILURE AND KIDNEY DYSFUNCTION\n8.5.6.1 Epidemiology, definitions and classifications Cardiac and pre-existing kidney disease at admission frequently co-exist, \nvarying from 45.4% in patients with chronic HF to > 60% in those with AHF.\n477,478 \nIn addition, during treatment of AHF, a significant proportion of patients will develop varying degrees of worsening renal function (WRF).\nThe definition of WRF is:\n479\n An increase in serum creatinine by ≥ 26.5μmol/ L (0.3mg/dl) and/or\n A ≥ 25% increase in serum creatinine or a ≥ 20% drop in eGFR.\nThe rise in serum creatinine usually occurs in the first three to five days of \nhospitalisation. The incidence of WRF is estimated to be between 19 and 45%.165 This large \nobserved range is due to variations in the definitions of WRF, the observed time-at-risk and the study population.\n165 \nRisk factors for WRF during admission for HF include:480\n A prior history of HF or diabetes, \n An admission serum creatinine of > 133μmol/L,  or \n Systolic blood pressure > 160mmHg. \nWRF may fulfill criteria for type 1 or type 2 cardiorenal syndrome (CRS). The term “cardiorenal syndrome” refers to disorders of the heart and kidneys whereby acute or chronic dysfunction in one organ may induce acute or chronic dysfunction of the other.\n165 \nThis syndrome has been classified by the Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative working group into 5 subtypes as shown in Table 17, Page 105.\n165 Many \npatients however, may belong to more than one subtype and may move between subtypes during the course of their disease.\n165\n8.5.6.2. Pathogenesis of CRS \nMultiple mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of CRS. These include:\n Increased renal venous pressure  - venous congestion is probably the  \n most important factor.481 \n RV dysfunction.\n Reduced renal perfusion with reduced cardiac output. \n Neurohumoral adaptations (e.g. activation of the sympathetic nervous  \n system and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, increases in  \n vasopressin and endothelin-1).8.5.6.3  Clinical significance /Impact of kidney dysfunction in HF  The combination of cardiac and kidney disease increases the complexity and \ncosts of care, and may interact to worsen prognosis. \nA. Pharmacologic considerations \n Safety:\n  Dosing of renally-excreted cardiac drugs need adjustment in the  \n  presence of renal impairment (e.g. digoxin, insulin, low molecular  \n  weight heparin).\n  Patients with HF are at increased risk of contrast-induced acute kidney \n  injury. \n Efficacy:\n  Impaired renal function will affect drug choices and dosing. If eGFR <  \n  30mls/min/1.73m2, most thiazide diuretics are no longer effective and  \n  loop diuretics are preferred. Higher doses of loop diuretics may be   \n  required with increasing renal impairment.             B. Prognostic implications\n Preexisting CKD is a bad prognostic indicator in patients with HF - the  \n more severe the CKD, the worse the mortality.482,483\n In patients with HF, WRF may not always indicate a poor outcome.484 The  \n prognostic value of WRF is mainly determined by:   The presence of persistent congestion  \n  Baseline renal function and magnitude of renal changes \n  Duration - persistent WRF is usually associated with hemodynamic  \n  derangements and poor prognosis as compared with transient WRF  \n  as a result of agressive decongestive therapy.485-487\nTable 17: Classification of Cardiorenal Syndrome (CRS)8.5.6.4. Management \n A multi-disciplinary approach is recommended. Early referral to a  \n nephrologist is advisable.   \n Exclude potentially reversible causes for increasing renal dysfunction  \n such as hyper - or hypovolaemia, concomitant medications such as  \n aminoglycosides and NSAIDs, ACE-I or ARB and renal artery stenosis. \n Closely monitor electrolytes and kidney function, especially during acute  \n illnesses, dehydration and when increasing doses of cardiac drugs  \n including diuretics. The baseline renal function will determine how frequently \n this should be done. \n The recommended range for serum potassium is 4-5.5mmol/L.488 \n Wherever possible, avoid nephrotoxins, e.g. contrast media for angiography\n Intravenous diuretics \n  Loop diuretics are the first choice.\n  Continuous infusion may not have greater benefits compared with  \n  bolus dosing.115-118,489\n  Start initially with 2-2.5 times the usual oral dose. \n  Combination therapy (loop diuretic and thiazide/thiazide-like diuretic/\n  mineralocorticoid) may be required to enhance diuresis.205-207 However,  \n  care is required to avoid electrolyte disturbances, hypovolaemia and  \n  worsening renal dysfunction. \n Careful use of Renin Angiotensin System (RAS) blockers  \n  HF patients with stable, chronic mild-moderate renal insufficiency  \n  (eGFR > 30mls/min/1.73m2) should receive standard therapy with an  \n  ACE-I/ ARB and an MRA.490\n  A serum creatinine rise or GFR decrease by up to 30% from baseline  \n  may be acceptable before it becomes necessary to consider stopping  \n  or decreasing doses.221 \n  In patients with advanced renal failure, the decision to start or stop  \n  RAS blockers should be individualised.490\n  Consider withholding RAS blockers during aggressive diuresis in  \n  patients at high risk for WRF.  RAS blockers (and β-blockers) can be used in patients with HF who  \n  are on chronic dialysis therapy.\n Ultrafiltration \n  This involves the removal of plasma water across a semi-permeable  \n  membrane in response to a transmembrane pressure gradient.   It may be considered for congestive symptoms refractory to diuresis,  \n  but should be used in consultation with a nephrologist.\n491\n  Evidence for its efficacy in fluid removal is mixed at present.491  Haemodialysis \n  Criteria for possible need to initiate renal replacement therapy include:\n   Oliguria unresponsive to fluid resuscitation.\n   Severe hyperkalaemia (serum potassium > 6.5mmol/L).\n   Severe acidaemia (pH < 7.2). \n   Serum urea > 25mmol/L. \n    Serum creatinine > 300μmol/L. \n8.6  ADVANCED HEART FAILURE/REFRACTORY HEART FAILURE\nThese are patients with severe symptoms of HF despite maximal medical \ntherapy. Hospital admission is necessary for stabilisation. Meticulous control of fluid balance is important. Aggravating causes of HF as listed in Table 5, Page 39 should be identified and treated.\nThese patients may need specialised treatment in CCU or ICU. The following \nmay be required:\n Intravenous infusion of frusemide. These patients may require combination  \n loop diuretics and thiazides.\n Intravenous infusion of inotropes - low dose dobutamine (5mcg/kg/min) or  \n milrinone. These improve symptoms but no survival benefit has been  \n demonstrated.126,492\n Ultrafiltration in patients who are fluid overloaded.493 In most patients,  \n however, the relief is temporary.\nThe prognosis of these patients is poor. They should be referred to assess \nwhether they may be potential candidates for mechanical circulatory support (e.g. LVAD) and consideration for heart transplant.\n8.6.1 HEART TRANSPLANTHeart transplantation is a well-established treatment of refractory end stage \nHF. This definitive therapy for HF however is limited by the lack of donor organs.\n494,495All patients with severe symptomatic HF despite optimal medical therapy and no other alternative therapy option should be considered for heart transplant. They need to be referred to a HF specialist cardiac hospital for further evaluation.\nAssessment for heart transplant is done by a multispeciality, multidisciplinary \nteam and appropriate work up will be performed for eligibility.\nEligibility criteria to be considered for heart transplant include:\n Poor LVEF (< 25%).\n Recurrent HF hospitalisations.\n Major limitation of the patient’s daily activities.\n Poor effort tolerance i.e. peak VO2 (maximal oxygen consumption or  \n peak oxygen uptake) less than 10ml/kg/min (or < 50% predicted). VO2  \n max is the maximum rate of oxygen consumption measured during  \n incremental exercise ie exercise of increasing intensity and is widely  \n used as an indicator of cardiorespiratory fitness.\n Intravenous inotropic dependence for symptomatic relief or to maintain  \n end organ function.\n Motivated, psychologically stable and compliant to therapy.\nContraindications to heart transplant\n Active infection.\n Severe peripheral arterial or cerebrovascular disease.\n Malignancy within 5 years.\n Diabetes mellitus with widespread microvascular complications.\n Systemic disease with multi-organ dysfunction.\n Irreversible chronic kidney, liver or lung disease.\n Pharmacologically irreversible pulmonary hypertension.\n Other medical or psychosocial issues that would impact survival.\n8.6.2 MECHANICAL CIRCULATORY SUPPORT The use of mechanical circulatory support (e.g. LVAD), should be considered \nfor patients with potentially reversible or treatable conditions or as a bridge to heart transplant in suitable candidates.\nLVAD may also be used as destination therapy in candidates who are not \nsuitable for transplant. Patients have improvement in their symptoms when compared to optimal medical therapy.\n496,497 However, the rate of rehospitalisations \ndue to complications of bleeding, thrombosis and infections are high.496-498 \nMany patients also go into major depression. Thus, extensive discussion with the patient and family is necessary prior to LVAD implantation.8.7 PALLIATIVE AND END OF LIFE CARE\nDespite recent advances in therapy, for some patients, HF remains a \nprogressive disease and carries a poor prognosis. Patients with refractory symptoms despite guideline-directed medical therapy, should be considered for palliative and end of life care if they have the following characteristics:\n499\n Progressive functional decline (mental and physical) and dependence in  \n most activities of daily living.\n Severe HF symptoms with poor quality of life despite optimal pharmacological \n and non-pharmacological therapies.\n Frequent hospital admissions or serious episodes of decompensation  \n despite optimal therapies.\n Heart transplantation and mechanical circulatory support ruled out.\n Cardiac cachexia.\n Clinically judged to be near end of life.\nThe aim of palliative care in HF is to prevent and relieve suffering and to promote the best quality of life for patients and their families.\n500\nDespite the complexities of end-of-life issues in HF patients, there is minimal evidence-based guidance on the care of this population.\n501 The key components \nof end-of-life care are:\n 1. Advanced care plan with directives and informed decisions on:\n   Use or withdrawal of treatment including advanced therapies such  \n   as V inotropes, ICD and mechanical circulatory support. \n   When it would be appropriate to switch off devices such as ICD or  \n   CRT. \n   Resuscitation status.\n   Preferred location of death (i.e. at home or hospital).\n 2. Symptom management \n  Goals of care at this stage should shift from extending life to controlling \n  symptoms and maximising quality of life. Common symptoms include:\n   Dyspnoea\n   Fatigue\n   Pain\n   Urinary retention \n  Constipation\n  Cachexia\n  Depression\n Medications that may be useful include analgesics, antiemetics, anxiolytics,  \n opioids, laxatives, and diuretics, etc. \n3. Psychosocial support\n The impact of HF on quality of life for the patient and family is complex and  \n extends beyond physical symptoms.502\n Emotional, spiritual and social support should be provided to alleviate patient  \n anxiety about dying, and to guide patient towards a peaceful journey at the end  \n of life.\n9.1 LEVEL OF CARE AND SHARED MANAGEMENT \nThe care of patients with HF should ideally take place in a multidisciplinary system, \nallowing for shared care between the hospital (secondary or tertiary settings) and \ncommunity (primary setting). A multidisciplinary approach encompasses patient \neducation, cardiac rehabilitation, psychosocial support and palliative care, and has been proven to reduce HF hospitalisations and mortality in discharged patients.\n503-505\nThe multidisciplinary team usually consists of cardiologists and or general physicians, HF nurses, pharmacists, dieticians, physiotherapists, primary care \nproviders, social workers as well as geriatricians, psychologists, occupational \ntherapists and when necessary, palliative care specialists. Care can be done in two different settings: \n In the patient’s own home - home-based interventions are associated with  \n significantly lower healthcare costs, reduced hospital readmissions and an  \n improvement in the patient’s quality of life.506 This may however, not be feasible  \n in our local setting.\n Specialist outpatient clinic - the Heart Failure Clinic (HFC). \nHFCs can either be:\n Nurse-directed - these are run by nurses with special training in HF.\n Physician-directed - run by general physicians and/or cardiologists. \nHFCs can be established in the tertiary hospitals or in the primary care setting. The minimum human resource requirements are a:\n Cardiologist or general physician with an interest in cardiology and HF, \n Dedicated nurse and \n Medical technologist for blood taking, doing echocardiography and 6 minutes \n walk tests.In bigger clinic settings, the involvement of physiotherapists to encourage physical \nactivity, pharmacists and counsellors for end of life care would be advisable.\nThese clinics will be the intermediary between in-patient hospital care and community \nprimary care. Patients who can be seen in these clinics include those:507\n Recently discharged after an admission for decompensated HF (a waiting \n time of 7-12 days post discharge has to be the maximum wait-time).\n Who are in the early decompensation phase and need treatment modification.\n Who are stable but need uptitration of HF medications.\n With ICD or CRTs. \n With comorbidities, such as renal dysfunction, diabetes and COPD.\n With advanced HF who may benefit from:\n  Heart transplant\n  Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD)\n  Palliative care.\nThe objectives of these HF clinics may vary based on local settings. These include:\n507,508\n Optimisation of medical therapy particularly the uptitration of β-blockers, ACE-I  \n and MRA. \n Education of the patient and caregiver on the nature of the disease and its  \n progression. \n Promotion of self-care such as :\n  Compliance to medical therapy and fluid restriction.\n  Regular weighing and adjusting diuretic doses according to symptoms and  \n  body weight.\nPatient with optimised HF medications/treatment plans can be discharged to the \ncommunity with appropriate care plans to primary care. Close partnership between these HF clinics and primary care helps to reduce unnecessary admissions to hospital. \nIn 2018, the Heart Failure Medication Therapy Adherence Clinic (MTAC) was \nintroduced. These clinics are conducted by pharmacists in collaboration with doctors and other healthcare providers to improve HF management. The objectives of the Heart Failure MTAC are:\n509\n Enhance patient’s adherence to HF pharmacotherapy and non-pharmacological  \n interventions.\n To reduce unscheduled emergency department visits or hospitalisations of HF  \n patient due to acute decompensation.\n To provide consultative service to doctors on evidence-based HF pharmacotherapy  \n and related issues.\n To collaborate with doctors and other health care professionals in HF management  \n program.9.2 MONITORING AND FOLLOW-UP \nPatients with HF require regular follow-up and monitoring. Serial evaluations serve \nto assess a patient’s status, response to therapy, development of complications and disease progression. Key components of assessment include:\n Functional capacity - NYHA functional class or 6-minute walk test \n Fluid status and body weight \n Blood pressure, heart rate and rhythm \n Examination of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems\n Cognitive status and nutritional status \n Review of pharmacotherapy - uptitration, compliance and side effects\n Serum urea, electrolytes, creatinine and eGFR as necessary\n Diet and sodium intake\n Consumption of alcohol or illicit drugs\n Smoking history.\nThe frequency of follow-up will depend on the patient’s clinical stability and need for pharmacotherapy optimisation. A patient with a recent episode of decompensation or clinical instability, for instance, should ideally be seen again soon, usually within 2 weeks. Ultimately, the intensity and type of follow-up would be determined by the local organisation of care and resources.\nRoutine serial echocardiogram is not recommended. However, if there has been a \nrecent change in clinical status or if the patient has received treatment that might significantly change certain echocardiographic parameters, a follow-up echocardiogram is reasonable to assess the LVEF and structural remodeling.\nSerial brain natriuretic peptide measurements to guide and tailor HF therapy cannot \nbe broadly recommended at the present time due to a lack of consistent evidence.\n29-32 \n9.3 CARDIOLOGY REFERRAL \nHF patients with stable symptoms may be managed at the primary care level. \nReferral to the cardiologist should be considered in the following situations: \n De novo HF for a comprehensive workup to confirm the diagnosis and determine  \n the aetiology, and to devise a management plan.\n Episodes of acute decompensation.\n Worsening HF symptoms despite appropriate therapy. \n HF complicated with symptomatic hypotension or excessive bradycardia, limiting \n uptitration of pharmacotherapy. Symptomatic stable CAD and/or acute coronary syndrome for consideration of  \n revascularisation (PCI or CABG). \n Resuscitated cardiac arrest.\n Documented or suspected significant arrhythmias e.g. AF, VT.\n Significant valvular disease not previously assessed or worsening valvular  \n dysfunction.\n Pre-conception assessment and counselling of women with significant structural  \n heart disease and a past history of HF or LV dysfunction. \n Complex congenital cardiac lesions and/or Eisenmenger’s syndrome.\nDespite taking conventional HF therapy, patients may seek alternative therapy and healing approaches that are not considered as allopathic medicine. The National Centre for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) defines complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) as a group of diverse medical and healthcare interventions, practices, products or disciplines that are not generally considered part of conventional medicine.\n10.1 Enhanced External Counter Pulsation (EECP)\nThere is inadequate evidence of clinical effectiveness of EECP in HF.\n510-513 There is \nconcern that it could precipitate or exacerbate HF. \n10.2 Stem cell therapy\nA global position paper on cardiovascular regenerative medicine stated that \ncell-based therapy in HF patients is neither positive nor consistent.514 \n10.3 Omega 3 fatty acids\nIn patients with HFrEF, it may be considered as an adjunctive therapy based on a \nsingle randomised controlled trial (RCT) which showed a small benefit in CV death and/or hospitalisations.\n515,516 10.4 Coenzyme Q10\nThere is no convincing evidence to support or refute the use of coenzyme Q10 for \npatients with HF.517\n10.5 Tai Chi\nTai Chi may improve 6 min walk test distance, quality of life and LVEF in patients with \nHF.518,519 Its effect on hard CV outcomes such as rehospitalisation, MI and mortality \nis not known. \n10.6 YogaA meta-analysis in 2014 that includes two RCTs concluded that yoga improved peak \nVO2 (exercise capacity) and quality of life in chronic HF patients.\n520 There is an \nongoing RCT to look at the effect of yoga in HFpEF patients.521\nThe focus of future development for HF in Malaysia should be towards service \nenhancement working to meet the World Heart Federation mandate of a 25% reduction in premature non-communicable disease mortality by 2025. \nFinding the balance between costs and quality remains a global challenge, and the \nunderstanding of the disease in our healthcare context is imperative to making sure we move forward regarding service delivery, human resource allocation, medical expense costs and patient outcomes. To achieve this, the following need to be undertaken: \n Epidemiological studies to understand the disease profile in the country.\n Establishment and expansion of HFCs leading to more patient-centred HF care.\n Expanding service delivery, human resource allocation, medical expense cost  \n and patient outcomes.\n Education of healthcare personnel.\nEfforts should be directed to the knowledge and understanding of the epidemiology of HF in our country, its phenotype, presentation, current adherence to guideline-directed therapy and outcomes. Regular cluster sampling cohorts or a nationwide registry should be considered. Understanding the limitations of service delivery albeit geography or human resources and making plans for better service delivery systems \nare important.\nDevelopment of HFCs, can lead to a more patient-centric HF care. (See Section 9, Pages 110-113)\nModules for HF care need to be initiated in order to train and educate general \ninternal medicine physicians. A core-curriculum for education needs to be formed to ensure adequate training has been disseminated to HFC personnel.   \nIncentives regarding HF guidelines compliance should be implemented and HF \ninnovative practice should be encouraged with awards for best clinical practice and innovation be made available. \nThis streamline approach to HF care with engagement of connected groups hopefully \nwill help in better overall patient care and experience.\nPerformance measures should be used with the goal of improving quality of care for HF.\n518,519\nProcess performance measures focus on the aspects of care that are delivered to a patient, \nwhile outcome measures focus on the end-points such as mortality or hospitalisation.\nProcess performance indicators for in-patients with HF includes:522-524\n % of patients who had documentation of NYHA Functional Class.\n % of patients who had LVEF measurement.\n % of patients with current or prior LVEF < 40% and without contraindications  \n discharged with ACE-I/ARB. \n % of patients with current or prior LVEF < 40% and without contraindications  \n discharged on β-blockers.\n % of patients with current or prior LVEF < 40% and without contraindications  \n discharged on MRA.\n % of patients with chronic or paroxysmal AF/atrial flutter without contraindications  \n on anticoagulant therapy at discharge.\n % of patients given a post discharge appointment.\nThe accepted performance measure should be more than 60%.Outcome measures indicators include:\n In-hospital mortality\n 30-day readmission for HF\nRefer to Appendix VI, Page 121 for calculation of these measures.Appendix III: Risk of Combined Contraceptive Pills for the Different Cardiac Conditions \nWHOMEC Risk Classification for the Use of Combined Hormonal Contraceptives*\nMEC CLASS WHOMEC  1 WHOMEC  2 WHOMEC 3 WHOMEC 4\nCategory  Condition with no   Condition where the  Condition where the  Conditions where \nof Use restriction for the use  advantages of the  risks of the method  the method represents  Cardiac  of contraceptive  method generally  usually outweigh the  an unacceptable Conditions method  outweigh the risks advantages and to  health risk \n    consider all alternatives first\n  Always usable Broadly usable Caution in use Do not use\n  Physiological  murmurs  Most arrhythmias  Atrial fibrillation or   Atrial fibrillation or   in absence of heart  otherthan atrial   flutter on warfarin flutter if not   disease fibrillation and flutter  anticoagulated\n  Mitral valve prolapse Uncomplicated mild   Bi-leaflet mechanical  \nPulmonary hypertension  \n  with or trivial mitral  native mitral and  valve in mitral or aortic or pulmonary vascular   regurgitation aortic valve disease position taking warfarin disease (e.g. \n     \nEisenmenger syndrome)\n  Bicuspid aortic valve  Tissue prosthetic valve  ASD with left to right  Dilated left atrium \n  with normal function lacking any of the  shunt that may reverse  > 4 cm\n   features noted in  with physiological stress \n   WHOMEC 3 and  (e.g. Valsalva \n   WHOMEC 4 manoeuvre)  \n  Mild pulmonary stenosis Surgically corrected  Marfan syndrome with  Fontan heart on    congenital heart disease  aortic dilatation  warfarin\n   lacking any features   unoperated\n   noted in WHOMEC 3 \n   and WHOMEC 4  \nCardiac  Repaired coarctation Small left to right shunt  Past thrombotic event  Cyanotic heart disease Conditions with no hypertension  not reversible with  on Warfarin\n  or aneurysm physiological \n   manoeuvres (e.g. small  \n   VSD, small PDA)   \n  Simple congenital     Pulmonary arteriovenous \n  lesions successfully    malformation\n  repaired in childhood   and with no sequelae    Past thromboembolic  \n  e.g.   event (venous and\n  \n Ostium secundum  Uncomplicated Marfan  arterial) not on warfarin \n             atrial septal defect syndrome  \n    VSD   Poor left ventricle\n    PDA   function of any cause \n    Total anomalous     (e.g. dilated \n   pulmonary venous    cardiomyopathy)\n   drainage   Ejection fraction < 30%\n   Hypertrophic   Coronary artery disease\n   cardiomyopathy lacking \n   any of the features \n   noted in WHOMEC 3 \n   and WHOMEC 4  \n   Past cardiomyopathy  Coronary arteritis (e.g   \n   fully recovered including   Kawasaki’s disease \n   peripartum cardiomyopathy   with coronary involvement \n     \n*World Health Organization.

        "text": "1198.5.5 CARDIO-ONCOLOGY AND HEART FAILURE\nHeart disease and cancer are often linked due to:\n Common risk factors (e.g. increasing age and cigarette smoking)\n Treatment strategies \n  Chemotherapy drugs has been associated with HF, arrhythmias,  \n  vasculitis and thromboembolic disease.\n  Radiotherapy of the mediastinum and left chest can lead to CAD,  \n  myopericardial fibrosis and valvular dysfunction.\nDyspnoea in cancer patients could be due to:\n Fluid overload.\n Cardiomyopathy due to chemotherapeutic agents, stress (Takotsubo), or  \n underlying CAD.\n The primary cancer causing anaemia, lung and pericardial involvement. \nChemotherapy-induced cardiomyopathy is not common, clinical HF occurs in \n1-5% and an asymptomatic decrease in LV function in the range of 5% to 20%.\n442 Prognosis in the patients who develop HF is poor.443\nThe anthracycline class of chemotherapeutic agents remain the major cause of chemotherapy-induced cardiomyopathy.\n444,445 In the current era, newer \nagents have also been implicated in a reversible form of cardiomyopathy.446 \nChemotherapy-induced cardiomyopathy as defined by the Cardiac Review and Evaluation Committee is the presence of at least one or more of the following:\n447\n1. Cardiomyopathy characterised by a decrease in Ejection Fraction (EF)  \n globally or due to regional changes in interventricular septum contraction. \n2. Symptoms of HF.3. Signs associated with HF including but not limited to S3 gallop, tachycardia,  \n or both.4. Decline in initial EF of at least 5% to < 55% with signs and symptoms of  \n HF or asymptomatic decrease in EF of at least 10% to < 55%.Chemotherapy drugs that have been associated with HF include (Appendix V, Page120):\n Doxorubicin \n  5% at a cumulative dose of 400mg/m2 (the higher the cumulative dose, \n  the greater the risk of HF.445  \n  Even at lower doses of 180 to 240mg/m2, subclinical events can  \n  occur in up to 30% of patients about 13 years post treatment.448\n  These suggest that there is no ‘safe’ dose for doxorubicin. \n Cyclophosphamide especially in high doses and ifosfomide.449,450  \n Newer agents such as monoclonal antibodies (trastuzumab and pertuzumab), \n small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (imatinib, sunitinib, sorafenib)  \n and the proteasome inhibitor (bortezomib).  Trastuzumab especially when administered together with anthracyclines \n  and cyclophosphamide, has been associated with an increased incidence \n  of HF of 27% compared to 1.7% to 4.1% when anthracycline was not part  \n  of the therapeutic regimen.\n451-453 Symptoms are usually mild to moderate \n  and improve following medical management and termination of drug  \n  administration. Improvement is usually seen in about 4-6 weeks after    withdrawal of the agent.\n454-456 After symptomatic improvement, \n  reinstitution  of treatment is usually possible.454-456\n  Vascular endothelial growth factor signaling pathway (VSP) inhibitors  \n  (bevacizumab) can cause hypertension. Bevacizumab also blocks  \n  receptors that are involved in the compensatory response to stress in  \n  the cardiomyocytes and when the heart is unable to compensate for  \n  the hypertension, it could lead to HF.457,458 Maintaining good blood pressure \n  control can prevent HF associated with this agent. Heart failure due to  \n  VSP inhibitors is usually reversible with cessation of the agent.459\nOne must consider both the efficacy and the toxicity in choosing chemotherapeutic agents. Many of the newer targeted agents cause a reversible form of HF and symptoms usually resolve after the initiation of anti-failure medications.\n454-456,459,460 \nRisk factors for anthracycline toxicity include: 461-465\n The total cumulative dose\n Intravenous bolus administration versus infusion\n Higher single doses\n History of prior irradiation\n Use of concomitant agents known to have cardiotoxicity\n Female gender\n Underlying CV disease\n Age (young and elderly)\n An increase in cardiac biomarkers such as troponins during and   after administration is an indication of toxicity.8.5.5.1 Management\n Patients undergoing chemotherapy should have a careful clinical evaluation \n and assessment and treatment of CV risk factors.464,465\n Blood pressure control is important in all patients especially in those  \n being considered for VSP inhibitors.\n All patients with potential cardiotoxic chemotherapy should have an  \n echocardiogram prior to treatment. An important parameter is the LVEF  \n determined using the biplane method of discs (Simpson’s method) or  \n three-dimensional echocardiography where available. Newer techniques   to detect and quantitate regional and global myocardial dysfunction  \n (strain assessment with global longitudinal strain) can be used to detect  \n pre-clinical and subtle changes in function.\n466-469 \n Biomarkers such as troponin and natriuretic peptides can help identify  \n patients at higher risk.462,463,470,471 \nClose collaboration between the oncologist and the cardiologist is important. \nFor the oncologists, the strategy (prior to commencement) includes:465\n Identifying high risk patients (pre-existing heart disease, presence of  \n CV risk factors, age - young and old, female gender, use of high dose  \n anthracycline regimens).\n High risk patients should:\n  Have a pre-treatment cardiac function evaluation. If the LVEF is < 50%,  \n  refer to the cardiologist.  Be considered for non-cardiotoxic alternatives. \n  Have their therapy protocols adjusted where necessary (e.g. reduction \n  in doses, continuous infusions rather than bolus injections, liposomal    doxorubicin, dexrazoxane etc). \nFor the cardiologists/general physicians, the strategy includes:\n Treating CV risk factors. \n Assessing, repeating (if necessary) imaging studies. (e.g. using high  \n quality LVEF measurement, strain evaluation etc).\n Assessing cardiac biomarkers (troponin and/or NP).\n Considering cardio-protection prior to/or during treatment using β-blockers,  \n MRA and/or ACE-I/ARB if:69,465,472-474\n  EF < 50%, \n  EF drops by > 10%\n  Abnormal global longitudinal strain (GLS) (> 15% drop).  Monitoring LVEF during therapy is important with repeat echocardiography  \n at 3-monthly intervals and/or according to symptoms. If cardioprotective  \n medications are given, monitoring may be necessary at closer intervals of  \n time depending on the clinical condition of the patient e.g. 1-monthly interval. \n Withholding cardiotoxic therapy only as a last resort. (for anthracycline  \n LVEF < 45%, for anti-HER2 therapy LVEF < 40%).\n Monitoring even after completion of therapy:\n  Obtain post therapy LVEF.\n  Repeat echocardiography in 6 months or 1 year. Most cases of  \n  treatment-associated cardiac dysfunction develop within the first year  \n  after completion of therapy.475,476 \n  If EF remains abnormal, follow guidelines for management of HF.465 \n \n8.5.6 HEART FAILURE AND KIDNEY DYSFUNCTION\n8.5.6.1 Epidemiology, definitions and classifications Cardiac and pre-existing kidney disease at admission frequently co-exist, \nvarying from 45.4% in patients with chronic HF to > 60% in those with AHF.\n477,478 \nIn addition, during treatment of AHF, a significant proportion of patients will develop varying degrees of worsening renal function (WRF).\nThe definition of WRF is:\n479\n An increase in serum creatinine by ≥ 26.5μmol/ L (0.3mg/dl) and/or\n A ≥ 25% increase in serum creatinine or a ≥ 20% drop in eGFR.\nThe rise in serum creatinine usually occurs in the first three to five days of \nhospitalisation. The incidence of WRF is estimated to be between 19 and 45%.165 This large \nobserved range is due to variations in the definitions of WRF, the observed time-at-risk and the study population.\n165 \nRisk factors for WRF during admission for HF include:480\n A prior history of HF or diabetes, \n An admission serum creatinine of > 133μmol/L,  or \n Systolic blood pressure > 160mmHg. \nWRF may fulfill criteria for type 1 or type 2 cardiorenal syndrome (CRS). The term “cardiorenal syndrome” refers to disorders of the heart and kidneys whereby acute or chronic dysfunction in one organ may induce acute or chronic dysfunction of the other.\n165 \nThis syndrome has been classified by the Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative working group into 5 subtypes as shown in Table 17, Page 105.\n165 Many \npatients however, may belong to more than one subtype and may move between subtypes during the course of their disease.\n165\n8.5.6.2. Pathogenesis of CRS \nMultiple mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of CRS. These include:\n Increased renal venous pressure  - venous congestion is probably the  \n most important factor.481 \n RV dysfunction.\n Reduced renal perfusion with reduced cardiac output. \n Neurohumoral adaptations (e.g. activation of the sympathetic nervous  \n system and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, increases in  \n vasopressin and endothelin-1).8.5.6.3  Clinical significance /Impact of kidney dysfunction in HF  The combination of cardiac and kidney disease increases the complexity and \ncosts of care, and may interact to worsen prognosis. \nA. Pharmacologic considerations \n Safety:\n  Dosing of renally-excreted cardiac drugs need adjustment in the  \n  presence of renal impairment (e.g. digoxin, insulin, low molecular  \n  weight heparin).\n  Patients with HF are at increased risk of contrast-induced acute kidney \n  injury. \n Efficacy:\n  Impaired renal function will affect drug choices and dosing. If eGFR <  \n  30mls/min/1.73m2, most thiazide diuretics are no longer effective and  \n  loop diuretics are preferred. Higher doses of loop diuretics may be   \n  required with increasing renal impairment.             B. Prognostic implications\n Preexisting CKD is a bad prognostic indicator in patients with HF - the  \n more severe the CKD, the worse the mortality.482,483\n In patients with HF, WRF may not always indicate a poor outcome.484 The  \n prognostic value of WRF is mainly determined by:   The presence of persistent congestion  \n  Baseline renal function and magnitude of renal changes \n  Duration - persistent WRF is usually associated with hemodynamic  \n  derangements and poor prognosis as compared with transient WRF  \n  as a result of agressive decongestive therapy.485-487\nTable 17: Classification of Cardiorenal Syndrome (CRS)8.5.6.4. Management \n A multi-disciplinary approach is recommended. Early referral to a  \n nephrologist is advisable.   \n Exclude potentially reversible causes for increasing renal dysfunction  \n such as hyper - or hypovolaemia, concomitant medications such as  \n aminoglycosides and NSAIDs, ACE-I or ARB and renal artery stenosis. \n Closely monitor electrolytes and kidney function, especially during acute  \n illnesses, dehydration and when increasing doses of cardiac drugs  \n including diuretics. The baseline renal function will determine how frequently \n this should be done. \n The recommended range for serum potassium is 4-5.5mmol/L.488 \n Wherever possible, avoid nephrotoxins, e.g. contrast media for angiography\n Intravenous diuretics \n  Loop diuretics are the first choice.\n  Continuous infusion may not have greater benefits compared with  \n  bolus dosing.115-118,489\n  Start initially with 2-2.5 times the usual oral dose. \n  Combination therapy (loop diuretic and thiazide/thiazide-like diuretic/\n  mineralocorticoid) may be required to enhance diuresis.205-207 However,  \n  care is required to avoid electrolyte disturbances, hypovolaemia and  \n  worsening renal dysfunction. \n Careful use of Renin Angiotensin System (RAS) blockers  \n  HF patients with stable, chronic mild-moderate renal insufficiency  \n  (eGFR > 30mls/min/1.73m2) should receive standard therapy with an  \n  ACE-I/ ARB and an MRA.490\n  A serum creatinine rise or GFR decrease by up to 30% from baseline  \n  may be acceptable before it becomes necessary to consider stopping  \n  or decreasing doses.221 \n  In patients with advanced renal failure, the decision to start or stop  \n  RAS blockers should be individualised.490\n  Consider withholding RAS blockers during aggressive diuresis in  \n  patients at high risk for WRF.  RAS blockers (and β-blockers) can be used in patients with HF who  \n  are on chronic dialysis therapy.\n Ultrafiltration \n  This involves the removal of plasma water across a semi-permeable  \n  membrane in response to a transmembrane pressure gradient.   It may be considered for congestive symptoms refractory to diuresis,  \n  but should be used in consultation with a nephrologist.\n491\n  Evidence for its efficacy in fluid removal is mixed at present.491  Haemodialysis \n  Criteria for possible need to initiate renal replacement therapy include:\n   Oliguria unresponsive to fluid resuscitation.\n   Severe hyperkalaemia (serum potassium > 6.5mmol/L).\n   Severe acidaemia (pH < 7.2). \n   Serum urea > 25mmol/L. \n    Serum creatinine > 300μmol/L. \n8.6  ADVANCED HEART FAILURE/REFRACTORY HEART FAILURE\nThese are patients with severe symptoms of HF despite maximal medical \ntherapy. Hospital admission is necessary for stabilisation. Meticulous control of fluid balance is important. Aggravating causes of HF as listed in Table 5, Page 39 should be identified and treated.\nThese patients may need specialised treatment in CCU or ICU. The following \nmay be required:\n Intravenous infusion of frusemide. These patients may require combination  \n loop diuretics and thiazides.\n Intravenous infusion of inotropes - low dose dobutamine (5mcg/kg/min) or  \n milrinone. These improve symptoms but no survival benefit has been  \n demonstrated.126,492\n Ultrafiltration in patients who are fluid overloaded.493 In most patients,  \n however, the relief is temporary.\nThe prognosis of these patients is poor. They should be referred to assess \nwhether they may be potential candidates for mechanical circulatory support (e.g. LVAD) and consideration for heart transplant.\n8.6.1 HEART TRANSPLANTHeart transplantation is a well-established treatment of refractory end stage \nHF. This definitive therapy for HF however is limited by the lack of donor organs.\n494,495All patients with severe symptomatic HF despite optimal medical therapy and no other alternative therapy option should be considered for heart transplant. They need to be referred to a HF specialist cardiac hospital for further evaluation.\nAssessment for heart transplant is done by a multispeciality, multidisciplinary \nteam and appropriate work up will be performed for eligibility.\nEligibility criteria to be considered for heart transplant include:\n Poor LVEF (< 25%).\n Recurrent HF hospitalisations.\n Major limitation of the patient’s daily activities.\n Poor effort tolerance i.e. peak VO2 (maximal oxygen consumption or  \n peak oxygen uptake) less than 10ml/kg/min (or < 50% predicted). VO2  \n max is the maximum rate of oxygen consumption measured during  \n incremental exercise ie exercise of increasing intensity and is widely  \n used as an indicator of cardiorespiratory fitness.\n Intravenous inotropic dependence for symptomatic relief or to maintain  \n end organ function.\n Motivated, psychologically stable and compliant to therapy.\nContraindications to heart transplant\n Active infection.\n Severe peripheral arterial or cerebrovascular disease.\n Malignancy within 5 years.\n Diabetes mellitus with widespread microvascular complications.\n Systemic disease with multi-organ dysfunction.\n Irreversible chronic kidney, liver or lung disease.\n Pharmacologically irreversible pulmonary hypertension.\n Other medical or psychosocial issues that would impact survival.\n8.6.2 MECHANICAL CIRCULATORY SUPPORT The use of mechanical circulatory support (e.g. LVAD), should be considered \nfor patients with potentially reversible or treatable conditions or as a bridge to heart transplant in suitable candidates.\nLVAD may also be used as destination therapy in candidates who are not \nsuitable for transplant. Patients have improvement in their symptoms when compared to optimal medical therapy.\n496,497 However, the rate of rehospitalisations \ndue to complications of bleeding, thrombosis and infections are high.496-498 \nMany patients also go into major depression. Thus, extensive discussion with the patient and family is necessary prior to LVAD implantation.8.7 PALLIATIVE AND END OF LIFE CARE\nDespite recent advances in therapy, for some patients, HF remains a \nprogressive disease and carries a poor prognosis. Patients with refractory symptoms despite guideline-directed medical therapy, should be considered for palliative and end of life care if they have the following characteristics:\n499\n Progressive functional decline (mental and physical) and dependence in  \n most activities of daily living.\n Severe HF symptoms with poor quality of life despite optimal pharmacological \n and non-pharmacological therapies.\n Frequent hospital admissions or serious episodes of decompensation  \n despite optimal therapies.\n Heart transplantation and mechanical circulatory support ruled out.\n Cardiac cachexia.\n Clinically judged to be near end of life.\nThe aim of palliative care in HF is to prevent and relieve suffering and to promote the best quality of life for patients and their families.\n500\nDespite the complexities of end-of-life issues in HF patients, there is minimal evidence-based guidance on the care of this population.\n501 The key components \nof end-of-life care are:\n 1. Advanced care plan with directives and informed decisions on:\n   Use or withdrawal of treatment including advanced therapies such  \n   as V inotropes, ICD and mechanical circulatory support. \n   When it would be appropriate to switch off devices such as ICD or  \n   CRT. \n   Resuscitation status.\n   Preferred location of death (i.e. at home or hospital).\n 2. Symptom management \n  Goals of care at this stage should shift from extending life to controlling \n  symptoms and maximising quality of life. Common symptoms include:\n   Dyspnoea\n   Fatigue\n   Pain\n   Urinary retention \n  Constipation\n  Cachexia\n  Depression\n Medications that may be useful include analgesics, antiemetics, anxiolytics,  \n opioids, laxatives, and diuretics, etc. \n3. Psychosocial support\n The impact of HF on quality of life for the patient and family is complex and  \n extends beyond physical symptoms.502\n Emotional, spiritual and social support should be provided to alleviate patient  \n anxiety about dying, and to guide patient towards a peaceful journey at the end  \n of life.\n9.1 LEVEL OF CARE AND SHARED MANAGEMENT \nThe care of patients with HF should ideally take place in a multidisciplinary system, \nallowing for shared care between the hospital (secondary or tertiary settings) and \ncommunity (primary setting). A multidisciplinary approach encompasses patient \neducation, cardiac rehabilitation, psychosocial support and palliative care, and has been proven to reduce HF hospitalisations and mortality in discharged patients.\n503-505\nThe multidisciplinary team usually consists of cardiologists and or general physicians, HF nurses, pharmacists, dieticians, physiotherapists, primary care \nproviders, social workers as well as geriatricians, psychologists, occupational \ntherapists and when necessary, palliative care specialists. Care can be done in two different settings: \n In the patient’s own home - home-based interventions are associated with  \n significantly lower healthcare costs, reduced hospital readmissions and an  \n improvement in the patient’s quality of life.506 This may however, not be feasible  \n in our local setting.\n Specialist outpatient clinic - the Heart Failure Clinic (HFC). \nHFCs can either be:\n Nurse-directed - these are run by nurses with special training in HF.\n Physician-directed - run by general physicians and/or cardiologists. \nHFCs can be established in the tertiary hospitals or in the primary care setting. The minimum human resource requirements are a:\n Cardiologist or general physician with an interest in cardiology and HF, \n Dedicated nurse and \n Medical technologist for blood taking, doing echocardiography and 6 minutes \n walk tests.In bigger clinic settings, the involvement of physiotherapists to encourage physical \nactivity, pharmacists and counsellors for end of life care would be advisable.\nThese clinics will be the intermediary between in-patient hospital care and community \nprimary care. Patients who can be seen in these clinics include those:507\n Recently discharged after an admission for decompensated HF (a waiting \n time of 7-12 days post discharge has to be the maximum wait-time).\n Who are in the early decompensation phase and need treatment modification.\n Who are stable but need uptitration of HF medications.\n With ICD or CRTs. \n With comorbidities, such as renal dysfunction, diabetes and COPD.\n With advanced HF who may benefit from:\n  Heart transplant\n  Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD)\n  Palliative care.\nThe objectives of these HF clinics may vary based on local settings. These include:\n507,508\n Optimisation of medical therapy particularly the uptitration of β-blockers, ACE-I  \n and MRA. \n Education of the patient and caregiver on the nature of the disease and its  \n progression. \n Promotion of self-care such as :\n  Compliance to medical therapy and fluid restriction.\n  Regular weighing and adjusting diuretic doses according to symptoms and  \n  body weight.\nPatient with optimised HF medications/treatment plans can be discharged to the \ncommunity with appropriate care plans to primary care. Close partnership between these HF clinics and primary care helps to reduce unnecessary admissions to hospital. \nIn 2018, the Heart Failure Medication Therapy Adherence Clinic (MTAC) was \nintroduced. These clinics are conducted by pharmacists in collaboration with doctors and other healthcare providers to improve HF management. The objectives of the Heart Failure MTAC are:\n509\n Enhance patient’s adherence to HF pharmacotherapy and non-pharmacological  \n interventions.\n To reduce unscheduled emergency department visits or hospitalisations of HF  \n patient due to acute decompensation.\n To provide consultative service to doctors on evidence-based HF pharmacotherapy  \n and related issues.\n To collaborate with doctors and other health care professionals in HF management  \n program.9.2 MONITORING AND FOLLOW-UP \nPatients with HF require regular follow-up and monitoring. Serial evaluations serve \nto assess a patient’s status, response to therapy, development of complications and disease progression. Key components of assessment include:\n Functional capacity - NYHA functional class or 6-minute walk test \n Fluid status and body weight \n Blood pressure, heart rate and rhythm \n Examination of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems\n Cognitive status and nutritional status \n Review of pharmacotherapy - uptitration, compliance and side effects\n Serum urea, electrolytes, creatinine and eGFR as necessary\n Diet and sodium intake\n Consumption of alcohol or illicit drugs\n Smoking history.\nThe frequency of follow-up will depend on the patient’s clinical stability and need for pharmacotherapy optimisation. A patient with a recent episode of decompensation or clinical instability, for instance, should ideally be seen again soon, usually within 2 weeks. Ultimately, the intensity and type of follow-up would be determined by the local organisation of care and resources.\nRoutine serial echocardiogram is not recommended. However, if there has been a \nrecent change in clinical status or if the patient has received treatment that might significantly change certain echocardiographic parameters, a follow-up echocardiogram is reasonable to assess the LVEF and structural remodeling.\nSerial brain natriuretic peptide measurements to guide and tailor HF therapy cannot \nbe broadly recommended at the present time due to a lack of consistent evidence.\n29-32 \n9.3 CARDIOLOGY REFERRAL \nHF patients with stable symptoms may be managed at the primary care level. \nReferral to the cardiologist should be considered in the following situations: \n De novo HF for a comprehensive workup to confirm the diagnosis and determine  \n the aetiology, and to devise a management plan.\n Episodes of acute decompensation.\n Worsening HF symptoms despite appropriate therapy. \n HF complicated with symptomatic hypotension or excessive bradycardia, limiting \n uptitration of pharmacotherapy. Symptomatic stable CAD and/or acute coronary syndrome for consideration of  \n revascularisation (PCI or CABG). \n Resuscitated cardiac arrest.\n Documented or suspected significant arrhythmias e.g. AF, VT.\n Significant valvular disease not previously assessed or worsening valvular  \n dysfunction.\n Pre-conception assessment and counselling of women with significant structural  \n heart disease and a past history of HF or LV dysfunction. \n Complex congenital cardiac lesions and/or Eisenmenger’s syndrome.\nDespite taking conventional HF therapy, patients may seek alternative therapy and healing approaches that are not considered as allopathic medicine. The National Centre for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) defines complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) as a group of diverse medical and healthcare interventions, practices, products or disciplines that are not generally considered part of conventional medicine.\n10.1 Enhanced External Counter Pulsation (EECP)\nThere is inadequate evidence of clinical effectiveness of EECP in HF.\n510-513 There is \nconcern that it could precipitate or exacerbate HF. \n10.2 Stem cell therapy\nA global position paper on cardiovascular regenerative medicine stated that \ncell-based therapy in HF patients is neither positive nor consistent.514 \n10.3 Omega 3 fatty acids\nIn patients with HFrEF, it may be considered as an adjunctive therapy based on a \nsingle randomised controlled trial (RCT) which showed a small benefit in CV death and/or hospitalisations.\n515,516 10.4 Coenzyme Q10\nThere is no convincing evidence to support or refute the use of coenzyme Q10 for \npatients with HF.517\n10.5 Tai Chi\nTai Chi may improve 6 min walk test distance, quality of life and LVEF in patients with \nHF.518,519 Its effect on hard CV outcomes such as rehospitalisation, MI and mortality \nis not known. \n10.6 YogaA meta-analysis in 2014 that includes two RCTs concluded that yoga improved peak \nVO2 (exercise capacity) and quality of life in chronic HF patients.\n520 There is an \nongoing RCT to look at the effect of yoga in HFpEF patients.521\nThe focus of future development for HF in Malaysia should be towards service \nenhancement working to meet the World Heart Federation mandate of a 25% reduction in premature non-communicable disease mortality by 2025. \nFinding the balance between costs and quality remains a global challenge, and the \nunderstanding of the disease in our healthcare context is imperative to making sure we move forward regarding service delivery, human resource allocation, medical expense costs and patient outcomes. To achieve this, the following need to be undertaken: \n Epidemiological studies to understand the disease profile in the country.\n Establishment and expansion of HFCs leading to more patient-centred HF care.\n Expanding service delivery, human resource allocation, medical expense cost  \n and patient outcomes.\n Education of healthcare personnel.\nEfforts should be directed to the knowledge and understanding of the epidemiology of HF in our country, its phenotype, presentation, current adherence to guideline-directed therapy and outcomes. Regular cluster sampling cohorts or a nationwide registry should be considered. Understanding the limitations of service delivery albeit geography or human resources and making plans for better service delivery systems \nare important.\nDevelopment of HFCs, can lead to a more patient-centric HF care. (See Section 9, Pages 110-113)\nModules for HF care need to be initiated in order to train and educate general \ninternal medicine physicians. A core-curriculum for education needs to be formed to ensure adequate training has been disseminated to HFC personnel.   \nIncentives regarding HF guidelines compliance should be implemented and HF \ninnovative practice should be encouraged with awards for best clinical practice and innovation be made available. \nThis streamline approach to HF care with engagement of connected groups hopefully \nwill help in better overall patient care and experience.\nPerformance measures should be used with the goal of improving quality of care for HF.\n518,519\nProcess performance measures focus on the aspects of care that are delivered to a patient, \nwhile outcome measures focus on the end-points such as mortality or hospitalisation.\nProcess performance indicators for in-patients with HF includes:522-524\n % of patients who had documentation of NYHA Functional Class.\n % of patients who had LVEF measurement.\n % of patients with current or prior LVEF < 40% and without contraindications  \n discharged with ACE-I/ARB. \n % of patients with current or prior LVEF < 40% and without contraindications  \n discharged on β-blockers.\n % of patients with current or prior LVEF < 40% and without contraindications  \n discharged on MRA.\n % of patients with chronic or paroxysmal AF/atrial flutter without contraindications  \n on anticoagulant therapy at discharge.\n % of patients given a post discharge appointment.\nThe accepted performance measure should be more than 60%.Outcome measures indicators include:\n In-hospital mortality\n 30-day readmission for HF\nRefer to Appendix VI, Page 121 for calculation of these measures.Appendix IV: Safety of Progesterone Only Contraceptive Methods in Women \nwith Cardiac Disease\nProgesterone Only  Cardiac Condition WHOMEC# ClassContraceptive Method\nProgesterone only pill\na All cardiac conditions  1\n Noriday® (should not normally be \n Cerazette®b  advised where pregnancy \n  poses a high or  \n  unacceptable risk -  \n  WHOMEC Class 3 and \n  4 conditions)\n  All cardiac patients  who   1\n  are not on warfarin\n  All cardiac patients on   3\n  warfarinc\nImplants e.g. \n(Nexplanon® previously  All cardiac patients  1\nknown as Implanon®)\n  Cardiac patients generally   1\n  even if taking warfarind\n   Structural heart diseasee  2\n  Prosthetic heart valvesd,e  3\n  Previous endocarditise  3\n  Pulmonary hypertension,   4(3)\n  Fontan circulation or other \n  condition in which vagal \n  reaction at insertion would \n  be poorly tolerated\nEmergency contraception All cardiac disease  1Intra-Uterine System e.g.Mirena\n®Depo Provera\n#WHOMEC: World Heart Organization Medical Eligibility Criteria (see Appendix III, Page 118)\naAlthough safe, the standard progestogen-only pill is less effective than all the other progestogen-only methods.\nbEfficacy reduced by Bosentan\ncRisk of haematoma at injection site\ndThe INR may be altered after initiation of any progesterone hormone therapy.

        "text": "14613.1 Introduction\nPaediatric heart failure (PHF) is a complex syndrome with heterogeneous \naetiology and presentation.1 It is an uncommon condition with a reported \nincidence of 0.87 to 7.4 per 100,000 population.2 It, however, causes                \nsignificant morbidity and mortality. \nUnlike adults with HF, PHF is commonly due to congenital heart disease \n(CHD) or cardiomyopathies. However, the general principles of management are similar to those in adults, except that there is a lack of randomised clinical trials and international guidelines for PHF.\n3 \n13.2 Definition\nThere are various definitions of PHF.1,4,5 PHF can be defined as\n “The failure of the heart to supply blood to either systemic or pulmonary  \n circulation at an appropriate rate of flow, or to receive venous return at an  \n appropriate filling pressure, resulting in adverse effects on the heart, the  \n circulation, and the patient”4  or\n “A clinical and pathophysiologic syndrome that results from ventricular  \n dysfunction, volume or pressure overload, alone or in combination that  \n leads to characteristic signs and symptoms, and is associated with \n circulatory, neurohormonal and molecular abnormalities”.5\n13.3 AetiologyIn children, cardiac failure is most often due to CHDs and cardiomyopathies.\n6 \n(Table 18, Page 152). \nCommon etiologies are:\n At birth - foetal cardiomyopathies, foetal arrhythmias or non-cardiac conditions \n (i.e., perinatal asphyxia, sepsis, hypoglycaemia, and hypocalcaemia). \n Within the first week of life - duct dependent systemic circulation, i.e.  \n closure or restriction of ductus arteriosus leading to a severe reduction of  \n end-organ perfusion in patients with critical aortic stenosis (AS), aortic  \n coarctation (CoA), and hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS). \n Within the first year of life - left to right shunts (i.e. large ventricular septal  \n defect (VSD), patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), atrioventricular septal \n defect (AVSD), aortopulmonary window (AP window), or cyanotic CHD with  \n non-protective pulmonary blood flow (i.e. transposition great arteries with   VSD, truncus arteriosus). In both these conditions, pulmonary blood flow   (PBF) progressively increases with the fall of pulmonary vascular resistance.\n Children and adolescence (1-18 years of age) - more often due to  \n rheumatic carditis, myocarditis or cardiomyopathies other than congenital  \n heart disease."

        "text": "14713.4 Clinical Presentation\nThe clinical presentation of HF varies with age. It may present at birth \n(because of foetal disease) or can develop at any stage of childhood. Table 19, Page 153 summarises the clinical presentation of paediatric HF according to the different age groups. \nThe clinical presentation of HF in neonates and infants are non-specific, and \ncardiac murmurs may be absent or very soft. Absence of femoral pulse or presence of radio-femoral delay may suggest coarctation of aorta. \nHence, it is very important to exclude underlying cardiac disease in younger \ninfants with feeding difficulties, respiratory distress, and growth failure. Furthermore, features of HF in adults such as ankle oedema are rarely seen in infants and children.\nThe severity of HF is staged based on modified Ross classification as shown \nin Table 20, Page 153. Briefly, class 1 is absence of symptoms and class 4 is severe symptoms of HF. \nAcute heart failure in children may present with hypotension or tachycardia \nwith narrow pulse pressure, cool extremities, and irritable or decreased consciousness. It is usually seen in cardiomyopathies, myocarditis, and left ventricular outflow tract obstructions such as critical/severe aortic stenosis or coarctation of aorta.\n13.5  Diagnosis PHF is a clinical diagnosis, and any child presenting with symptoms and \nsigns of HF needs assessment to establish the diagnosis and haemodynamic status.\n7 The initial steps of management are non-invasive investigations to \nlook for the aetiology and assess the severity of HF. \nThese include blood investigations, electrocardiogram (ECG), chest \nradiograph, echocardiogram. Occasionally, other investigations such as cardiac catheterisation, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or CT scan may be necessary.\n13.5.1 Essential investigations (Tables 21 and 22, Pages 154 and 155) Initial therapy to reduce pulmonary congestion or to improve perfusion should \nnot be delayed while waiting for the results of the investigations."

Features to look for are:\n Size of the heart (small, normal or, large) - \n  In the neonate and small infant, the thymic shadow may be confused  \n  as cardiomegaly. In these cases, a lateral CXR may be helpful.   The incidental finding of cardiomegaly in asymptomatic infants would  \n  warrant further investigations with an echocardiogram. \n Contours of the heart \n Pulmonary vascularity (increase, normal, and decrease) \n Signs of fluid overload such as cardiomegaly, septal lines (or Kerley B  \n lines), and pleural effusions.\nECG \n The ECG is always abnormal in children with HF. However, the findings  \n are generally non-specific - e.g. sinus tachycardia and left ventricular  \n hypertrophy. \n ECG may be diagnostic in HF secondary to tachy - or bradyarrhythmias  \n (e.g. supraventricular tachycardia, atrial ectopic tachycardia, heart block). \n A continuous ECG monitoring (Holter) is indicated in any patient presenting  \n with unexplained dilated cardiomyopathy for possible tachycardia-induced  \n cardiomyopathy. 2D-echocardiogram This will provide information on: \n Structural cardiac defects (volume or pressure overload), \n Chamber sizes (dilated left atrium and ventricle in left to right shunt), and \n Cardiac function (a poor cardiac function with dilated left ventricle in  \n myocarditis or dilated cardiomyopathies.13.6 Management The therapeutic approach should be tailored to the clinical status at presentation \nand the underlying cause of HF.

Therefore, the goal of therapy is  \n to return the patient to a euvolemic state with good perfusion. \n Anaemia should be treated cautiously. If indicated, blood transfusion  \n should be given in small volumes (5-10ml/kg) to avoid worsening  \n symptoms. Following stabilisation, efforts should be made to identify and treat the underlying \ncause. All treatable structural heart defects should have corrective surgery and/or interventional therapy as early as possible. \nIn cases of HF due to cardiomyopathy or myocarditis, long-term medical \ntherapy is necessary.\nCommon medications include: (Table 24, Page 157) \n Loop diuretics - frusemide\n  Indicated in the treatment of HF due to volume overload.\n   In decompensated HF, a slow intravenous infusion of frusemide  \n  would avoid worsening the hypotension as compared to intermittent  \n  bolus injections.8 \n  The addition of spironolactone (potassium sparing) avoids the need  \n  for potassium supplements.
